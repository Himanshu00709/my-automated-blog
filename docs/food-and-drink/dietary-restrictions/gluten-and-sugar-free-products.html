    <h1>Gluten and Sugar-Free Products: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free and sugar-free products has skyrocketed. Whether due to dietary restrictions, health concerns, or personal preferences, more people are turning to these alternatives.

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Sugar</h2>

    <p>Before diving into the products, it's essential to understand what gluten and sugar are. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It gives dough its elasticity and helps it rise. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues. On the other hand, sugar is a simple carbohydrate that provides energy but can contribute to various health problems when consumed in excess, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.</p>

        <li><strong>Increased Energy Levels:</strong> Some people report feeling more energetic after switching to a gluten-free diet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Benefits of Sugar-Free Products</h2>

        <li><strong>Blood Sugar Control:</strong> For individuals with diabetes, sugar-free products can help maintain stable blood sugar levels.</li>
