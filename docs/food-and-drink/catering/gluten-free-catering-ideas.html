<h1>Gluten-Free Catering Ideas: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free catering has skyrocketed. Whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal dietary preferences, more people are seeking gluten-free options at events. Catering to this need doesn’t have to be daunting.
