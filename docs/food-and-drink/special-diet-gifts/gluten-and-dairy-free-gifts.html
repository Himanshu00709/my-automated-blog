<h2>Why Gluten and Dairy-Free Gifts Matter</h2>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or lactose intolerance, consuming gluten or dairy can lead to uncomfortable or even dangerous health issues. Gluten, found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive problems, fatigue, and inflammation for those with sensitivities. Similarly, dairy can trigger bloating, gas, and other digestive discomforts for those who are lactose intolerant. By choosing gluten and dairy-free gifts, you’re not only being considerate but also helping them maintain their health and enjoy their treats without worry.</p>

<p>For those who love to bake, gluten and dairy-free baking kits are a wonderful gift. These kits come with pre-measured ingredients and recipes for making everything from cookies to cakes. They’re perfect for beginners and experienced bakers alike, and they ensure that the end product is safe for those with dietary restrictions.</p>

<h3>3. Specialty Coffee or Tea</h3>

<p>A high-quality bag of coffee or a selection of specialty teas can be a luxurious gift for someone who avoids gluten and dairy.
