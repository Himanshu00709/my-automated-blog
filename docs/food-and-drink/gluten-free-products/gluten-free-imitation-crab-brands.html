    <h1>Gluten-Free Imitation Crab Brands: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Imitation crab, also known as surimi, is a popular seafood alternative made from processed fish, typically pollock. It’s a versatile ingredient used in sushi rolls, salads, and various seafood dishes. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding gluten-free imitation crab can be a challenge. Many brands use wheat starch or other gluten-containing ingredients as binders. In this article, we’ll explore the best gluten-free imitation crab brands, their nutritional profiles, and how to incorporate them into your diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Imitation Crab?</h2>

    <p>Imitation crab is a seafood product made from finely pulverized white fish, usually pollock, which is then mixed with other ingredients like starch, sugar, egg whites, and flavorings. The mixture is shaped and colored to resemble crab meat. While it’s a cost-effective alternative to real crab, it’s important to note that imitation crab is not a direct substitute in terms of flavor or texture. However, it’s widely used in dishes like California rolls, crab salads, and seafood casseroles.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Imitation Crab?</h2>

    <p>For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Traditional imitation crab often contains wheat starch, which is used as a binder. Therefore, it’s crucial to identify gluten-free options to avoid these health risks. Fortunately, several brands now offer gluten-free imitation crab products, making it easier for gluten-sensitive individuals to enjoy this seafood alternative.</p>
