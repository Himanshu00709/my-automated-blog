<h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Party Food: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Hosting a party can be a delightful experience, but it can also be challenging when you need to cater to guests with dietary restrictions. Gluten and dairy-free diets are becoming increasingly common due to allergies, intolerances, or personal health choices.

<p>Gluten and dairy are two of the most common allergens and intolerances. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe reactions in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Dairy, on the other hand, contains lactose, which many people have difficulty digesting. By offering gluten and dairy-free options, you ensure that all your guests can partake in the festivities without worry.</p>
