    <h1>Understanding Sorghum and Gluten: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, sorghum has gained significant attention as a versatile and nutritious grain, particularly among those seeking gluten-free alternatives. As gluten-related disorders such as celiac disease and gluten sensitivity become more prevalent, understanding the role of sorghum in a gluten-free diet is essential. This article delves into the relationship between sorghum and gluten, exploring its nutritional benefits, culinary uses, and why it’s a safe choice for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Sorghum?</h2>
    <p>Sorghum, scientifically known as <em>Sorghum bicolor</em>, is a cereal grain that has been cultivated for thousands of years. Originating in Africa, it is now grown worldwide, particularly in regions with hot and arid climates. Sorghum is a staple food in many parts of the world, especially in Africa and Asia, where it is used to make porridge, flatbreads, and beverages.</p>

    <p>This ancient grain is not only drought-resistant but also highly nutritious. It is rich in fiber, protein, antioxidants, and essential minerals such as iron, magnesium, and phosphorus. Sorghum is also naturally gluten-free, making it an excellent option for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in certain grains, including wheat, barley, and rye. It provides elasticity to dough, helping it rise and maintain its shape. While gluten is harmless for most people, it can cause serious health issues for those with celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergy.</p>

    <p>For individuals with these conditions, consuming gluten can lead to symptoms such as digestive discomfort, fatigue, skin rashes, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. As a result, a strict gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment for managing these conditions.</p>

    <h2>Why Sorghum is Gluten-Free</h2>
    <p>Sorghum is naturally gluten-free, meaning it does not contain the proteins that trigger adverse reactions in individuals with gluten-related disorders. Unlike wheat, barley, and rye, sorghum belongs to a different botanical family, making it a safe and nutritious alternative for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <p>Moreover, sorghum is often grown and processed in facilities that do not handle gluten-containing grains, reducing the risk of cross-contamination. This makes it a reliable choice for individuals who need to adhere to a strict gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Sorghum</h2>
    <p>Sorghum is not only gluten-free but also packed with essential nutrients that contribute to overall health. Below is a table highlighting the nutritional profile of sorghum per 100 grams:</p>
