    <h1>How to Do Surgery: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Surgery is one of the most critical and complex medical procedures, requiring precision, knowledge, and a steady hand. Whether you're a medical student, a budding surgeon, or simply curious about the process, this guide will walk you through the essential steps of performing surgery. From preparation to post-operative care, we’ll cover everything you need to know.</p>

    <h2>1. Preparation for Surgery</h2>
    <p>Before any surgical procedure, thorough preparation is key. This involves both the surgeon and the patient. Here’s what you need to do:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Patient Evaluation:</strong> Conduct a detailed medical history and physical examination. Ensure the patient is fit for surgery.</li>
        <li><strong>Informed Consent:</strong> Explain the procedure, risks, and benefits to the patient and obtain their consent.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-operative Tests:</strong> Perform necessary tests such as blood work, imaging, and ECG to assess the patient’s condition.</li>
        <li><strong>Surgical Team Briefing:</strong> Ensure the entire surgical team is aware of the procedure, their roles, and any potential complications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. The Surgical Procedure</h2>
    <p>Once the preparation is complete, the actual surgery begins. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Step</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1. Anesthesia</td>
                <td>Administer anesthesia to ensure the patient is pain-free and unconscious during the procedure.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2. Incision</td>
                <td>Make a precise incision to access the surgical site. The size and location depend on the type of surgery.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3. Procedure</td>
                <td>Perform the necessary surgical steps, such as removing tissue, repairing organs, or implanting devices.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4. Closure</td>
                <td>Close the incision using sutures, staples, or adhesive. Ensure the wound is properly sealed to prevent infection.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>3. Post-Operative Care</h2>
    <p>After the surgery, the patient’s recovery is just as important as the procedure itself. Here’s what to focus on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Keep a close eye on the patient’s vital signs and watch for any signs of complications.</li>
        <li><strong>Pain Management:</strong> Administer pain relief medications as needed to keep the patient comfortable.</li>
        <li><strong>Wound Care:</strong> Regularly check and clean the surgical site to prevent infection.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow-Up:</strong> Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor the patient’s recovery and address any concerns.</li>
    </ul>
