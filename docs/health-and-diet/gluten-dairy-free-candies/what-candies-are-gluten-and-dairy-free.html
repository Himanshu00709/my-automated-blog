<h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Candies: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with gluten intolerance, celiac disease, or lactose intolerance, finding safe and delicious treats can be a challenge. Fortunately, the candy industry has made significant strides in offering gluten-free and dairy-free options. In this guide, we’ll explore the world of gluten and dairy-free candies, providing you with a detailed list of options, tips for identifying safe products, and answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Dairy-Free Diets</h2>

<p>Before diving into the list of candies, it’s essential to understand what it means for a product to be gluten-free or dairy-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Dairy-free products, on the other hand, do not contain milk or any milk-derived ingredients, making them suitable for those with lactose intolerance or a dairy allergy.</p>

<p>When selecting candies, it’s crucial to read labels carefully. Look for certifications like "Certified Gluten-Free" or "Dairy-Free" to ensure the product meets your dietary needs. Additionally, be aware of cross-contamination risks, especially in facilities that process both gluten-containing and gluten-free products.</p>
