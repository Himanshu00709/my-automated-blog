    <h1>Gluten-Free Panties: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, not just in the food industry but also in the fashion world. One of the most intriguing developments in this space is the emergence of gluten-free panties. While it may sound like a niche product, gluten-free panties are gaining traction among individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those who simply want to avoid gluten in all aspects of their lives.

While most people focus on avoiding gluten in their diet, they may not realize that gluten can also be present in clothing, particularly in fabrics that have been treated with wheat-based starches or adhesives. Gluten-free panties are made from materials that are free from these gluten-containing substances, providing peace of mind for those who need to avoid gluten entirely.</p>

    <h2>Materials Used in Gluten-Free Panties</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free panties are typically made from natural, hypoallergenic materials that are free from gluten and other common allergens. Some of the most common materials used include:</p>
