<h1>What is Glute Massage? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Glute massage, also known as gluteal massage, is a therapeutic technique that focuses on the muscles of the buttocks. This type of massage is designed to relieve tension, improve flexibility, and enhance overall muscle function. Whether you're an athlete, someone with a sedentary lifestyle, or simply looking to alleviate lower back pain, glute massage can offer significant benefits.

Due to their constant use, the glutes can become tight, overworked, or even injured, leading to discomfort and pain.</p>
