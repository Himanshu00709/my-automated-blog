    <h1>Gluten-Free Bath Bombs: A Luxurious and Safe Soak</h1>

    <p>In recent years, bath bombs have become a staple in self-care routines, offering a luxurious and aromatic experience that transforms an ordinary bath into a spa-like retreat. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the ingredients in bath products can be a cause for concern.
