    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened almond milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chia seeds (mixed with 3 tablespoons water to make a chia egg)</li>
        <li>Optional toppings: sesame seeds, poppy seeds, garlic powder, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix the almond milk, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup, and chia egg. Let the mixture sit for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
        <li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms. The dough should be slightly sticky but manageable.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 6 equal portions and shape each portion into a bagel shape. You can do this by rolling the dough into a ball and then poking a hole in the center with your finger.</li>
        <li>Place the bagels on the prepared baking sheet and brush the tops with a little almond milk. Sprinkle with your desired toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the bagels are golden brown and firm to the touch.</li>
        <li>Allow the bagels to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy with your favorite vegan spreads or toppings!</li>
