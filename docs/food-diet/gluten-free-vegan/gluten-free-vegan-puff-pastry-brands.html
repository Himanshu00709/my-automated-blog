    <h2>How to Use Gluten-Free Vegan Puff Pastry</h2>

    <p>Using gluten-free vegan puff pastry is similar to working with traditional puff pastry, but there are a few tips to keep in mind to ensure the best results. First, always thaw the pastry according to the package instructions. Over-thawing can make it sticky and difficult to handle. When rolling out the dough, use a lightly floured surface (with gluten-free flour) to prevent sticking. If the pastry cracks, don’t worry—it can often be pressed back together. Finally, be mindful of baking times, as gluten-free pastries may brown faster than their gluten-containing counterparts.</p>
