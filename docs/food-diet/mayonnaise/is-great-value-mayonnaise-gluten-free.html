    <h1>Is Great Value Mayonnaise Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Mayonnaise is a staple condiment in many households, used in everything from sandwiches to salads. For individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, ensuring that their food is gluten-free is crucial. One popular brand that often comes into question is Great Value, Walmart's private label. In this article, we will explore whether Great Value Mayonnaise is gluten-free, delve into its ingredients, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health problems. Therefore, it's essential for these individuals to avoid gluten-containing products.</p>

    <p>Mayonnaise, in its traditional form, is typically made from oil, egg yolks, vinegar, and seasonings. None of these ingredients inherently contain gluten. However, cross-contamination or the addition of gluten-containing additives can make some mayonnaise products unsafe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Great Value Mayonnaise Ingredients</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Great Value Mayonnaise is gluten-free, we need to examine its ingredients. Here is a breakdown of the ingredients listed on the label:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Potential Gluten Content</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Soybean Oil</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Water</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Egg Yolks</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Distilled Vinegar</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sugar</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lemon Juice Concentrate</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Calcium Disodium EDTA</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Natural Flavors</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free (but check for potential cross-contamination)</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As you can see, the primary ingredients in Great Value Mayonnaise are naturally gluten-free. However, the inclusion of "natural flavors" can sometimes be a point of concern. Natural flavors can be derived from a variety of sources, and while they are generally considered safe, there is a slight risk of cross-contamination if the flavors are processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products.</p>

    <h2>Is Great Value Mayonnaise Certified Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>While the ingredients in Great Value Mayonnaise do not contain gluten, it is important to note that the product is not certified gluten-free. Certification by organizations like the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO) ensures that a product meets strict gluten-free standards, including testing for gluten levels below 20 parts per million (ppm).</p>

    <p>Without this certification, there is always a small risk of cross-contamination during manufacturing. For individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, this could be a concern. However, for those with mild gluten sensitivities, Great Value Mayonnaise is likely safe to consume.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process if the same equipment is used to process gluten-containing products. While Great Value Mayonnaise does not contain gluten ingredients, the lack of certification means that there is no guarantee that the product is entirely free from gluten contamination.</p>

    <p>If you are highly sensitive to gluten, it may be worth reaching out to Walmart's customer service for more information about their manufacturing processes and whether they have protocols in place to prevent cross-contamination.</p>
