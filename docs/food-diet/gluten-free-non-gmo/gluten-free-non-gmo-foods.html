    <h1>Gluten-Free Non-GMO Foods: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free and non-GMO foods has skyrocketed. Whether due to dietary restrictions, health concerns, or ethical considerations, more people are seeking out foods that are free from gluten and genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This guide will explore the benefits of gluten-free non-GMO foods, provide tips for incorporating them into your diet, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Non-GMO Foods?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free non-GMO foods are products that do not contain gluten—a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye—and are also free from genetically modified organisms. These foods are often sought after by individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those who prefer to avoid GMOs for health or environmental reasons.</p>

        <li><strong>Improved Digestion:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, avoiding gluten can lead to better digestion and reduced gastrointestinal discomfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Allergic Reactions:</strong> Non-GMO foods are less likely to cause allergic reactions, as they are not genetically altered in ways that could introduce new allergens.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Non-GMO farming practices are often more sustainable and environmentally friendly, reducing the use of harmful pesticides and promoting biodiversity.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthier Lifestyle:</strong> Many gluten-free non-GMO foods are whole, unprocessed foods that contribute to a healthier diet overall.</li>
    </ul>
