    <h1>Where to Buy Gluten-Free Wheat Starch: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular over the years, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals seeking healthier eating habits. One of the challenges of maintaining a gluten-free diet is finding suitable alternatives to common ingredients, such as wheat starch.

        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> It can be used in a wide range of recipes, from bread and cakes to sauces and gravies.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> While it is not a significant source of nutrients, it provides a neutral base that can be enriched with other healthy ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Safe for Celiac Patients:</strong> When properly processed, gluten-free wheat starch contains less than 20 ppm of gluten, making it safe for most individuals with celiac disease.</li>
