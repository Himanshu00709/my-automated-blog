<h1>Gluten-Free Ham Brands: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding safe and delicious gluten-free products can be a challenge. Ham, a popular protein choice, is often a staple in many households, especially during holidays and special occasions. However, not all ham brands are created equal when it comes to gluten-free options. In this article, we will explore some of the best gluten-free ham brands available, discuss what to look for when purchasing gluten-free ham, and provide tips for ensuring your ham is safe to eat.</p>

<h2>What Makes Ham Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Ham, in its purest form, is naturally gluten-free. It is made from the hind leg of a pig and is typically cured or smoked. However, the issue arises when manufacturers add flavorings, seasonings, or preservatives that may contain gluten. Cross-contamination during processing is another concern. Therefore, it's essential to choose ham brands that are certified gluten-free or clearly labeled as such.</p>
