<h1>Gluten-Free Substitutes for Oats: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply choosing to avoid gluten, finding safe and nutritious alternatives to common foods is essential. Oats, while naturally gluten-free, are often contaminated with gluten during processing.

Therefore, it is essential to seek out certified gluten-free oats or explore other gluten-free grain options.</p>
