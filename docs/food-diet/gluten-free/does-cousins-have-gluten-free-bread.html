<h1>Does Cousins Have Gluten-Free Bread? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the growing popularity of gluten-free diets. For those who must avoid gluten, finding safe and delicious options at restaurants can be a challenge. One common question that arises is: <strong>Does Cousins have gluten-free bread?</strong> In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free offerings at Cousins, discuss the importance of gluten-free options, and provide tips for dining out safely.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Symptoms can range from digestive issues to fatigue, skin rashes, and even neurological problems. Gluten sensitivity, while not as severe as celiac disease, can still cause discomfort and health problems for those affected.</p>

<p>Given the potential health risks, it’s crucial for individuals with gluten-related disorders to have access to safe, gluten-free food options. This is where restaurants like Cousins come into play.</p>

<h2>Does Cousins Offer Gluten-Free Bread?</h2>

<p>Cousins Subs, a popular sandwich chain, has recognized the growing need for gluten-free options. As of the latest updates, Cousins does offer gluten-free bread for their sandwiches. This is a significant step forward in catering to customers with dietary restrictions. However, it’s important to note that while the bread itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can still occur in the kitchen. Therefore, individuals with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease should exercise caution and communicate their needs clearly to the staff.</p>
