<h1>Are Sesame Balls Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Sesame balls, also known as <em>Jian Dui</em> or <em>Matuan</em>, are a popular Asian dessert made from glutinous rice flour, filled with sweet red bean paste, and coated with sesame seeds. These chewy, sweet treats are a favorite in many cultures, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Are sesame balls gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, preparation methods, and potential gluten risks associated with sesame balls. We’ll also provide tips for ensuring your sesame balls are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What Are Sesame Balls Made Of?</h2>

<p>Sesame balls are traditionally made with a few key ingredients:</p>

    <li><strong>Sweet Red Bean Paste:</strong> This filling is typically made from adzuki beans, sugar, and sometimes oil. It’s naturally gluten-free.</li>
    <li><strong>Sesame Seeds:</strong> These are used to coat the outer layer of the balls and are also gluten-free.</li>
    <li><strong>Water and Sugar:</strong> These are used to bind the dough and add sweetness.</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, sesame balls seem to be a safe option for those avoiding gluten. However, there are some factors to consider, especially when purchasing pre-made sesame balls or dining out.</p>
