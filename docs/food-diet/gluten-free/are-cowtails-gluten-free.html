    <h1>Are Cowtails Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, determining whether a particular food item is gluten-free is crucial. Cowtails, a popular chewy candy, often come under scrutiny for their ingredients. In this article, we will delve into whether Cowtails are gluten-free, explore their ingredients, and provide a detailed analysis to help you make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>What Are Cowtails?</h2>

    <p>Cowtails are a type of chewy candy that originated in the United States. They are known for their unique shape and creamy caramel center, which is surrounded by a chewy outer layer. The candy is often enjoyed by both children and adults due to its sweet and satisfying texture.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Cowtails</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Cowtails are gluten-free, it's essential to examine their ingredients. The primary ingredients in Cowtails include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Corn Syrup</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Palm Oil</li>
        <li>Whey</li>
        <li>Nonfat Milk</li>
        <li>Caramel</li>
        <li>Natural and Artificial Flavors</li>
        <li>Soy Lecithin</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Are Cowtails Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>To ensure that Cowtails are safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it's crucial to look for a gluten-free certification on the packaging. Unfortunately, Cowtails do not currently carry a gluten-free certification. Therefore, while the ingredients suggest that they are gluten-free, there is a risk of cross-contamination.</p>
