    <h1>Five Guys Gluten-Free Buns: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can often be a challenge. However, Five Guys, a popular fast-food chain known for its customizable burgers and fries, has made strides in accommodating gluten-free diets. One of the most notable additions to their menu is the gluten-free bun option. In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about Five Guys' gluten-free buns, including their ingredients, nutritional information, and how they compare to traditional buns.</p>

    <h2>What Are Five Guys Gluten-Free Buns?</h2>

    <p>Five Guys introduced gluten-free buns as part of their commitment to catering to a wider range of dietary needs.

Five Guys does not have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen, so there is a risk of gluten exposure from shared cooking surfaces and utensils. Customers with severe gluten allergies or celiac disease should exercise caution and communicate their dietary needs clearly to the staff.</p>
