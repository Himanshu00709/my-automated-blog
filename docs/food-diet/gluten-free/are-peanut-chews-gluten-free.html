<h1>Are Peanut Chews Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of snacks can be a daunting task. One popular treat that often comes into question is the beloved Peanut Chews. These chewy, chocolatey, and peanut-packed candies have been a favorite for decades. But are Peanut Chews gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and everything you need to know to determine if Peanut Chews are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What Are Peanut Chews?</h2>

<p>Peanut Chews are a classic American candy that originated in Philadelphia in 1917. They are made with a combination of roasted peanuts, molasses, and a chocolatey coating. Over the years, they have gained a loyal following due to their unique texture and rich flavor. However, for those who need to avoid gluten, understanding the ingredients and production process is crucial.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Peanut Chews</h2>

<p>To determine if Peanut Chews are gluten-free, we first need to examine the ingredients. The primary components of Peanut Chews include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Roasted peanuts</li>
    <li>Molasses</li>
    <li>Corn syrup</li>
    <li>Chocolate coating</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Soy lecithin</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, these ingredients do not contain gluten. However, it’s important to consider potential cross-contamination during the manufacturing process, which we’ll discuss later in this article.</p>

<h2>Are Peanut Chews Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>The good news is that Peanut Chews are generally considered gluten-free. The manufacturer, Just Born, Inc., has stated that their Peanut Chews do not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, they also note that the product is produced in a facility that processes wheat, which means there is a risk of cross-contamination.</p>

<p>For individuals with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease, this cross-contamination risk may be a concern. It’s always best to consult with your healthcare provider if you have any doubts or concerns about consuming products that may have been exposed to gluten during manufacturing.</p>

<h2>Understanding Cross-Contamination</h2>

<p>Cross-contamination occurs when a gluten-free product comes into contact with gluten-containing ingredients or surfaces during production. This can happen in facilities that process both gluten-free and gluten-containing products. Even trace amounts of gluten can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity.</p>

<p>In the case of Peanut Chews, the manufacturer has stated that while the product itself does not contain gluten, it is produced in a facility that also processes wheat. This means that there is a possibility of cross-contamination, although the risk is generally considered low.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

<p>One way to ensure that a product is truly gluten-free is to look for gluten-free certification from a reputable organization. Unfortunately, Peanut Chews do not currently carry a gluten-free certification. This means that while the product is made without gluten-containing ingredients, it has not been independently verified to meet strict gluten-free standards.</p>

<p>For those who require a certified gluten-free product, it may be best to look for alternatives that carry a gluten-free certification label.</p>

<h2>Alternatives to Peanut Chews</h2>
