    <h1>Are All Peeps Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Peeps, those iconic marshmallow candies shaped like chicks and bunnies, are a staple during Easter and other holidays. But for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Peeps are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential cross-contamination risks to determine if all Peeps are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Peeps Made Of?</h2>

    <p>Peeps are primarily made from sugar, corn syrup, gelatin, and various food colorings and flavorings. These ingredients are generally gluten-free, but it’s essential to look at the specifics to ensure there are no hidden sources of gluten. Below is a breakdown of the typical ingredients found in Peeps:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Sugar</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Corn Syrup</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Gelatin</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Food Colorings</td>
                <td>Generally Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Flavorings</td>
                <td>Generally Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>While the primary ingredients in Peeps are gluten-free, it’s important to consider the manufacturing process and potential cross-contamination, which we’ll discuss in the next section.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients in Peeps are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can pose a risk for those with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Cross-contamination can occur if gluten-containing products are processed on the same equipment as Peeps. To address this concern, it’s essential to look at the manufacturer’s practices and labeling.</p>

    <p>Just Born, the company that produces Peeps, states that their marshmallow candies are gluten-free. However, they also note that their facilities handle wheat, which could introduce a risk of cross-contamination. For individuals with celiac disease, this is an important consideration. Below is a summary of Just Born’s stance on gluten-free products:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Product</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Claim</th>
                <th>Cross-Contamination Risk</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Peeps Marshmallow Candies</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
                <td>Possible (due to shared facilities)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Other Just Born Products</td>
                <td>Varies</td>
                <td>Varies</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>If you have celiac disease or a severe gluten intolerance, it’s advisable to contact the manufacturer directly or consult with a healthcare professional before consuming Peeps.</p>

    <h2>Are Seasonal and Specialty Peeps Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Peeps come in various seasonal and specialty flavors, such as pumpkin spice for Halloween or peppermint for Christmas. While the classic Peeps are generally considered gluten-free, it’s important to check the labels of these specialty varieties. Some flavors may contain additional ingredients that could introduce gluten.</p>

    <p>For example, certain flavored Peeps might include additives or coatings that are not gluten-free. Always read the ingredient list and look for any gluten-containing ingredients like malt or wheat-based additives. If in doubt, reach out to Just Born for clarification.</p>
