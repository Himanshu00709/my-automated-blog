    <h1>Is Bulgur Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Bulgur is a staple in many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean diets, known for its nutty flavor and versatility in dishes like tabbouleh and pilafs. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether bulgur is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten content of bulgur, its nutritional profile, and alternatives for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Bulgur?</h2>

    <p>Bulgur is a whole grain made from cracked wheat kernels that have been parboiled, dried, and then ground. It’s a quick-cooking grain that’s rich in fiber, protein, and essential nutrients like iron and magnesium. Due to its high fiber content, bulgur is often recommended for digestive health and weight management.</p>

    <h2>Is Bulgur Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Unfortunately, bulgur is <strong>not gluten-free</strong>. Since it is made from wheat, it contains gluten, a protein that can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Gluten is responsible for the elastic texture of dough and is found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives.</p>

    <p>For those who must avoid gluten, consuming bulgur can lead to symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine in the case of celiac disease. Therefore, it’s essential to choose gluten-free alternatives if you have a gluten-related disorder.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Profile of Bulgur</h2>
