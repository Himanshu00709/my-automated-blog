    <h3>Basic Gluten-Free Bread Recipe</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>1 tsp xanthan gum</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>

        <li>1 1/4 cups warm water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the warm water, olive oil, and eggs. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Pour the dough into a greased loaf pan and let it rise for 30 minutes. Bake at 375°F for 30-35 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.</p>
