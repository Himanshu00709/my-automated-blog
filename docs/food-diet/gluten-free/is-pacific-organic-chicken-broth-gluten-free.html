<h1>Is Pacific Organic Chicken Broth Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>When it comes to maintaining a gluten-free diet, every ingredient matters. For those who are gluten-sensitive or have celiac disease, even the smallest trace of gluten can cause significant health issues. One common kitchen staple that often raises questions is chicken broth. Specifically, many people wonder: <strong>Is Pacific Organic Chicken Broth gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to provide a comprehensive answer.</p>

<h2>What is Pacific Organic Chicken Broth?</h2>

<p>Pacific Foods is a well-known brand that specializes in organic and natural food products. Their organic chicken broth is a popular choice for soups, stews, and other recipes. Made from organic chicken, vegetables, and herbs, this broth is designed to be a healthier alternative to conventional broths. But the question remains: does it meet the standards for a gluten-free diet?</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It’s commonly found in bread, pasta, and baked goods, but it can also be hidden in less obvious products like sauces, soups, and broths. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine.</p>

<p>When evaluating whether a product like Pacific Organic Chicken Broth is gluten-free, it’s essential to consider both the ingredients and the manufacturing process. Cross-contamination can occur if the product is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing foods.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Pacific Organic Chicken Broth</h2>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at the ingredients listed on the packaging of Pacific Organic Chicken Broth:</p>

According to the company, their facilities are designed to minimize the risk of cross-contact with gluten-containing ingredients.</p>
