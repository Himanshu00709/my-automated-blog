<p>Marshmallows are typically made from sugar, water, and gelatin, all of which are gluten-free. However, some marshmallow brands may include additional ingredients or flavorings that contain gluten. Additionally, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. Always read the ingredient list and look for a gluten-free label to be sure.</p>
