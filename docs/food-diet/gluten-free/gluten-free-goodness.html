    <h1>Gluten-Free Goodness: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the gluten-free diet has gained immense popularity, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also among health-conscious individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle. Gluten-free eating is more than just a trend; it’s a necessity for some and a choice for others. This guide will explore the benefits, challenges, and delicious possibilities of a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It acts as a glue that helps foods maintain their shape, providing elasticity and chewiness. While gluten is harmless for most people, it can cause serious health issues for those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergy.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of a Gluten-Free Diet</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, a gluten-free diet is essential. However, even for those without these conditions, there are potential benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Digestive Health:</strong> Eliminating gluten can reduce bloating, gas, and diarrhea in sensitive individuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Energy Levels:</strong> Some people report feeling more energetic after cutting out gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Nutrient Absorption:</strong> For those with celiac disease, a gluten-free diet can help heal the gut, improving nutrient absorption.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight Management:</strong> A gluten-free diet can lead to healthier food choices, aiding in weight management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Foods to Enjoy</h2>
