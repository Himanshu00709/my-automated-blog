    <h2>Do Fortune Cookies Contain Gluten?</h2>

    <p>Yes, traditional fortune cookies contain gluten because they are made with wheat flour. Wheat flour is a primary source of gluten, a protein that gives baked goods their structure and elasticity. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and skin problems.</p>

    <p>It’s important to note that even small amounts of gluten can be harmful to those with celiac disease. Therefore, traditional fortune cookies are not safe for individuals who need to follow a strict gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Fortune Cookies</h2>

    <p>Fortunately, there are gluten-free alternatives available for those who want to enjoy the experience of cracking open a fortune cookie without the gluten. Many specialty brands now offer gluten-free fortune cookies made with alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour. These gluten-free versions are designed to mimic the texture and taste of traditional fortune cookies while being safe for those with gluten intolerance.</p>

    <p>Here are some popular gluten-free fortune cookie brands:</p>
