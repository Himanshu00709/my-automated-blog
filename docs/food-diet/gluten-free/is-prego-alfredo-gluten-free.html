<h1>Is Prego Alfredo Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>When it comes to dietary restrictions, gluten-free diets have gained significant attention in recent years. Whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, many individuals are on the lookout for gluten-free food options. One popular product that often comes under scrutiny is Prego Alfredo sauce. In this article, we will delve into whether Prego Alfredo is gluten-free, explore its ingredients, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including damage to the small intestine. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten can cause discomfort and digestive problems. Therefore, it's crucial for those on a gluten-free diet to carefully examine food labels and ingredients.</p>

<h2>Is Prego Alfredo Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Prego Alfredo sauce is a creamy, rich sauce that many people enjoy with pasta, vegetables, or as a base for other dishes. To determine if Prego Alfredo is gluten-free, we need to look at its ingredients and manufacturing processes.</p>

<h3>Ingredients in Prego Alfredo Sauce</h3>

<p>The primary ingredients in Prego Alfredo sauce include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Cream</li>
    <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Modified Food Starch</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Natural Flavors</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, the devil is in the details. Modified food starch and natural flavors can sometimes be derived from gluten-containing sources. Therefore, it's essential to verify the source of these ingredients.</p>

<h3>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination</h3>

<p>Even if the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can be a concern. Many food production facilities handle multiple products, some of which may contain gluten. Cross-contamination can occur if the same equipment is used for both gluten-free and gluten-containing products without proper cleaning in between.</p>

<p>Prego, a brand under the Campbell Soup Company, has a reputation for transparency regarding allergens. According to their website, Prego Alfredo sauce is labeled as gluten-free, meaning it meets the FDA's standards for gluten-free products, which require that the product contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</p>
