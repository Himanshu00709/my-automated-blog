    <h2>Is Almond Paste Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>In its purest form, almond paste is gluten-free. The primary ingredients—almonds, sugar, and egg whites—are naturally free of gluten. However, the gluten-free status of almond paste can be compromised if it contains additives or is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing products. Cross-contamination is a significant concern for those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance.</p>

        <li><strong>Read the Ingredients:</strong> Avoid almond paste that lists ambiguous ingredients like “natural flavors” or “stabilizers,” which could contain gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact the Manufacturer:</strong> If you’re unsure, reach out to the manufacturer to confirm whether the product is processed in a gluten-free facility.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Your Own:</strong> Consider making almond paste at home using gluten-free ingredients. This gives you full control over what goes into your paste.</li>
    </ul>
