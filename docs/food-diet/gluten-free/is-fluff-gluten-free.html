One such food item that often raises questions is marshmallow fluff. Is fluff gluten-free? This article will delve into the details, providing you with a comprehensive guide to understanding whether marshmallow fluff is safe for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

The product gained popularity in the United States and has since become a staple in many households.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Gluten-Free Diets</h2>
