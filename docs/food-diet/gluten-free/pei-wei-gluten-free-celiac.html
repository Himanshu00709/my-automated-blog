    <h1>Pei Wei Gluten-Free Options for Celiac Patients</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. Cross-contamination, hidden gluten, and limited menu options can make eating out a stressful experience. However, Pei Wei, a popular Asian-inspired fast-casual restaurant, has made strides in accommodating gluten-free diets. In this article, we’ll explore Pei Wei’s gluten-free offerings, how they cater to celiac patients, and what you need to know to enjoy a safe and delicious meal.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Celiac Disease and Gluten Sensitivity</h2>
    <p>Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, triggers an immune response that can cause symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and long-term complications such as nutrient deficiencies and intestinal damage. Gluten sensitivity, while not an autoimmune condition, can also cause similar symptoms, making it essential for affected individuals to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Pei Wei’s Commitment to Gluten-Free Dining</h2>
    <p>Pei Wei has recognized the growing demand for gluten-free options and has taken steps to ensure that their menu is inclusive. They offer a variety of gluten-free dishes, from appetizers to main courses, and have implemented protocols to minimize cross-contamination. However, it’s important to note that Pei Wei’s kitchens are not entirely gluten-free, so there is always a risk of cross-contact.</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Menu Options at Pei Wei</h3>
    <p>Pei Wei’s gluten-free menu includes a range of dishes that cater to different tastes and preferences. Below is a table summarizing some of the popular gluten-free options available:</p>

However, individuals with severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease should communicate their dietary needs clearly to the staff and inquire about the restaurant’s current practices.</p>
