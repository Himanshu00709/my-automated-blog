    <h1>Is Yuca Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Yuca, also known as cassava, is a starchy root vegetable that has been a staple in many cultures for centuries. With the increasing prevalence of gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, many people are curious about whether yuca is a safe option. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of yuca, its nutritional benefits, and how it can be incorporated into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Yuca?</h2>

    <p>Yuca, or cassava, is a tropical root vegetable native to South America but widely cultivated in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. It is a versatile ingredient that can be boiled, fried, or mashed, and is often used as a substitute for potatoes. Yuca is rich in carbohydrates, making it an excellent source of energy, and it also contains essential vitamins and minerals such as vitamin C, folate, and potassium.</p>

    <h2>Is Yuca Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, yuca is naturally gluten-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. Since yuca is a root vegetable and not a grain, it does not contain gluten. This makes it a safe and nutritious option for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <p>However, it is important to note that while yuca itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during processing or preparation. For example, if yuca is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing products, there is a risk of cross-contamination. Therefore, it is crucial to read labels carefully and choose products that are certified gluten-free if you have a severe gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Yuca</h2>

    <p>Yuca is not only gluten-free but also packed with nutrients that can benefit your health. Below is a table summarizing the nutritional content of yuca per 100 grams:</p>
