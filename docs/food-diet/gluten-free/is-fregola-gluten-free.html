    <h1>Is Fregola Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Fregola, a traditional Sardinian pasta, has gained popularity in recent years due to its unique texture and versatility in dishes. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether fregola is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will delve into the composition of fregola, its gluten content, and explore gluten-free alternatives for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Fregola?</h2>

    <p>Fregola, also known as fregula, is a type of pasta that originates from the Italian island of Sardinia.
