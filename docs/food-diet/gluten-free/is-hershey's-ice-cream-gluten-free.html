For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize food labels and understand the potential sources of gluten in their diet.</p>
