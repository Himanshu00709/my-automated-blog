    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Tikka Masala</h2>

    <p>While many of the core ingredients in Tikka Masala are naturally gluten-free, there are a few potential sources of gluten that you need to be aware of:</p>

    <h3>1. Flour as a Thickener</h3>

    <p>Some recipes for Tikka Masala call for flour as a thickening agent for the sauce. Wheat flour, which contains gluten, is commonly used for this purpose. If you're preparing Tikka Masala at home, you can easily substitute wheat flour with a gluten-free alternative like cornstarch or rice flour.</p>

    <h3>2. Soy Sauce in Marinades</h3>

    <p>In some variations of Tikka Masala, soy sauce is used in the marinade to add depth of flavor. Traditional soy sauce contains wheat, making it a source of gluten. However, gluten-free soy sauce is available and can be used as a substitute.</p>

    <h3>3. Pre-Made Spice Mixes</h3>

    <p>Pre-made spice mixes or curry pastes may contain gluten as a filler or anti-caking agent. Always check the label or opt for whole spices that you grind yourself to ensure they are gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Tikka Masala</h2>

    <p>If you're preparing Tikka Masala at home and want to ensure it's gluten-free, follow these tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Gluten-Free Thickeners:</strong> Replace wheat flour with cornstarch, rice flour, or another gluten-free thickener.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Gluten-Free Soy Sauce:</strong> If your recipe calls for soy sauce, make sure to use a gluten-free version.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Spice Labels:</strong> Verify that any pre-made spice mixes or curry pastes are labeled gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Cross-Contamination:</strong> Ensure that all utensils, cookware, and surfaces are thoroughly cleaned to prevent cross-contamination with gluten-containing foods.</li>
    </ul>
