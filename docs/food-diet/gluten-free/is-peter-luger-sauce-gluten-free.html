<h1>Is Peter Luger Sauce Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>Peter Luger Steak House is renowned for its mouthwatering steaks and signature Peter Luger Sauce. This iconic sauce, often described as a blend of steak sauce and Worcestershire sauce, has become a staple for steak lovers worldwide. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Is Peter Luger Sauce gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, preparation, and alternatives to help you make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>What is Peter Luger Sauce?</h2>

<p>Peter Luger Sauce is a tangy, savory condiment that complements the rich flavors of steak. It’s a closely guarded recipe, but it’s widely believed to contain a mix of ingredients like tomato paste, vinegar, sugar, spices, and Worcestershire sauce. The sauce’s unique flavor profile has made it a favorite among steak enthusiasts, but its gluten content remains a concern for many.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It’s commonly present in sauces, dressings, and condiments due to the use of ingredients like soy sauce, malt vinegar, or thickeners. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems. Therefore, it’s crucial to scrutinize the ingredients of any sauce or condiment before consumption.</p>

<h2>Is Peter Luger Sauce Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, Peter Luger Sauce is <strong>not gluten-free</strong>. The primary reason is the inclusion of Worcestershire sauce, which typically contains malt vinegar derived from barley. Barley is a gluten-containing grain, making the sauce unsuitable for those avoiding gluten. Additionally, other ingredients in the sauce, such as soy sauce or certain thickeners, may also contain gluten.</p>
