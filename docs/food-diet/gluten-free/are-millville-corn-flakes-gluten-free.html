<h1>Are Millville Corn Flakes Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>When it comes to breakfast cereals, Millville Corn Flakes are a popular choice for many households. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether these corn flakes are gluten-free is of utmost importance. In this article, we will delve into the details of Millville Corn Flakes, their ingredients, and whether they are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including damage to the small intestine, nutrient malabsorption, and a host of other symptoms like fatigue, bloating, and joint pain. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, avoiding gluten is crucial to maintaining good health.</p>

<p>Given the prevalence of gluten in many processed foods, it's essential to scrutinize product labels carefully. This is especially true for breakfast cereals, which often contain hidden sources of gluten.</p>

<h2>Millville Corn Flakes: Ingredients and Nutritional Information</h2>

<p>Millville Corn Flakes are marketed as a simple, wholesome breakfast option. The primary ingredient is milled corn, which is naturally gluten-free. However, the presence of other ingredients and the risk of cross-contamination during manufacturing can complicate matters.</p>

<p>Here is a breakdown of the typical ingredients found in Millville Corn Flakes:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Ingredient</th>
            <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Milled Corn</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sugar</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Malt Flavoring</td>
            <td>No (contains barley)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Salt</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Vitamins and Minerals</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>As you can see, the inclusion of malt flavoring, which is derived from barley, makes Millville Corn Flakes unsuitable for a gluten-free diet. Barley is one of the primary sources of gluten, and even trace amounts can trigger symptoms in sensitive individuals.</p>

<h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

<p>Even if a product's ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can pose a risk. Many facilities process multiple products, some of which contain gluten. This can lead to the unintentional presence of gluten in otherwise gluten-free products.</p>

<p>Millville Corn Flakes are produced in facilities that also handle wheat and other gluten-containing grains. While the company may have protocols in place to minimize cross-contamination, the risk cannot be entirely eliminated. For individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, this is a significant concern.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Millville Corn Flakes</h2>

<p>If you're looking for a gluten-free alternative to Millville Corn Flakes, there are several options available on the market. Many brands offer corn flakes that are certified gluten-free, ensuring that they meet strict standards for gluten content and cross-contamination.</p>

<p>Here are some popular gluten-free corn flake brands:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Brand</th>
            <th>Certification</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Nature's Path</td>
            <td>Certified Gluten-Free</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Barbara's</td>
            <td>Certified Gluten-Free</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
