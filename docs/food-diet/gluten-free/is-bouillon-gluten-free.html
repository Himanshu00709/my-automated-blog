    <h1>Is Bouillon Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Bouillon, a staple in many kitchens, is a flavorful base for soups, stews, and sauces. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether bouillon is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore what bouillon is, its ingredients, and whether it’s safe for a gluten-free diet. We’ll also provide tips on how to choose gluten-free bouillon and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What is Bouillon?</h2>
    <p>Bouillon is a concentrated broth made by simmering meat, vegetables, and seasonings. It’s available in various forms, including cubes, granules, and liquid. Bouillon is used to enhance the flavor of dishes, and it’s a convenient way to add depth to your cooking without spending hours making broth from scratch.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It’s what gives dough its elasticity and helps it rise. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine.</p>
    <p>Gluten can hide in many processed foods, including bouillon. Ingredients like maltodextrin, hydrolyzed wheat protein, and modified food starch can all be sources of gluten. Therefore, it’s essential to read labels carefully when selecting bouillon products.</p>

    <h2>Is Bouillon Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>The answer to whether bouillon is gluten-free depends on the brand and the specific ingredients used. Some bouillon products are naturally gluten-free, while others may contain gluten-containing additives. Here’s a breakdown of what to look for:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Maltodextrin</td>
                <td>Depends</td>

            </tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Modified Food Starch</td>
                <td>Depends</td>

    <h2>How to Choose Gluten-Free Bouillon</h2>
    <p>When shopping for gluten-free bouillon, follow these tips to ensure you’re making a safe choice:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Read the Label:</strong> Look for products labeled "gluten-free." This indicates that the product meets the FDA’s standards for gluten-free foods, containing less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Certification:</strong> Some products carry certifications from organizations like the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO), which ensures stricter standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Ambiguous Ingredients:</strong> If you see ingredients like "hydrolyzed vegetable protein" or "modified food starch" without specifying the source, it’s best to avoid them unless the product is labeled gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Research Brands:</strong> Some brands are known for their gluten-free products. Look for brands that specialize in gluten-free foods or have a dedicated gluten-free line.</li>
    </ul>
