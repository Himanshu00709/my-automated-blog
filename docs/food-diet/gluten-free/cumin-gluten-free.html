    <h1>Cumin: A Gluten-Free Spice Powerhouse</h1>
    <p>Cumin, a spice that has been used for centuries in various cuisines around the world, is not only known for its distinctive flavor but also for its numerous health benefits. For those following a gluten-free diet, cumin is a safe and versatile option that can enhance the taste of your meals without compromising your dietary restrictions. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free nature of cumin, its health benefits, and how you can incorporate it into your gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Cumin?</h2>
