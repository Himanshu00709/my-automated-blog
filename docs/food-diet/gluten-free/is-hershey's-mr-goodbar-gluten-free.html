    <h1>Is Hershey's Mr. Goodbar Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of snacks and sweets can be a daunting task. One popular treat that often comes under scrutiny is Hershey's Mr. Goodbar. Known for its combination of milk chocolate and peanuts, Mr. Goodbar is a favorite among chocolate lovers. But is it safe for those who need to avoid gluten? In this article, we'll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential cross-contamination risks to determine whether Hershey's Mr. Goodbar is truly gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions. Therefore, it's crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and manufacturing processes of the foods they consume.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Hershey's Mr. Goodbar</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Hershey's Mr. Goodbar is gluten-free, we first need to examine its ingredients. According to the Hershey's website, the primary ingredients in Mr. Goodbar include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Milk Chocolate (Sugar, Cocoa Butter, Chocolate, Nonfat Milk, Milk Fat, Lactose, Soy Lecithin, PGPR, Emulsifier, Vanillin, Artificial Flavor)</li>
        <li>Peanuts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it's important to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process, which we'll explore in the next section.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if a product's ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can introduce gluten into the final product. This is particularly concerning for individuals with celiac disease, who must avoid even trace amounts of gluten.</p>

    <p>Hershey's has a comprehensive allergen control program in place to minimize the risk of cross-contamination. According to the company, they follow strict cleaning procedures and have dedicated production lines for certain products. However, Hershey's does not label Mr. Goodbar as "gluten-free," which suggests that there may still be a risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Is Hershey's Mr. Goodbar Certified Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Certification by a recognized gluten-free organization adds an extra layer of assurance for consumers. Unfortunately, Hershey's Mr. Goodbar is not certified gluten-free by any major gluten-free certification organization, such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). This lack of certification, combined with the absence of a "gluten-free" label on the packaging, means that individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity should exercise caution when consuming Mr. Goodbar.</p>

    <h2>Comparing Hershey's Mr. Goodbar with Other Gluten-Free Chocolate Bars</h2>

    <p>For those who need to avoid gluten, there are several chocolate bars on the market that are explicitly labeled as gluten-free. Below is a comparison table of Hershey's Mr. Goodbar with other popular gluten-free chocolate bars:</p>
