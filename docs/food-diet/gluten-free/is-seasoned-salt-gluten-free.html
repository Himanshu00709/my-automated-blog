    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Seasoned Salt</h2>

    <p>While many of the ingredients in seasoned salt are naturally gluten-free, there are some potential sources of gluten that you should be aware of:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If the seasoned salt is produced in a facility that also processes gluten-containing products, there is a risk of cross-contamination. This is particularly concerning for individuals with celiac disease, who must avoid even trace amounts of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Additives and Flavorings:</strong> Some seasoned salts may contain additives or flavorings that are derived from gluten-containing grains. For example, certain malt flavorings are made from barley, which contains gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Anti-Caking Agents:</strong> While most anti-caking agents are gluten-free, some may be derived from wheat or other gluten-containing grains. It's essential to check the label for any mention of wheat or gluten.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Ensure Your Seasoned Salt is Gluten-Free</h2>

    <p>If you're following a gluten-free diet, here are some steps you can take to ensure that your seasoned salt is safe:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Read the Label:</strong> Always check the ingredients list for any mention of wheat, barley, rye, or gluten. Look for a "gluten-free" certification on the packaging, which indicates that the product has been tested and meets gluten-free standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact the Manufacturer:</strong> If the label is unclear or if you have any doubts, contact the manufacturer directly to inquire about their gluten-free practices and whether the product is safe for individuals with celiac disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Certified Gluten-Free Brands:</strong> Opt for brands that are certified gluten-free by reputable organizations. These brands undergo rigorous testing to ensure that their products are free from gluten contamination.</li>
    </ol>
