<h1>Is KC Masterpiece Barbecue Sauce Gluten-Free?</h1>

<p>Barbecue sauce is a staple in many households, especially for those who love grilling and adding a tangy, smoky flavor to their dishes. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, it's crucial to know whether their favorite barbecue sauce contains gluten. One popular brand that often comes under scrutiny is KC Masterpiece. In this article, we'll dive deep into whether KC Masterpiece Barbecue Sauce is gluten-free, explore its ingredients, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it's essential for these individuals to carefully check the ingredients of any food product, including barbecue sauces, to ensure they are gluten-free.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in KC Masterpiece Barbecue Sauce</h2>

<p>To determine whether KC Masterpiece Barbecue Sauce is gluten-free, we need to examine its ingredients. The primary ingredients in KC Masterpiece Original Barbecue Sauce include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Tomato Puree (Water, Tomato Paste)</li>
    <li>High Fructose Corn Syrup</li>
    <li>Vinegar</li>
    <li>Molasses</li>
    <li>Modified Food Starch</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Spices</li>
    <li>Natural Smoke Flavor</li>
    <li>Caramel Color</li>
    <li>Garlic Powder</li>
    <li>Onion Powder</li>
    <li>Xanthan Gum</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, the term "modified food starch" can be a red flag for those avoiding gluten. Modified food starch can be derived from various sources, including corn, potatoes, or wheat. If the modified food starch is derived from wheat, it would contain gluten.</p>

<h2>Is KC Masterpiece Barbecue Sauce Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>According to the manufacturer, KC Masterpiece Barbecue Sauce does not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, the company does not explicitly label the product as "gluten-free." This means that while the ingredients themselves may not contain gluten, there is a possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process. Cross-contamination can occur if the sauce is produced in a facility that also processes gluten-containing products.</p>

<p>For individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, even trace amounts of gluten can cause adverse reactions. Therefore, it's essential to consider the risk of cross-contamination when deciding whether to consume KC Masterpiece Barbecue Sauce.</p>
