    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Pozole</h2>

    <p>While the core ingredients of pozole are gluten-free, there are several potential sources of gluten that you should be aware of:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-Seasoned or Marinated Meats:</strong> Some pre-packaged meats may contain gluten-based seasonings or marinades. Always check the label or ask the butcher.</li>
        <li><strong>Store-Bought Broth:</strong> Commercially prepared broths may use gluten as a thickening agent. Look for broths labeled "gluten-free."</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If pozole is prepared in a kitchen that also handles gluten-containing foods, there is a risk of cross-contamination. This is especially important in restaurants.</li>
        <li><strong>Tostadas and Tortillas:</strong> While corn-based tostadas and tortillas are gluten-free, wheat-based versions are not. Always confirm the type of tortilla being served.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Ensure Your Pozole is Gluten-Free</h2>

    <p>If you’re preparing pozole at home, you can easily ensure it’s gluten-free by following these tips:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Opt for fresh, unprocessed meats and vegetables. Avoid pre-seasoned or marinated meats unless they are labeled gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Your Own Broth:</strong> Homemade broth is the safest option. If using store-bought broth, choose one that is certified gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Seasonings:</strong> Ensure that all seasonings and spices are gluten-free. Some spice blends may contain gluten as an anti-caking agent.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Corn-Based Tostadas and Tortillas:</strong> Always choose corn-based products to avoid gluten. Double-check the packaging to confirm they are gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Cross-Contamination:</strong> Use separate utensils, cutting boards, and cookware when preparing gluten-free pozole.</li>
