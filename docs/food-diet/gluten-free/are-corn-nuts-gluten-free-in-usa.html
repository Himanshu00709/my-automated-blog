<h1>Are Corn Nuts Gluten-Free in the USA? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of snacks can be a daunting task. One popular snack that often comes into question is corn nuts. Are corn nuts gluten-free? This article will delve into the details, providing a comprehensive guide to understanding whether corn nuts are safe for those avoiding gluten in the USA.</p>

<h2>What Are Corn Nuts?</h2>

<p>Corn nuts are a crunchy snack made from whole corn kernels that have been roasted or deep-fried. They are known for their hard texture and savory flavor, often seasoned with various spices. Originating from South America, corn nuts have become a popular snack in the United States, enjoyed by many for their satisfying crunch and bold taste.</p>

<h2>Are Corn Nuts Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Corn itself is a gluten-free grain, which means that in its natural state, corn does not contain gluten. This is good news for those who need to avoid gluten, as it suggests that corn nuts could be a safe snack option. However, the processing and seasoning of corn nuts can introduce gluten into the final product.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten Contamination</h2>

<p>Gluten contamination can occur during the manufacturing process if the same equipment is used to process both gluten-containing and gluten-free products. Cross-contamination is a significant concern for individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, as even trace amounts of gluten can cause adverse reactions.</p>

<h2>Are Corn Nuts Gluten-Free in the USA?</h2>
