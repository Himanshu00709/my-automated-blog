    <p>As you can see, the ingredients listed in Cholula Taco Seasoning are naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that the term “natural flavors” can sometimes be ambiguous. While most natural flavors are gluten-free, there are rare cases where they may contain gluten-derived ingredients. Therefore, it’s always a good idea to check with the manufacturer if you have any doubts.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during the manufacturing process can introduce gluten into the product. Cross-contamination can occur if the seasoning is produced in a facility that also processes gluten-containing products.</p>

    <p>Cholula is known for its commitment to quality and safety. The company states that they follow strict manufacturing protocols to prevent cross-contamination. However, it’s always a good practice to look for a gluten-free certification on the packaging to ensure that the product meets the necessary standards.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free certification is a reliable way to ensure that a product is safe for those with gluten sensitivities. Certified gluten-free products have undergone rigorous testing and meet the standards set by organizations such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO).</p>

    <p>As of the latest information available, Cholula Taco Seasoning does not carry a gluten-free certification. However, based on the ingredients and manufacturing processes, it is considered gluten-free. If you require a certified gluten-free product, you may want to contact Cholula directly for more information or consider alternative brands that offer certified gluten-free taco seasonings.</p>
