    <h1>Are Mike's Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and the general trend toward healthier eating. Among the many brands that have entered the gluten-free market, Mike's has gained significant attention. But are Mike's products truly gluten-free? In this article, we will delve into the details, exploring the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications that determine whether Mike's products are safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to a host of health issues. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten can cause discomfort, bloating, and other digestive problems. As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to improve their health and well-being.</p>

    <p>When it comes to packaged foods, determining whether a product is gluten-free can be challenging. Cross-contamination during manufacturing, hidden gluten in ingredients, and misleading labeling can all pose risks. This is why it's crucial to thoroughly investigate the gluten-free status of any product, including those from Mike's.</p>

    <h2>Mike's Product Line: A Closer Look</h2>

    <p>Mike's offers a variety of products, including baked goods, snacks, and beverages. While some of their products are marketed as gluten-free, others may contain gluten or be at risk of cross-contamination. Below is a table summarizing the gluten-free status of some popular Mike's products:</p>
