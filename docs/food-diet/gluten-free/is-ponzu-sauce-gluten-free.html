<h1>Is Ponzu Sauce Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Ponzu sauce is a popular Japanese condiment known for its tangy, citrusy flavor. It is commonly used as a dipping sauce, marinade, or dressing. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, determining whether ponzu sauce is gluten-free is crucial. This article delves into the ingredients of ponzu sauce, its gluten content, and provides tips for selecting gluten-free options.</p>

<h2>What is Ponzu Sauce?</h2>

<p>Ponzu sauce is a versatile Japanese condiment made from a blend of citrus juice (usually yuzu, lemon, or lime), rice vinegar, soy sauce, and sometimes mirin or dashi. The result is a tangy, slightly sweet, and umami-rich sauce that complements a variety of dishes, from sushi to grilled meats.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Ponzu Sauce</h2>

    <li><strong>Check Ingredients:</strong> Ensure that the soy sauce used is gluten-free, such as tamari.</li>
