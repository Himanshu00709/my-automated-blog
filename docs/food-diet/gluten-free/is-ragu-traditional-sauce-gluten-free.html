<h1>Is Ragu Traditional Sauce Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Ragu is a beloved brand known for its rich and flavorful pasta sauces. For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, determining whether Ragu Traditional Sauce is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to help you make an informed decision about incorporating Ragu Traditional Sauce into your gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and long-term health complications. Therefore, it’s essential to scrutinize food labels and understand the potential sources of gluten in processed foods.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Ragu Traditional Sauce</h2>

<p>To determine if Ragu Traditional Sauce is gluten-free, let’s first examine its ingredients. The primary components of Ragu Traditional Sauce include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Tomato Puree</li>
    <li>Diced Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Onions</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Spices</li>
    <li>Natural Flavors</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, these ingredients appear to be gluten-free. However, it’s important to consider potential cross-contamination during manufacturing and the presence of hidden gluten in natural flavors or additives.</p>

<h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination</h2>

<p>Even if the ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during production can introduce gluten into the product. Ragu’s parent company, Mizkan America, has stated that they follow strict manufacturing protocols to minimize cross-contamination. However, they do not certify their Ragu Traditional Sauce as gluten-free. This means that while the sauce may not contain gluten ingredients, there is a risk of trace amounts due to shared equipment or facilities.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Certifications and Labels</h2>

<p>Gluten-free certifications provide an added layer of assurance for consumers. These certifications are granted by third-party organizations that test products for gluten content and verify that they meet strict gluten-free standards. Unfortunately, Ragu Traditional Sauce does not carry a gluten-free certification. This lack of certification means that individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease should exercise caution.</p>

<h2>Comparing Ragu Traditional Sauce with Gluten-Free Alternatives</h2>

<p>For those who need a guaranteed gluten-free option, there are several alternatives to Ragu Traditional Sauce. Below is a comparison table of Ragu Traditional Sauce and some popular gluten-free pasta sauces:</p>
