    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Shrimp Scampi</h2>

    <p>While many of the core ingredients in shrimp scampi are naturally gluten-free, there are a few potential sources of gluten that you need to be aware of:</p>

    <h3>1. Pasta</h3>

    <p>Traditional shrimp scampi is served over pasta, which is typically made from wheat flour and contains gluten. If you’re following a gluten-free diet, you’ll need to substitute regular pasta with a gluten-free alternative. There are many gluten-free pasta options available today, made from ingredients like rice, corn, quinoa, or legumes.</p>

    <h3>2. Flour for Thickening</h3>

    <p>Some recipes for shrimp scampi call for flour to thicken the sauce. If regular wheat flour is used, this will introduce gluten into the dish. To make the sauce gluten-free, you can use a gluten-free flour blend or a cornstarch slurry as a thickening agent.</p>

    <h3>3. Pre-Made Sauces or Seasonings</h3>

    <p>If you’re using a pre-made scampi sauce or seasoning mix, it’s essential to check the label for gluten-containing ingredients. Some sauces may contain thickeners, flavorings, or preservatives that include gluten. Always opt for sauces and seasonings that are labeled gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Shrimp Scampi</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free shrimp scampi at home is relatively simple, especially if you have the right ingredients on hand. Here’s a basic recipe to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
