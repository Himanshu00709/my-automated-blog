<h1>Does French Onion Dip Have Gluten? A Detailed Guide</h1>

In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients typically found in French onion dip, discuss gluten-free options, and provide tips for making your own gluten-free version at home.</p>

<h2>What is French Onion Dip?</h2>

<p>French onion dip is a creamy, savory dip made primarily from sour cream or yogurt, combined with caramelized onions, garlic, and various seasonings.
