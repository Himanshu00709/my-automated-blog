    <h1>Are Chi-Chi's Corn Tortillas Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding gluten-free products is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. One common question that arises is whether Chi-Chi's corn tortillas are gluten-free. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to provide a detailed answer to this question. We will also explore the nutritional aspects, potential cross-contamination risks, and offer some tips for safely incorporating Chi-Chi's corn tortillas into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to avoid gluten-containing foods and opt for gluten-free alternatives.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Chi-Chi's Corn Tortillas</h2>

    <p>Chi-Chi's corn tortillas are primarily made from corn masa flour, water, and a few other ingredients. Corn masa flour is naturally gluten-free, as it is derived from corn, which does not contain gluten. However, it is essential to examine the entire ingredient list to ensure there are no hidden sources of gluten. Here is a breakdown of the typical ingredients found in Chi-Chi's corn tortillas:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Corn Masa Flour</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Water</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lime</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cellulose Gum</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Propionic Acid</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Benzoic Acid</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As seen in the table above, all the primary ingredients in Chi-Chi's corn tortillas are gluten-free. However, it is always recommended to check the packaging for any updates or changes in the ingredient list, as formulations can vary over time.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>While the ingredients themselves may be gluten-free, cross-contamination during the manufacturing process can pose a risk for individuals with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Cross-contamination can occur if the same equipment is used to process both gluten-containing and gluten-free products. To minimize this risk, many manufacturers implement strict protocols to prevent cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>Chi-Chi's corn tortillas are produced in facilities that also handle wheat products. Although the company follows good manufacturing practices, there is always a possibility of cross-contamination. For individuals with celiac disease, it is advisable to look for products that are certified gluten-free by a recognized organization, such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO).</p>
