    <p>As you can see, most of the primary ingredients in salt water taffy are naturally gluten-free.

Therefore, it’s essential to look for salt water taffy brands that are certified gluten-free. These brands adhere to strict manufacturing processes to avoid cross-contamination and ensure their products are safe for those with gluten-related disorders.</p>
