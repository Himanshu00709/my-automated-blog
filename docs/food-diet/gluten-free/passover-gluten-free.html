    <h1>Passover Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Passover, or Pesach, is one of the most significant Jewish holidays, commemorating the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. During this time, Jewish families gather to celebrate with traditional meals, prayers, and rituals. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, Passover can present unique challenges. This guide will explore how to navigate Passover while maintaining a gluten-free lifestyle, offering tips, recipes, and insights to ensure a meaningful and delicious celebration.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Passover Dietary Restrictions</h2>

    <p>Passover dietary laws are among the most stringent in Jewish tradition. During the eight days of Passover, leavened foods (chametz) are strictly prohibited. This includes any food made from wheat, barley, rye, oats, or spelt that has been allowed to ferment and rise. Additionally, many Jewish communities also avoid kitniyot, which includes legumes, rice, and corn. For those who are gluten-free, these restrictions can be both a blessing and a challenge.</p>

    <p>On one hand, the prohibition of chametz naturally eliminates many gluten-containing foods. On the other hand, the avoidance of kitniyot can limit the availability of gluten-free alternatives. Understanding these restrictions is the first step in planning a gluten-free Passover.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Passover Foods</h2>

    <p>Fortunately, there are many naturally gluten-free foods that are perfect for Passover. Here are some staples to consider:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Food Category</th>
                <th>Examples</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Fruits and Vegetables</td>
                <td>Apples, carrots, potatoes, spinach, etc.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Proteins</td>
                <td>Beef, chicken, fish, eggs, etc.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Dairy</td>
                <td>Cheese, yogurt, milk (if not avoiding kitniyot)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Grains and Starches</td>
                <td>Quinoa (if accepted by your community), potato starch, almond flour</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Snacks</td>
                <td>Nuts, seeds, gluten-free matzah</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Passover Recipes</h2>

    <p>Creating a gluten-free Passover menu doesn't mean sacrificing flavor or tradition. Here are a few recipes to inspire your holiday meals:</p>
