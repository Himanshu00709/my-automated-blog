    <h1>Gluten-Free Shells: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular over the years, not only for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also for individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle. Among the many gluten-free alternatives available, gluten-free shells have gained significant attention. These versatile pasta options are not only delicious but also cater to a wide range of dietary needs. In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free shells, from their nutritional benefits to how to incorporate them into your meals.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Shells?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free shells are a type of pasta made without gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Traditional pasta is typically made from wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, gluten-free shells are crafted from alternative flours such as rice, corn, quinoa, or legumes like chickpeas and lentils. These ingredients provide a similar texture and taste to traditional pasta while being safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Shells</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free shells offer a variety of nutritional benefits, making them a great addition to any diet. Here are some key advantages:</p>

    <table>

            <tr>
                <th>Nutrient</th>
                <th>Benefit</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>High in Fiber</td>
                <td>Many gluten-free shells, especially those made from legumes, are high in dietary fiber, which aids in digestion and promotes gut health.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rich in Protein</td>
                <td>Legume-based gluten-free shells are an excellent source of plant-based protein, making them ideal for vegetarians and vegans.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Low Glycemic Index</td>
                <td>Gluten-free shells made from whole grains like quinoa or brown rice have a lower glycemic index, helping to regulate blood sugar levels.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
                <td>Naturally free from gluten, these shells are safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</td>

    <h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Shells</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free shells is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to keep in mind to ensure the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil Water:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Use plenty of water to prevent the shells from sticking together.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Shells:</strong> Once the water is boiling, add the gluten-free shells. Stir gently to prevent clumping.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Al Dente:</strong> Follow the package instructions for cooking time, but start checking the shells a minute or two before the recommended time. Gluten-free pasta can become mushy if overcooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Serve:</strong> Once the shells are cooked to your desired texture, drain them in a colander and rinse briefly with warm water to remove excess starch. Serve immediately with your favorite sauce or toppings.</li>
    </ol>
