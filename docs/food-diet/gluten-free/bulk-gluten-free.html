    <h2>Tips for Storing Bulk Gluten-Free Products</h2>

    <p>Proper storage is key to maintaining the quality and freshness of your bulk gluten-free products. Here are some tips to help you store your items effectively:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Airtight Containers:</strong> Airtight containers are essential for keeping moisture and pests out of your bulk items. Glass or BPA-free plastic containers with tight-fitting lids are ideal.</li>
        <li><strong>Label and Date:</strong> Always label your containers with the contents and the date of purchase. This will help you keep track of freshness and ensure you use older items first.</li>
        <li><strong>Store in a Cool, Dry Place:</strong> Most gluten-free grains and flours should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. For items like almond flour, refrigeration or freezing can extend shelf life.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotate Stock:</strong> Practice the "first in, first out" method to ensure that older items are used before newer ones. This helps prevent waste and ensures youâ€™re always using the freshest ingredients.</li>
    </ul>
