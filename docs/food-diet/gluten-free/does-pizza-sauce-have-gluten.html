    <h1>Does Pizza Sauce Have Gluten? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Pizza is one of the most beloved foods worldwide, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a slice can be a challenge. While the crust is often the primary concern, many people overlook the potential for gluten in pizza sauce. In this article, we’ll explore whether pizza sauce contains gluten, what ingredients to watch out for, and how to ensure your pizza sauce is gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Does It Matter?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It acts as a binding agent, giving dough its elasticity and helping it rise. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine.</p>

    <p>Given the potential health risks, it’s crucial for individuals with gluten-related disorders to scrutinize every component of their meals, including pizza sauce.</p>

    <h2>Common Ingredients in Pizza Sauce</h2>

    <p>Traditional pizza sauce is typically made from a few simple ingredients:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Tomatoes (crushed, pureed, or whole)</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Herbs (such as oregano, basil, and thyme)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, these ingredients are naturally gluten-free. However, the devil is in the details. Some pizza sauces may contain additives or thickeners that introduce gluten into the mix.</p>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Pizza Sauce</h2>

    <p>While the base ingredients of pizza sauce are gluten-free, there are several ways gluten can sneak into the sauce:</p>

    <table>

                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Potential Gluten Source</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Modified Food Starch</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein</td>
                <td>Used as a flavor enhancer, this is a direct source of gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Flour</td>
                <td>Sometimes added as a thickener, especially in creamy or roux-based sauces.</td>
