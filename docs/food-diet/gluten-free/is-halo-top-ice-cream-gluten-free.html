    <h1>Is Halo Top Ice Cream Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Halo Top ice cream has taken the dessert world by storm, offering a low-calorie, high-protein alternative to traditional ice cream.

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Does It Matter?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications.

Halo Top clearly labels their products, making it easier for consumers to identify which flavors are safe to eat.</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Certification</h3>

    <p>Halo Top ice cream is not certified gluten-free by a third-party organization. However, the company states that their products are made with gluten-free ingredients and are processed in a way that minimizes the risk of cross-contamination.
