<h1>Are Now and Later Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of snacks and candies can be a daunting task. One popular treat that often comes under scrutiny is the classic Now and Later candy. Known for its chewy texture and long-lasting flavor, Now and Later has been a favorite for generations. But the question remains: Are Now and Later gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential risks associated with Now and Later candies to determine whether they are safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial for individuals with these conditions to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and manufacturing processes of the foods they consume.</p>

<h2>Now and Later Ingredients Breakdown</h2>

<p>To determine whether Now and Later candies are gluten-free, we first need to examine their ingredients. The primary ingredients in Now and Later candies include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Corn Syrup</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Palm Oil</li>
    <li>Malic Acid</li>
    <li>Natural and Artificial Flavors</li>
    <li>Soy Lecithin</li>
    <li>Artificial Colors</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it’s important to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process. Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free products are produced in facilities that also process gluten-containing products.</p>

<h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

<p>Now and Later candies are manufactured by Ferrara Candy Company, a well-known confectionery company. Ferrara Candy Company has a reputation for producing a wide range of candies, some of which may contain gluten. This raises the question of whether Now and Later candies are produced on shared equipment or in facilities that also process gluten-containing products.</p>

<p>According to Ferrara Candy Company, they do not specifically label Now and Later candies as gluten-free. This lack of a gluten-free label suggests that there may be a risk of cross-contamination. For individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, even trace amounts of gluten can trigger symptoms, making it essential to avoid products that are not certified gluten-free.</p>

<h2>Are Now and Later Candies Safe for a Gluten-Free Diet?</h2>

<p>Based on the ingredient list, Now and Later candies do not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, the potential for cross-contamination during manufacturing means that they may not be safe for individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity. For those with mild gluten sensitivity or those who are avoiding gluten for other reasons, Now and Later candies may be considered safe in moderation, but it’s always best to consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns.</p>
