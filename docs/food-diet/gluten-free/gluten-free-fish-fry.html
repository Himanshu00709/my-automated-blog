    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Fish Fry</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create a mouthwatering gluten-free fish fry:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Fish</h3>
    <p>Start by selecting fresh fish fillets. Pat them dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture, which helps the coating stick better. Cut the fillets into manageable pieces if necessary.</p>

    <h3>2. Create the Coating</h3>
    <p>In a shallow bowl, mix your gluten-free flour or breadcrumbs with your chosen seasonings. For an extra layer of flavor, consider adding grated Parmesan cheese or crushed nuts to the mix.</p>

    <h3>3. Coat the Fish</h3>
    <p>Dip each fish fillet into a beaten egg or a gluten-free batter, then coat it evenly with the flour mixture. Press gently to ensure the coating adheres well.</p>

    <h3>4. Fry to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Heat your oil in a deep skillet or fryer to 350°F (175°C). Carefully place the coated fish fillets into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per side. Avoid overcrowding the pan to maintain an even temperature.</p>

    <h3>5. Drain and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the fish is cooked, transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil. Serve immediately with your favorite gluten-free sides, such as coleslaw, roasted vegetables, or a fresh salad.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Best Gluten-Free Fish Fry</h2>
    <p>Here are some expert tips to elevate your gluten-free fish fry:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a thermometer to monitor the oil temperature, as overheating can cause the coating to burn.</li>
        <li>Experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as chickpea flour or cornmeal, for unique textures and flavors.</li>
        <li>For a healthier option, try baking or air-frying the fish instead of deep-frying.</li>
        <li>Always check labels on pre-packaged ingredients to ensure they are certified gluten-free.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fish Fry</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use frozen fish for a gluten-free fish fry?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen fish, but make sure to thaw it completely and pat it dry before coating to prevent sogginess.</p>

        <h3>2. What are the best gluten-free flours for frying?</h3>
        <p>Rice flour, almond flour, and chickpea flour are excellent choices for a crispy, gluten-free coating.</p>

        <h3>3. How do I know if my oil is at the right temperature?</h3>
        <p>Use a kitchen thermometer to check if the oil has reached 350°F (175°C). Alternatively, you can test it by dropping a small piece of bread into the oil—if it sizzles and turns golden within 30 seconds, the oil is ready.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make gluten-free fish fry ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>While it’s best enjoyed fresh, you can reheat leftover fish fry in an oven or air fryer to restore its crispiness.</p>
    </div>
