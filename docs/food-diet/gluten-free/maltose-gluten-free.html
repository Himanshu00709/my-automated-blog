    <h1>Maltose and Gluten-Free Diets: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply choosing to avoid gluten, understanding the ingredients in their food is crucial. One such ingredient that often raises questions is maltose. Is maltose gluten-free? Can it be safely consumed on a gluten-free diet? In this article, we’ll explore the relationship between maltose and gluten, its sources, and how it fits into a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>What is Maltose?</h2>
