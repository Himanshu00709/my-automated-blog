<h1>Is Kraft Real Mayo Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>Mayonnaise is a staple in many households, used in sandwiches, salads, and various recipes. For individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, ensuring that their food is gluten-free is crucial. One popular brand that often comes into question is Kraft Real Mayo. In this article, we will explore whether Kraft Real Mayo is gluten-free, delve into its ingredients, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it is essential for these individuals to carefully scrutinize the ingredients of the foods they consume.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Kraft Real Mayo</h2>

<p>To determine whether Kraft Real Mayo is gluten-free, we need to examine its ingredients. The primary ingredients in Kraft Real Mayo include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Soybean oil</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Vinegar</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Lemon juice concentrate</li>
    <li>Natural flavors</li>
    <li>Calcium disodium EDTA (to protect quality)</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it's important to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process, especially if the product is produced in a facility that also processes gluten-containing foods.</p>

<h2>Is Kraft Real Mayo Certified Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Kraft Real Mayo is not certified gluten-free by any recognized gluten-free certification organization. However, Kraft Foods has stated that their mayonnaise products, including Kraft Real Mayo, do not contain gluten ingredients. This means that the product is inherently gluten-free based on its ingredient list, but it has not undergone the rigorous testing and certification process that some other products have.</p>

<h2>Cross-Contamination Concerns</h2>

<p>Cross-contamination is a significant concern for individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity. Even if a product does not contain gluten ingredients, it can still be contaminated with gluten if it is produced in a facility that also processes gluten-containing foods. Kraft Foods has not explicitly stated whether their mayonnaise is produced in a dedicated gluten-free facility. Therefore, there is a potential risk of cross-contamination, although it is likely minimal given the nature of the ingredients.</p>

<h2>Comparing Kraft Real Mayo to Other Brands</h2>

<p>When it comes to gluten-free mayonnaise, there are several brands on the market that offer certified gluten-free options. Below is a comparison table of Kraft Real Mayo with other popular mayonnaise brands:</p>
