    <h1>Are Buffalo Wild Wings Potato Wedges Gluten-Free?</h1>
    <p>Buffalo Wild Wings, often referred to as B-Dubs, is a popular restaurant chain known for its wide variety of wings, sauces, and sides. One of the most beloved sides on their menu is the potato wedges. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Are Buffalo Wild Wings potato wedges gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, preparation methods, and potential cross-contamination risks to provide a comprehensive answer.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial for those affected to be vigilant about the foods they consume, especially when dining out.</p>

    <h2>Buffalo Wild Wings Potato Wedges: Ingredients and Preparation</h2>
    <p>Buffalo Wild Wings potato wedges are made from whole potatoes that are cut into wedge shapes, seasoned, and then deep-fried. The primary ingredients in the potato wedges are potatoes, vegetable oil, and seasoning. At first glance, these ingredients seem gluten-free. However, the preparation process can introduce gluten into the equation.</p>

    <h3>Seasoning and Cross-Contamination</h3>
    <p>The seasoning used on the potato wedges is a critical factor in determining whether they are gluten-free. While the seasoning itself may not contain gluten, there is always a risk of cross-contamination. Cross-contamination can occur if the same fryer is used for gluten-containing items, such as breaded chicken wings or onion rings. Even trace amounts of gluten can be harmful to those with celiac disease.</p>

    <h3>Buffalo Wild Wings' Gluten-Free Policy</h3>
    <p>Buffalo Wild Wings has made efforts to accommodate customers with gluten sensitivities. They offer a gluten-free menu that includes items specifically prepared to minimize the risk of cross-contamination. However, it’s important to note that their kitchen is not entirely gluten-free, and cross-contamination is still a possibility.</p>

    <h2>Are Buffalo Wild Wings Potato Wedges Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Based on the information provided by Buffalo Wild Wings, their potato wedges are not listed as gluten-free on their official gluten-free menu. This suggests that there may be a risk of gluten contamination, either through the seasoning or the frying process. Therefore, individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity should exercise caution when considering ordering the potato wedges.</p>

    <h2>Alternatives for Gluten-Free Diners</h2>
    <p>If you’re looking for gluten-free options at Buffalo Wild Wings, there are several alternatives to consider. The restaurant offers a variety of sides and appetizers that are listed as gluten-free, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Celery and Carrot Sticks</li>
        <li>Side Salad (without croutons)</li>
        <li>Fresh-Cut Fries (cooked in a dedicated fryer)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It’s always a good idea to inform your server about your dietary restrictions so they can take extra precautions to avoid cross-contamination.</p>
