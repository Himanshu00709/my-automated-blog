    <h1>Gluten-Free Tostadas: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the desire for healthier eating habits. Among the many gluten-free dishes gaining popularity, tostadas stand out as a versatile and flavorful option. Whether you're a seasoned gluten-free eater or just exploring this dietary lifestyle, gluten-free tostadas offer a delightful way to enjoy Mexican cuisine without compromising on taste or health.</p>

    <h2>What Are Tostadas?</h2>
    <p>Tostadas are a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a crispy fried or baked tortilla topped with a variety of ingredients such as beans, meat, cheese, lettuce, and salsa. The word "tostada" literally means "toasted" in Spanish, referring to the crispy texture of the tortilla base. While traditional tostadas are made with corn tortillas, which are naturally gluten-free, some variations use flour tortillas, which contain gluten. For those avoiding gluten, it's essential to ensure that all ingredients, including the tortillas, are gluten-free.</p>

Corn tortillas, the base of gluten-free tostadas, are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They are also lower in calories and fat compared to flour tortillas. Additionally, gluten-free tostadas can be customized with a wide range of toppings, making them a versatile and satisfying meal option.</p>
