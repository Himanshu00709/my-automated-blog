<h1>Are Cosmic Brownies Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>Cosmic Brownies, those iconic, fudgy, rainbow-sprinkled treats, have been a staple in lunchboxes and snack drawers for decades. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Are Cosmic Brownies gluten-free? In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and alternatives to help you make an informed decision about enjoying these beloved snacks.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial to know whether your favorite snacks, like Cosmic Brownies, contain gluten.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Cosmic Brownies</h2>

<p>To determine if Cosmic Brownies are gluten-free, we need to examine their ingredients. The primary ingredients in Cosmic Brownies include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Corn Syrup</li>
    <li>Enriched Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid)</li>
    <li>Palm Oil</li>
    <li>Cocoa</li>
    <li>High Fructose Corn Syrup</li>
    <li>Soybean Oil</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Artificial Flavors</li>
    <li>Rainbow Sprinkles</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, <strong>enriched wheat flour</strong> is a key ingredient in Cosmic Brownies. This means that traditional Cosmic Brownies are <strong>not gluten-free</strong>.</p>

<h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination</h2>

<p>Even if a product doesn’t contain gluten-containing ingredients, cross-contamination during manufacturing can be a concern. Cosmic Brownies are produced in facilities that also process other products containing gluten. This increases the risk of cross-contamination, making them unsuitable for those with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>

<p>If you’re craving the rich, chocolatey goodness of Cosmic Brownies but need a gluten-free option, there are several alternatives available:</p>

        <tr>
            <th>Brand</th>
