    <p>From the table above, it’s clear that the primary ingredients in Lays Cheddar and Sour Cream chips are gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that while the ingredients themselves may be gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing could still pose a risk.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients in a product are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can introduce gluten into the final product. This is particularly concerning for individuals with celiac disease, who must avoid even trace amounts of gluten.</p>

    <p>Frito-Lay, the manufacturer of Lays chips, has a dedicated gluten-free product line. However, Lays Cheddar and Sour Cream chips are not part of this line. According to Frito-Lay, their gluten-free products are manufactured in facilities that do not process gluten-containing ingredients. However, Lays Cheddar and Sour Cream chips are produced in facilities that also process gluten-containing products, which increases the risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Frito-Lay’s Gluten-Free Policy</h2>

    <p>Frito-Lay provides a list of products that are considered gluten-free based on the FDA’s definition of less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. Unfortunately, Lays Cheddar and Sour Cream chips are not included in this list. This means that while the ingredients may be gluten-free, the product is not certified gluten-free by Frito-Lay.</p>
