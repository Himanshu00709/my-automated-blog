    <h1>Does Phyllo Pastry Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Phyllo pastry, also known as filo pastry, is a staple in many cuisines, particularly in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern dishes. Its thin, flaky layers make it a versatile ingredient for both sweet and savory recipes. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding whether phyllo pastry contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we will explore the composition of phyllo pastry, its gluten content, and alternatives for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Phyllo Pastry?</h2>

    <p>Phyllo pastry is a type of dough that is rolled and stretched into extremely thin sheets. These sheets are then layered with butter or oil to create a flaky, crispy texture when baked. It is commonly used in dishes like baklava, spanakopita, and börek. The process of making phyllo pastry is labor-intensive, requiring skill and precision to achieve the desired thinness.</p>

    <h2>Does Phyllo Pastry Contain Gluten?</h2>

    <p>Yes, traditional phyllo pastry contains gluten. The primary ingredient in phyllo dough is wheat flour, which is a significant source of gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye that gives dough its elasticity and helps it rise. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and skin problems.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients in Traditional Phyllo Pastry</h3>

            <tr>
