<h2>Is Massaman Curry Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>The gluten-free status of Massaman curry largely depends on the curry paste used in its preparation. While many of the primary ingredients, such as coconut milk, meat, and vegetables, are naturally gluten-free, the curry paste can be a potential source of gluten. Some commercial curry pastes may contain wheat or other gluten-containing additives as thickeners or flavor enhancers.</p>

<p>Additionally, fish sauce, a common ingredient in Massaman curry, can sometimes contain gluten. While traditional fish sauce is made from fermented fish and salt, some brands may add wheat-based ingredients to enhance flavor or texture. Therefore, it's crucial to check the labels of both the curry paste and fish sauce to ensure they are gluten-free.</p>
