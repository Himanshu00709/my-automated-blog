    <h1>Is Vegetable Broth Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Vegetable broth is a staple in many kitchens, especially for those who follow plant-based diets or are looking for a flavorful base for soups, stews, and sauces. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether vegetable broth is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of vegetable broth, what to look for when purchasing it, and how to make your own gluten-free version at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Vegetable Broth?</h2>

    <h2>How to Choose Gluten-Free Vegetable Broth</h2>

    <p>When shopping for vegetable broth, here are some tips to ensure you're selecting a gluten-free product:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Read the Label:</strong> Look for products that are labeled "gluten-free." This certification ensures that the product contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Ambiguous Ingredients:</strong> Ingredients like yeast extract, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, and malt extract can sometimes contain gluten. If you're unsure, contact the manufacturer for clarification.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Cross-Contamination:</strong> Some brands may process their vegetable broth in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products. Look for labels that indicate the product is made in a dedicated gluten-free facility.</li>
    </ul>
