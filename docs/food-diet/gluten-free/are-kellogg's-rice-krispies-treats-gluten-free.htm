    <h1>Are Kellogg's Rice Krispies Treats Gluten-Free?</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of snacks can be a daunting task. One popular treat that often comes into question is Kellogg's Rice Krispies Treats. These chewy, marshmallow-filled bars are a favorite among kids and adults alike, but are they safe for those who need to avoid gluten? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and alternatives to help you make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even small amounts of gluten can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. For those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, the symptoms may be less severe but still uncomfortable. Therefore, it’s crucial to know whether a product contains gluten or is processed in a facility that handles gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Kellogg's Rice Krispies Treats</h2>

    <p>The primary ingredients in Kellogg's Rice Krispies Treats include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Rice Krispies Cereal (rice, sugar, salt, malt flavoring)</li>
        <li>Marshmallows (corn syrup, sugar, gelatin, natural and artificial flavor)</li>
        <li>Margarine (soybean oil, hydrogenated soybean oil, water, salt, soy lecithin, mono and diglycerides, artificial flavor, vitamin A palmitate, beta carotene)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, the ingredients seem gluten-free. However, the devil is in the details. The malt flavoring in Rice Krispies Cereal is derived from barley, which contains gluten. This makes the cereal itself unsuitable for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if a product’s ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can pose a risk. Kellogg's has stated that their Rice Krispies Treats are made in facilities that also process wheat and other gluten-containing ingredients. This increases the likelihood of cross-contamination, making the product unsafe for those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Rice Krispies Treats</h2>

    <p>If you’re craving the taste of Rice Krispies Treats but need to avoid gluten, there are several alternatives available:</p>

                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>

    </table>
