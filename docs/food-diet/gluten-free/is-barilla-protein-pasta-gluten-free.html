    <h1>Is Barilla Protein Pasta Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Pasta lovers who are health-conscious or have dietary restrictions often seek alternatives to traditional wheat-based pasta. Barilla, a well-known brand in the pasta industry, has introduced a line of protein-enriched pasta that has garnered significant attention. But is Barilla Protein Pasta gluten-free? This article delves into the details, providing a comprehensive analysis of the ingredients, nutritional benefits, and suitability for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Barilla Protein Pasta</h2>

    <p>Barilla Protein Pasta is a product designed to cater to individuals looking to increase their protein intake without compromising on taste or texture. Unlike traditional pasta, which is primarily made from durum wheat semolina, Barilla Protein Pasta incorporates a blend of ingredients to boost its protein content. The primary ingredients include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Durum wheat semolina</li>
        <li>Lentil flour</li>
        <li>Chickpea flour</li>
