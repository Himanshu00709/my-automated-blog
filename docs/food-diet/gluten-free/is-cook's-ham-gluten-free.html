    <p>When it comes to dietary restrictions, gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular due to the rise in gluten intolerance and celiac disease. For those who follow a gluten-free lifestyle, understanding which foods are safe to consume is crucial. One common question that arises is: <strong>Is Cook's Ham gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we will delve into the details of Cook's Ham, its ingredients, and whether it is safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications.

According to the manufacturer, Cook's Ham does not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, it is always important to read the label and check for any potential cross-contamination risks, especially if the product is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing foods.</p>
