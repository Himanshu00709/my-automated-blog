    <h1>Is Kraft Marshmallow Creme Gluten-Free?</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, determining whether a product is gluten-free is crucial. Kraft Marshmallow Creme is a popular ingredient in many desserts, but is it safe for those who need to avoid gluten? In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential risks associated with Kraft Marshmallow Creme to help you make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it’s essential to carefully scrutinize food labels and understand the potential sources of gluten in processed foods.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Kraft Marshmallow Creme</h2>
    <p>To determine if Kraft Marshmallow Creme is gluten-free, let’s first look at its ingredients. According to the product label, the primary ingredients include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Corn syrup</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Dried egg whites</li>
        <li>Artificial flavor</li>
        <li>Xanthan gum</li>
    </ul>
    <p>None of these ingredients inherently contain gluten. However, the absence of gluten-containing ingredients doesn’t automatically guarantee that the product is gluten-free. Cross-contamination during manufacturing can also be a concern.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>
    <p>Even if a product’s ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. This happens when gluten-free products are processed on the same equipment or in the same facility as gluten-containing products. Kraft Foods, the manufacturer of Kraft Marshmallow Creme, does not explicitly state that the product is processed in a gluten-free facility. However, they do provide allergen information on their packaging, which can help consumers make informed choices.</p>

    <h2>Kraft’s Stance on Gluten-Free Products</h2>
    <p>Kraft Foods has a history of providing clear allergen information on their products. While they do not label Kraft Marshmallow Creme as “gluten-free,” they do not list any gluten-containing ingredients either. This suggests that the product is likely safe for those with gluten sensitivities, but it’s always best to check the packaging for the most up-to-date information.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Kraft Marshmallow Creme</h2>
    <p>If you’re looking for a guaranteed gluten-free marshmallow creme, there are several alternatives available on the market. Some brands specifically label their products as gluten-free, providing an extra layer of assurance for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Here are a few options:</p>
