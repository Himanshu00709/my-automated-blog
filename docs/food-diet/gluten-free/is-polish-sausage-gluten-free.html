<h1>Is Polish Sausage Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Polish sausage, also known as kielbasa, is a beloved staple in many households. Its rich flavor and versatility make it a popular choice for meals, whether grilled, fried, or added to stews. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Polish sausage is gluten-free is of paramount importance.

<h2>What is Polish Sausage?</h2>

<p>Polish sausage, or kielbasa, is a type of sausage that originated in Poland.
