    <h1>Is PAM Original Cooking Spray Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>When it comes to cooking, especially for those with dietary restrictions, knowing the ingredients in your kitchen staples is crucial. One common question that arises is whether PAM Original Cooking Spray is gluten-free. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to provide a comprehensive answer to this question.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it’s essential for those with gluten-related disorders to ensure that the products they use are free from gluten contamination.</p>

    <h2>What is PAM Original Cooking Spray?</h2>

    <p>PAM Original Cooking Spray is a popular kitchen product used to prevent food from sticking to cookware. It’s made from a blend of oils, lecithin (an emulsifier), and propellant. The spray is known for its convenience and effectiveness in reducing the need for additional fats like butter or oil.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in PAM Original Cooking Spray</h2>

    <p>To determine if PAM Original Cooking Spray is gluten-free, let’s first look at its ingredients:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Canola Oil</td>
                <td>Primary cooking oil</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lecithin</td>
                <td>Emulsifier</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Propellant</td>
                <td>Helps in spraying</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As seen in the table above, the primary ingredients in PAM Original Cooking Spray are gluten-free. However, it’s also important to consider the manufacturing process and potential cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can introduce gluten into the product. PAM is produced by Conagra Brands, a company that takes food safety seriously. According to Conagra Brands, PAM Original Cooking Spray is manufactured in facilities that handle gluten-containing products, but they have strict protocols in place to prevent cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>Conagra Brands also states that PAM Original Cooking Spray is labeled as gluten-free, which means it meets the FDA’s standards for gluten-free products. The FDA requires that products labeled as gluten-free contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, a level considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Certifications and Labels</h2>

    <p>While PAM Original Cooking Spray is labeled as gluten-free, it’s important to note that it does not carry a certified gluten-free label from organizations like the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). However, the FDA’s gluten-free labeling is a reliable indicator that the product is safe for those with gluten-related disorders.</p>
