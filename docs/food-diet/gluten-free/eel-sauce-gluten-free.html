    <h1>Eel Sauce Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Eel sauce, also known as unagi sauce, is a thick, sweet, and savory condiment commonly used in Japanese cuisine. Traditionally, it is made from soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and sometimes sake.

This article delves into the world of gluten-free eel sauce, exploring its ingredients, preparation, and alternatives, ensuring that everyone can enjoy this delicious sauce without compromising their health.</p>

    <h2>What is Eel Sauce?</h2>

Fortunately, there are gluten-free alternatives that allow everyone to enjoy the rich flavors of eel sauce without the adverse effects.</p>
