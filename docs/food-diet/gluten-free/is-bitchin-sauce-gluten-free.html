This certification means that the product has been rigorously tested and meets the strict standards for gluten-free products, containing less than 10 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</p>

    <p>Here's a table summarizing the gluten-free status of Bitchin' Sauce:</p>

    <table>

            <tr>
                <th>Feature</th>
                <th>Details</th>
            </tr>

        <tbody>
            <tr>
