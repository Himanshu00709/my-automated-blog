<h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Hollandaise Sauce</h2>

<p>While the basic ingredients of hollandaise sauce are gluten-free, there are a few scenarios where gluten might sneak in:</p>

<h3>1. Pre-Made or Packaged Hollandaise Sauce</h3>

<p>Store-bought or pre-made hollandaise sauces may contain additives, thickeners, or preservatives that include gluten. Always check the label for ingredients like wheat starch, modified food starch, or malt vinegar, which are common sources of gluten.</p>

<h3>2. Cross-Contamination</h3>

<p>If hollandaise sauce is prepared in a kitchen that also handles gluten-containing foods, there’s a risk of cross-contamination. This is especially important for individuals with celiac disease, as even trace amounts of gluten can cause a reaction.</p>

<h3>3. Restaurant Preparations</h3>

<p>When dining out, it’s essential to ask how the hollandaise sauce is prepared. Some restaurants may use pre-made mixes or add ingredients that contain gluten. Always communicate your dietary needs to the staff to ensure your meal is safe.</p>

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Hollandaise Sauce at Home</h2>

<p>Making hollandaise sauce at home is the best way to ensure it’s gluten-free. Here’s a simple recipe:</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>

    <li>Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler) and continue whisking until the mixture thickens slightly.</li>
    <li>Slowly drizzle in the melted butter while whisking constantly until the sauce is thick and creamy.</li>
    <li>Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately or keep warm until ready to use.</li>
</ol>

<p>By making your own hollandaise sauce, you can control the ingredients and avoid any potential sources of gluten.</p>
