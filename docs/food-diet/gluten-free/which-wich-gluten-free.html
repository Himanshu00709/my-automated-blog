    <h1>Which Wich Gluten-Free Options: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding safe and delicious dining options can be a challenge. Which Wich, a popular sandwich chain, has made strides in catering to gluten-free diets. In this article, we’ll explore Which Wich’s gluten-free offerings, how they ensure safety, and what you need to know before ordering. Whether you’re a seasoned gluten-free eater or new to the lifestyle, this guide will help you navigate the menu with confidence.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. A gluten-free diet eliminates these grains and any products derived from them. While many restaurants now offer gluten-free options, cross-contamination remains a significant concern. Which Wich has taken steps to address this, making it a viable option for gluten-free diners.</p>

    <h2>Which Wich’s Gluten-Free Menu</h2>

    <p>Which Wich offers a variety of gluten-free options, including sandwiches, salads, and sides. Their gluten-free bread is a standout, allowing customers to enjoy classic sandwich combinations without the worry of gluten. Below is a breakdown of their gluten-free offerings:</p>
