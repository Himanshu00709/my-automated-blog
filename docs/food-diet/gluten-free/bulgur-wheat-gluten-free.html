<h1>Is Bulgur Wheat Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Bulgur wheat has been a staple in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines for centuries. Known for its nutty flavor and versatility, it’s a popular ingredient in dishes like tabbouleh, pilafs, and salads. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, many people are questioning whether bulgur wheat is safe to consume. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten content of bulgur wheat, its nutritional profile, and alternatives for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>What is Bulgur Wheat?</h2>

<p>Bulgur wheat is a whole grain made from cracked and parboiled wheat kernels. It’s a minimally processed food that retains most of its nutrients, including fiber, protein, and essential vitamins and minerals. Bulgur is often confused with cracked wheat, but the key difference lies in the parboiling process, which gives bulgur its unique texture and shorter cooking time.</p>
