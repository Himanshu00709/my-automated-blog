    <h1>Is Lavash Bread Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Lavash bread, a traditional flatbread with roots in Armenian, Iranian, and Turkish cuisines, has gained popularity worldwide due to its versatility and delicious taste. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether lavash bread is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will explore the composition of lavash bread, its gluten content, and alternatives for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Lavash Bread?</h2>

    <p>Lavash bread is a thin, soft flatbread that is traditionally baked in a tandoor or on a griddle. It is made from simple ingredients such as flour, water, and salt. The dough is rolled out thinly and then baked at high temperatures, resulting in a bread that is both pliable and slightly crispy. Lavash bread is often used as a wrap for sandwiches, a base for pizzas, or simply enjoyed with dips and spreads.</p>

    <h2>Is Lavash Bread Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Traditional lavash bread is made from wheat flour, which contains gluten. Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye that gives bread its elasticity and chewy texture. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and skin rashes.</p>

    <p>Therefore, traditional lavash bread is not gluten-free. However, there are gluten-free alternatives available that use flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or a blend of gluten-free flours to mimic the texture and taste of traditional lavash bread.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Lavash Bread Alternatives</h2>

    <p>For those who need to avoid gluten, there are several gluten-free lavash bread options available on the market. These alternatives are made using gluten-free flours and are often fortified with additional nutrients to compensate for the lack of gluten. Here are some popular gluten-free lavash bread options:</p>
