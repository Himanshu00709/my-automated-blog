<h1>Is C&H Powdered Sugar Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, understanding whether a product contains gluten is crucial. One common question that arises is whether C&H powdered sugar is gluten-free. In this article, we will delve into the details of C&H powdered sugar, its ingredients, and whether it is safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

<h2>What is C&H Powdered Sugar?</h2>

<p>C&H powdered sugar, also known as confectioners' sugar or icing sugar, is a finely ground sugar mixed with a small amount of cornstarch to prevent clumping. It is widely used in baking and dessert recipes to create smooth icings, frostings, and dustings. C&H is a well-known brand that has been trusted by bakers for decades.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is responsible for the elastic texture of dough and is commonly found in bread, pasta, and baked goods. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and long-term complications.</p>

<p>When it comes to sugar, pure sugar itself is naturally gluten-free. However, the concern arises with additives or processing agents that may be used during production. In the case of powdered sugar, the addition of cornstarch or other anti-caking agents could potentially introduce gluten if not sourced carefully.</p>

<h2>Is C&H Powdered Sugar Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>According to the manufacturer, C&H powdered sugar is gluten-free. The primary ingredients in C&H powdered sugar are sugar and cornstarch. Cornstarch is naturally gluten-free, and C&H ensures that their products are free from gluten-containing ingredients. Additionally, C&H follows strict manufacturing processes to prevent cross-contamination with gluten-containing products.</p>

<p>However, it is always important to check the packaging for any allergen statements or certifications. Some brands may change their formulations or manufacturing processes, so staying informed is key.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in C&H Powdered Sugar</h2>

<p>Let's take a closer look at the ingredients in C&H powdered sugar:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Ingredient</th>
            <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Sugar</td>
            <td>Gluten-Free</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cornstarch</td>
            <td>Gluten-Free</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>As shown in the table, both sugar and cornstarch are gluten-free. This makes C&H powdered sugar a safe option for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

<h2>Cross-Contamination Concerns</h2>

<p>While the ingredients in C&H powdered sugar are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing if the product is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing products. C&H has stated that they take precautions to prevent cross-contamination, but if you have severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, it is always a good idea to contact the manufacturer directly for the most up-to-date information.</p>
