    <h2>Health Benefits of Fennel</h2>
    <p>Fennel offers a wide range of health benefits, particularly for those following a gluten-free diet. Here are some of the most notable advantages:</p>

    <h3>1. Supports Digestive Health</h3>
    <p>Fennel is renowned for its digestive properties. It contains anethole, a compound that helps relax the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, reducing bloating, gas, and cramping. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, fennel can be particularly beneficial in managing symptoms like abdominal discomfort and irregular bowel movements.</p>

    <h3>2. Rich in Antioxidants</h3>
    <p>Fennel is loaded with antioxidants, including vitamin C and flavonoids, which help combat oxidative stress and inflammation. These properties are especially important for individuals with gluten-related disorders, as chronic inflammation is a common issue.</p>

    <h3>3. Promotes Heart Health</h3>
    <p>The high potassium content in fennel helps regulate blood pressure, while its fiber content aids in lowering cholesterol levels. Both of these factors contribute to improved cardiovascular health, which is crucial for overall well-being.</p>

    <h3>4. Boosts Immune Function</h3>
    <p>With its significant vitamin C content, fennel supports the immune system, helping the body fight off infections and illnesses. This is particularly important for individuals with celiac disease, as they may have compromised immune function.</p>

    <h3>2. Fennel Tea</h3>
    <p>Fennel seeds can be used to make a soothing tea that aids digestion. Steep 1 teaspoon of crushed fennel seeds in hot water for 5-10 minutes, strain, and enjoy. This is a great option for those looking to alleviate digestive discomfort.</p>

    <h3>3. Fennel in Soups and Stews</h3>
    <p>Add chopped fennel bulb to your favorite gluten-free soups and stews for an extra layer of flavor and nutrition. It pairs well with ingredients like carrots, potatoes, and lentils.</p>

    <h3>4. Fennel Seed Seasoning</h3>
