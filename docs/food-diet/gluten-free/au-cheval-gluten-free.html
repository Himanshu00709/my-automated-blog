    <h1>Au Cheval Gluten-Free: A Culinary Delight for Everyone</h1>

    <p>In the world of gourmet burgers, Au Cheval has carved out a niche for itself as a destination for those seeking the ultimate burger experience. Known for its decadent, over-the-top creations, Au Cheval has become a must-visit spot for food enthusiasts. But what about those who follow a gluten-free diet? Can they still indulge in the culinary magic that Au Cheval offers? The answer is a resounding yes! In this blog post, we’ll explore the gluten-free options at Au Cheval, how they cater to dietary restrictions, and why this iconic eatery continues to be a favorite among gluten-free diners.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining</h2>

    <p>Before diving into Au Cheval’s gluten-free offerings, it’s important to understand what gluten-free dining entails. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. For these individuals, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues, fatigue, and other health problems. As a result, many restaurants have started to offer gluten-free options to cater to this growing demographic.</p>

    <p>Au Cheval has embraced this trend by offering a variety of gluten-free options, ensuring that everyone can enjoy their delicious burgers without compromising their health. Let’s take a closer look at what they have to offer.</p>

    <h2>Au Cheval’s Gluten-Free Menu</h2>

    <p>Au Cheval’s menu is a testament to their commitment to quality and inclusivity. While their signature burgers are typically served on a brioche bun, they offer gluten-free buns as an alternative. This simple substitution allows gluten-free diners to enjoy the same mouthwatering burgers that have made Au Cheval famous.</p>

    <p>Here’s a breakdown of some of the gluten-free options available at Au Cheval:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Menu Item</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Option</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Single Cheeseburger</td>
                <td>A classic burger with two beef patties, American cheese, and Dijon mustard.</td>
                <td>Available with a gluten-free bun.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Double Cheeseburger</td>
                <td>For those with a bigger appetite, this burger features four beef patties, double cheese, and all the fixings.</td>
                <td>Available with a gluten-free bun.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Fried Chicken Sandwich</td>
                <td>A crispy fried chicken breast topped with pickles and hot sauce.</td>
                <td>Available with a gluten-free bun and gluten-free breading.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Side Dishes</td>
                <td>Options include fries, hash browns, and salads.</td>
                <td>All naturally gluten-free.</td>
            </tr>
