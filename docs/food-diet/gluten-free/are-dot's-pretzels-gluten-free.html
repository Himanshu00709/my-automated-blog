    <h1>Are Dot's Pretzels Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Dot's Pretzels have taken the snack world by storm with their unique flavor and satisfying crunch. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question remains: Are Dot's Pretzels gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and alternatives to help you make an informed decision about whether Dot's Pretzels are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial for those on a gluten-free diet to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and manufacturing processes of the foods they consume.</p>

    <h2>Dot's Pretzels: Ingredients and Manufacturing</h2>

    <p>Dot's Pretzels are known for their bold flavors and addictive crunch. However, the primary ingredient in Dot's Pretzels is wheat flour, which contains gluten. This means that traditional Dot's Pretzels are not gluten-free. Let’s take a closer look at the ingredients:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Contains Gluten?</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Wheat Flour</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vegetable Oil</td>
                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Yeast</td>
                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Malt Extract</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As you can see, the presence of wheat flour and malt extract makes Dot's Pretzels unsuitable for those on a gluten-free diet. Additionally, the manufacturing process may involve cross-contamination with gluten-containing products, further increasing the risk for those with severe gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>Are There Gluten-Free Alternatives to Dot's Pretzels?</h2>
