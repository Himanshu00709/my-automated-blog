<h1>Is Teriyaki Chicken Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>Teriyaki chicken is a beloved dish that combines the savory flavors of soy sauce, sugar, and mirin to create a sweet and tangy glaze. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether teriyaki chicken is gluten-free is a critical one. In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients typically used in teriyaki sauce, discuss gluten-free alternatives, and provide tips for enjoying this dish safely.</p>

<h2>What is Teriyaki Sauce Made Of?</h2>

<p>Traditional teriyaki sauce is a blend of soy sauce, sugar, mirin (a sweet rice wine), and sometimes sake or vinegar. The key ingredient that raises concerns for gluten-free diets is soy sauce. Most soy sauces are made from fermented soybeans and wheat, which means they contain gluten. However, there are gluten-free soy sauce options available, which we’ll discuss later in this article.</p>

<h2>Is Traditional Teriyaki Chicken Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, traditional teriyaki chicken is not gluten-free due to the presence of soy sauce made with wheat. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming even small amounts of gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and long-term damage to the small intestine.</p>
