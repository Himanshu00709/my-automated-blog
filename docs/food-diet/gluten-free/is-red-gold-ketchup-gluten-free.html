    <h1>Is Red Gold Ketchup Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Ketchup is a staple condiment in many households, often used to enhance the flavor of burgers, fries, and other dishes. For individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, ensuring that their favorite condiments are gluten-free is crucial. One popular brand that often comes under scrutiny is Red Gold Ketchup. In this article, we will delve into whether Red Gold Ketchup is gluten-free, explore its ingredients, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it is essential to carefully examine the ingredients of any food product, including condiments like ketchup, to ensure they are safe to consume.</p>

    <h2>Red Gold Ketchup: An Overview</h2>

    <p>Red Gold is a well-known brand that has been producing tomato-based products since 1942. Their ketchup is a popular choice for many households due to its rich flavor and high-quality ingredients. But is Red Gold Ketchup gluten-free? Let's take a closer look at its ingredients and manufacturing process.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients in Red Gold Ketchup</h3>
