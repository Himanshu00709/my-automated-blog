    <h1>Is Popcorn Gluten-Free? The Pop Secret Explained</h1>

    <p>Popcorn is a beloved snack enjoyed by millions around the world. Whether you're at the movies, hosting a game night, or simply craving a light and crunchy treat, popcorn is a go-to option. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether popcorn is gluten-free is a crucial one. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the world of popcorn, exploring its gluten-free status, potential cross-contamination risks, and how to enjoy this snack safely.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Does It Matter?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless and can be digested without any issues. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. This is why understanding whether a food item like popcorn is gluten-free is so important.</p>

    <h2>Is Popcorn Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, popcorn is naturally gluten-free. Popcorn is made from a specific type of corn kernel that, when heated, pops and expands into the fluffy snack we all know and love. Corn, in its natural form, does not contain gluten. This means that plain, air-popped popcorn is safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <p>However, the story doesn’t end there. While popcorn itself is gluten-free, the way it is prepared and the ingredients added to it can introduce gluten into the mix. This is where things get a bit more complicated.</p>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Popcorn</h2>

    <p>Even though popcorn is naturally gluten-free, there are several ways gluten can find its way into your snack:</p>

            <tr>
                <td>Flavored Popcorn</td>
