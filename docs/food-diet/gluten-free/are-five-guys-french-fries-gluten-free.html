<h1>Are Five Guys French Fries Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>When it comes to fast food, Five Guys is a popular choice for many, especially for those who love a good burger and fries. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Five Guys French fries are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, preparation methods, and potential cross-contamination risks to help you make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s essential to know whether the food you’re consuming is free from gluten and any potential cross-contamination.</p>

<h2>Are Five Guys French Fries Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>According to Five Guys, their French fries are made from 100% peanut oil and are cooked in a dedicated fryer, which means they do not come into contact with gluten-containing products during the frying process. The potatoes used for the fries are also gluten-free, making the fries themselves gluten-free. However, there are a few important considerations to keep in mind.</p>

<h3>Ingredients in Five Guys French Fries</h3>

<p>The primary ingredients in Five Guys French fries are potatoes, peanut oil, and salt. None of these ingredients contain gluten, which is a good sign for those avoiding gluten. However, it’s always a good idea to check with the staff at your local Five Guys to ensure that no additional seasonings or coatings have been added that might contain gluten.</p>

<h3>Cross-Contamination Risks</h3>

<p>While the fries themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur in the kitchen. For example, if the same utensils or surfaces are used to handle gluten-containing items like buns or breaded items, there’s a risk of gluten particles transferring to the fries. Five Guys does have a dedicated fryer for their fries, which reduces the risk, but it’s not entirely eliminated.</p>

<h3>Five Guys Gluten-Free Menu Options</h3>

<p>In addition to their French fries, Five Guys offers other gluten-free options. Their burgers can be ordered without a bun, and they provide lettuce wraps as an alternative. However, it’s important to note that their milkshakes and some toppings may contain gluten, so always double-check with the staff.</p>
