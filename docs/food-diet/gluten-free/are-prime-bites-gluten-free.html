    <h1>Are Prime Bites Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and the general trend toward healthier eating. Among the many products available in the market, Prime Bites have gained popularity for their convenience and taste. But are Prime Bites gluten-free? This article delves into the details, providing a comprehensive guide to help you make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>What Are Prime Bites?</h2>

    <p>Prime Bites are a type of snack or meal replacement product designed to provide a quick and convenient source of nutrition. They are often marketed as a healthy alternative to traditional snacks, offering a balanced mix of protein, fiber, and essential nutrients. Prime Bites come in various flavors and are typically packaged in individual servings, making them ideal for on-the-go consumption.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives.

This includes obvious sources like bread, pasta, and baked goods, as well as less obvious ones like sauces, dressings, and processed foods. For a product to be labeled as gluten-free, it must meet strict regulatory standards, typically containing less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</p>
