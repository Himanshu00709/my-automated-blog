    <h1>Krystal Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by an increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the general desire for healthier eating habits. Among the many brands that have risen to meet this demand, Krystal has emerged as a notable player in the fast-food industry. Known for its iconic square burgers, Krystal has expanded its menu to include gluten-free options, catering to a broader audience. This article delves into the world of Krystal's gluten-free offerings, exploring their menu, nutritional information, and what makes them a viable choice for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. As a result, many people have turned to gluten-free diets to manage their health. However, finding gluten-free options, especially in fast-food restaurants, can be challenging. This is where Krystal steps in, offering a variety of gluten-free menu items that allow customers to enjoy their favorite fast-food flavors without the worry of gluten exposure.</p>

    <h2>Krystal's Gluten-Free Menu</h2>

    <p>Krystal has made significant strides in accommodating gluten-free diets.
