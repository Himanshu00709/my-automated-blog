    <p>Based on the ingredients listed, Oscar Mayer hot dogs do not contain gluten-containing ingredients. However, it is important to note that the presence of gluten can also depend on the manufacturing process and the potential for cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if a product does not contain gluten in its ingredients, cross-contamination during manufacturing can pose a risk for those with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free products are processed on the same equipment as gluten-containing products.</p>

    <p>Oscar Mayer has stated that they take steps to minimize the risk of cross-contamination, but they do not guarantee that their products are entirely free from gluten. Therefore, individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity should exercise caution and consider reaching out to the manufacturer for more detailed information about their specific products.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification and Labeling</h2>

    <p>One way to ensure that a product is gluten-free is to look for gluten-free certification on the packaging. Certified gluten-free products have been tested and verified to contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

    <p>As of the latest information available, Oscar Mayer hot dogs do not carry a gluten-free certification. However, the absence of certification does not necessarily mean that the product contains gluten. It simply means that the product has not been officially tested and certified by a third-party organization.</p>
