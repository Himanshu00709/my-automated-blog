    <h1>Is Fondant Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Fondant is a popular choice for cake decorators due to its smooth, pliable texture and ability to create intricate designs. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether fondant is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will explore the ingredients used in fondant, its gluten content, and provide tips for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Fondant?</h2>

    <p>Fondant is a type of icing used to decorate cakes and pastries. It is made primarily from sugar, water, and gelatin or glycerin, which gives it a dough-like consistency. Fondant can be rolled out and draped over cakes to create a smooth, polished finish, or it can be molded into various shapes and designs.</p>

    <p>There are two main types of fondant:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rolled Fondant:</strong> This is the most common type of fondant used for covering cakes. It is pliable and can be rolled out into thin sheets.</li>
        <li><strong>Poured Fondant:</strong> This type is more liquid and is typically used for glazing pastries or filling chocolates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Is Fondant Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The primary ingredients in fondant—sugar, water, and gelatin or glycerin—are naturally gluten-free. However, the gluten-free status of fondant can be compromised by additives, flavorings, or cross-contamination during manufacturing. Therefore, it is essential to check the label or contact the manufacturer to confirm whether a specific fondant product is gluten-free.</p>
