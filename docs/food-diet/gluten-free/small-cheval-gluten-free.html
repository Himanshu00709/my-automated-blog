<h1>Small Cheval Gluten-Free Options: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Small Cheval, the beloved Chicago-based burger joint, has earned a reputation for its mouthwatering burgers, crispy fries, and laid-back atmosphere. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. Fortunately, Small Cheval has made strides to accommodate gluten-free diners, offering options that don’t compromise on flavor or quality. In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about Small Cheval’s gluten-free offerings, from their menu options to cross-contamination precautions.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining at Small Cheval</h2>

<p>Gluten-free dining is more than just a trend—it’s a necessity for many individuals. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe health issues for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Small Cheval recognizes this and has taken steps to ensure that gluten-free diners can enjoy their meals safely and deliciously.</p>

<p>While Small Cheval is primarily known for its classic burgers and buns, they have adapted their menu to cater to gluten-free needs. However, it’s important to note that their kitchen is not entirely gluten-free, so cross-contamination is a possibility. Always inform the staff of your dietary restrictions to ensure they take extra precautions.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Menu Options at Small Cheval</h2>

<p>Small Cheval offers a variety of gluten-free options that allow you to enjoy their signature flavors without the gluten. Here’s a breakdown of their gluten-free menu items:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Menu Item</th>
            <th>Gluten-Free Option</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Cheeseburger</td>
            <td>Yes (with gluten-free bun)</td>
            <td>Ask for a gluten-free bun. Be aware of potential cross-contamination.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Fries</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Cooked in a shared fryer, so cross-contamination is possible.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Salad</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Opt for a gluten-free dressing and avoid croutons.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Milkshakes</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Check with staff to ensure no gluten-containing ingredients are used.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Cross-Contamination Concerns</h2>

<p>One of the biggest challenges for gluten-free diners is the risk of cross-contamination. Even if a menu item is inherently gluten-free, it can come into contact with gluten during preparation. At Small Cheval, the kitchen handles gluten-containing ingredients, so cross-contamination is a possibility. Here are some tips to minimize the risk:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Communicate Clearly:</strong> Inform the staff about your gluten intolerance or celiac disease. They can take extra precautions, such as using separate utensils or cleaning surfaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid Shared Fryers:</strong> While the fries are gluten-free, they are cooked in a shared fryer, which may also be used for gluten-containing items.</li>
    <li><strong>Double-Check Ingredients:</strong> Always ask about the ingredients in sauces, dressings, and toppings to ensure they are gluten-free.</li>
</ul>

While their menu is not entirely gluten-free, they offer enough options to make dining enjoyable for those with dietary restrictions. The availability of gluten-free buns and the willingness of the staff to accommodate special requests make Small Cheval a great choice for gluten-free diners in Chicago.</p>

<p>Moreover, the quality of their ingredients ensures that even gluten-free options are packed with flavor. From their juicy beef patties to their fresh toppings, every bite is a testament to their dedication to quality and taste.</p>
