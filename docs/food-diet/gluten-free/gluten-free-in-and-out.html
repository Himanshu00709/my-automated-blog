    <p>In recent years, the gluten-free diet has gained significant attention, not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle. Whether you're dining out or cooking at home, navigating the gluten-free world can be challenging. This guide will provide you with everything you need to know about living gluten-free, from understanding what gluten is to finding the best gluten-free options when eating out.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It acts as a binding agent, giving bread and other baked goods their elasticity and chewy texture.

        <li><strong>Celiac Disease:</strong> An autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity:</strong> A condition where individuals experience symptoms similar to celiac disease but without the intestinal damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Wheat Allergy:</strong> An allergic reaction to proteins found in wheat, which can cause symptoms ranging from mild to severe.</li>
        <li><strong>Health and Wellness:</strong> Some people believe that a gluten-free diet can lead to improved digestion, increased energy, and overall better health.</li>
