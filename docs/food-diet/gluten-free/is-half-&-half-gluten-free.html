<h1>Is Half & Half Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, understanding which foods are safe to consume is crucial. One common question that arises is whether half & half is gluten-free. This article delves into the details of half & half, its ingredients, and whether it is safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>What is Half & Half?</h2>

<p>Half & half is a dairy product that is a blend of equal parts whole milk and light cream. It typically contains about 10-12% fat, making it richer than milk but lighter than heavy cream. Half & half is commonly used in coffee, tea, and various recipes to add a creamy texture without the heaviness of full cream.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Half & Half</h2>

<p>The primary ingredients in half & half are milk and cream. However, some brands may include additional ingredients such as stabilizers, emulsifiers, or flavorings. It's essential to read the label carefully to ensure there are no hidden sources of gluten.</p>
