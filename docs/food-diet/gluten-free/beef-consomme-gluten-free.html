            <td>8-10 cups</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Stock:</strong> In a large pot, combine the beef bones, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, peppercorns, and salt. Add enough water to cover the ingredients by about 2 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 4-6 hours, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Strain the Stock:</strong> Once the stock is rich and flavorful, strain it through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove all solids. Discard the solids and return the clear stock to the pot.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarify the Consommé:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk the egg whites until frothy. Add the ground beef and mix well. Slowly add this mixture to the strained stock, stirring gently. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally. As the mixture heats, the egg whites and ground beef will form a raft on the surface, trapping impurities. Simmer for about 30 minutes, then carefully strain the consommé through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove the raft.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Your gluten-free beef consommé is now ready to serve. It can be enjoyed hot, garnished with fresh herbs or a splash of gluten-free soy sauce for added flavor.</li>
