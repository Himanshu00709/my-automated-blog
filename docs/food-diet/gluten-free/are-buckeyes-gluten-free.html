    <h1>Are Buckeyes Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Buckeyes are a beloved treat, especially in the Midwest, known for their rich, peanut butter and chocolate flavor. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, determining whether buckeyes are safe to consume is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients typically used in buckeyes, whether they are gluten-free, and how to ensure your buckeyes are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Buckeyes?</h2>

    <p>Buckeyes are a no-bake dessert made primarily from peanut butter, powdered sugar, butter, and chocolate. They are named after the nut of the buckeye tree due to their resemblance in shape and color. These sweet treats are often enjoyed during holidays and special occasions, but their simplicity makes them a year-round favorite.</p>

    <h2>Are Traditional Buckeyes Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The good news is that traditional buckeyes are naturally gluten-free. The primary ingredients—peanut butter, powdered sugar, butter, and chocolate—do not contain gluten. However, there are a few factors to consider to ensure that your buckeyes remain gluten-free:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Peanut Butter:</strong> Most peanut butter brands are gluten-free, but it’s essential to check the label for any additives or cross-contamination warnings.</li>
        <li><strong>Powdered Sugar:</strong> Pure powdered sugar is gluten-free, but some brands may use anti-caking agents that contain gluten. Always verify the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Butter is naturally gluten-free, but flavored or compound butters may contain gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate:</strong> While pure chocolate is gluten-free, some chocolate brands may process their products in facilities that also handle gluten-containing ingredients, leading to cross-contamination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Buckeyes</h2>

    <p>While the core ingredients of buckeyes are gluten-free, there are potential sources of gluten that you should be aware of:</p>
