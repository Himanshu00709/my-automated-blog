<h1>Are Marshmallows Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Marshmallows are a beloved treat enjoyed by people of all ages. Whether you're roasting them over a campfire, adding them to hot chocolate, or using them in desserts, marshmallows are a versatile and delicious snack. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether marshmallows are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we'll explore the ingredients used in marshmallows, discuss potential sources of gluten, and provide tips for ensuring that your marshmallows are safe to eat.</p>

<h2>What Are Marshmallows Made Of?</h2>

<p>Marshmallows are typically made from a few simple ingredients: sugar, water, gelatin, and corn syrup. These ingredients are whipped together to create a light, fluffy texture. Some marshmallows may also contain additional flavorings, colorings, or stabilizers. The primary concern for those avoiding gluten is whether any of these ingredients contain gluten or are processed in facilities that handle gluten-containing products.</p>
