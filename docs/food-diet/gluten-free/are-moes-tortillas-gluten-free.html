    <h1>Are Moe's Tortillas Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>When it comes to dining out, especially for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, understanding the ingredients in your food is crucial. Moe's Southwest Grill, a popular fast-casual restaurant chain, is known for its customizable burritos, tacos, and bowls. But are Moe's tortillas gluten-free? This article dives deep into the ingredients, preparation methods, and options available for gluten-free diners at Moe's.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it's essential for these individuals to ensure that their food is free from gluten contamination.</p>

    <h2>Are Moe's Tortillas Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Moe's Southwest Grill offers a variety of tortilla options, including flour tortillas, whole wheat tortillas, and corn tortillas. However, not all of these are gluten-free. Here's a breakdown:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Tortilla Type</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free?</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Flour Tortillas</td>
                <td>No</td>
                <td>Made from wheat flour, which contains gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Whole Wheat Tortillas</td>
                <td>No</td>
                <td>Also made from wheat flour, containing gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Corn Tortillas</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
                <td>Made from corn, which is naturally gluten-free. However, cross-contamination is possible.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As shown in the table, Moe's corn tortillas are the only gluten-free option. However, it's important to note that cross-contamination can occur in the kitchen, especially if the same equipment is used to prepare both gluten-containing and gluten-free items.
