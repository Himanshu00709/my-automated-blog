<p>As you can see, most of the ingredients in chicken al pastor are naturally gluten-free. However, there are some potential sources of gluten that you need to be aware of, especially when dining out or purchasing pre-made marinades.</p>

<h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Chicken Al Pastor</h2>

<p>While the core ingredients of chicken al pastor are gluten-free, there are a few areas where gluten can sneak in:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Marinades and Sauces:</strong> Some commercial marinades or sauces may contain gluten as a thickening agent or flavor enhancer. Always check the label or ask the chef about the ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If the chicken is prepared in a kitchen that also handles gluten-containing foods, there’s a risk of cross-contamination. This is especially common in restaurants that serve both gluten-free and gluten-containing dishes.</li>
    <li><strong>Tortillas:</strong> While corn tortillas are naturally gluten-free, some restaurants may use flour tortillas or fry their tortillas in shared oil, which can introduce gluten.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Ensure Your Chicken Al Pastor is Gluten-Free</h2>

<p>If you’re preparing chicken al pastor at home, you have full control over the ingredients, making it easier to ensure the dish is gluten-free. Here are some tips:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Make Your Own Marinade:</strong> By making your own marinade, you can avoid any hidden gluten in store-bought versions. Use fresh spices, achiote paste, and gluten-free vinegar.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Certified Gluten-Free Ingredients:</strong> If you’re using pre-packaged ingredients, look for those that are certified gluten-free to minimize the risk of contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare in a Gluten-Free Kitchen:</strong> If you share a kitchen with gluten-eaters, make sure to thoroughly clean all surfaces and utensils before preparing your chicken al pastor.</li>
</ul>

<p>When dining out, don’t hesitate to ask the restaurant staff about their preparation methods and whether they can accommodate a gluten-free diet. Many restaurants are becoming more aware of gluten sensitivities and may offer gluten-free options or modifications.</p>
