<h1>Gluten-Free Sauces: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of sauces can be a daunting task. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, is a common ingredient in many sauces, making it essential to identify which sauces are safe to consume. This guide will explore the various types of gluten-free sauces, provide tips for identifying them, and offer alternatives for those looking to maintain a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten in Sauces</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Wheat flour</li>
