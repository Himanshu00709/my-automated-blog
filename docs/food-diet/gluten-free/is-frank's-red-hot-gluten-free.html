    <h1>Is Frank's RedHot Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Frank's RedHot is a beloved hot sauce that has been a staple in kitchens for decades.

But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Is Frank's RedHot gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we'll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to provide a clear answer.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it's crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and manufacturing processes of the foods they consume.</p>

However, the company has implemented strict cleaning protocols to minimize the risk of cross-contamination.</p>
