    <h1>Is Lawry's Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>When it comes to seasoning blends, Lawry's is a household name. Known for its rich flavors and versatility, Lawry's seasoning salt is a staple in many kitchens. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Lawry's is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential cross-contamination risks associated with Lawry's products to determine if they are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Implications</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions. Therefore, it's crucial to scrutinize the ingredients and production processes of any food product to ensure it is free from gluten.</p>

    <h2>Lawry's Seasoning Salt: Ingredients Breakdown</h2>

    <p>To determine if Lawry's seasoning salt is gluten-free, we first need to examine its ingredients. The primary components of Lawry's seasoning salt include:</p>

            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Onion Powder</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Garlic Powder</td>

    <p>As seen in the table above, the ingredients in Lawry's seasoning salt are inherently gluten-free. However, it's essential to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur if the product is manufactured in a facility that also processes gluten-containing products. Lawry's, a brand under the McCormick & Company, has a reputation for stringent quality control measures. According to McCormick's official statements, they take great care to prevent cross-contamination and clearly label any products that may contain gluten.</p>

    <p>However, it's always advisable to check the packaging for any gluten-free certifications or allergen statements. If the product is labeled as gluten-free, it means that it has been tested and confirmed to contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>
