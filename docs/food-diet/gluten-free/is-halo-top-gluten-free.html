    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Flavor</th>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

    <p>While Halo Top labels many of its products as gluten-free, it’s important to understand what this means. In the United States, the FDA requires that any product labeled as gluten-free must contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. This is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease. However, Halo Top does not have a certified gluten-free label, which means that while they strive to keep gluten out of their products, there is always a risk of cross-contamination during manufacturing.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Halo Top and Gluten</h2>

        <p>Halo Top is not certified gluten-free, but many of their products meet the FDA’s gluten-free standards of containing less than 20 ppm of gluten.</p>

        <h3>3. Can people with celiac disease eat Halo Top?</h3>
        <p>Most people with celiac disease can safely enjoy Halo Top’s gluten-free flavors. However, those with severe sensitivities should be cautious due to the risk of cross-contamination.</p>
