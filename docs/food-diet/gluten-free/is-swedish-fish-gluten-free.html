    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Sugar</td>
                <td>Provides sweetness</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Invert Sugar</td>
                <td>Prevents crystallization and adds moisture</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Corn Syrup</td>
                <td>Adds chewiness and sweetness</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Modified Corn Starch</td>
                <td>Provides structure and texture</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Citric Acid</td>
                <td>Adds tartness and acts as a preservative</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Natural and Artificial Flavors</td>
                <td>Enhances taste</td>
            </tr>

    <p>None of these ingredients contain gluten, which is a positive sign for those with gluten sensitivities. However, it's important to consider the manufacturing process and potential cross-contamination risks.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients in Swedish Fish are gluten-free, cross-contamination during the manufacturing process could introduce gluten into the product. Cross-contamination can occur if the same equipment is used to produce both gluten-containing and gluten-free products without proper cleaning in between.</p>

    <p>According to the manufacturer, Mondelez International, Swedish Fish are produced in facilities that also process products containing gluten. However, the company states that they have strict cleaning protocols in place to prevent cross-contamination. Additionally, Swedish Fish are labeled as gluten-free, which means they meet the FDA's requirement of containing less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</p>

    <h2>Are Swedish Fish Safe for Celiac Disease Patients?</h2>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease, even trace amounts of gluten can cause severe reactions. While Swedish Fish are labeled as gluten-free and the manufacturer claims to follow strict protocols to prevent cross-contamination, there is always a small risk of contamination in facilities that also process gluten-containing products.</p>

    <p>If you have celiac disease or are highly sensitive to gluten, it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider before consuming Swedish Fish. Some individuals may choose to avoid products made in shared facilities altogether, while others may feel comfortable consuming products labeled as gluten-free.</p>
