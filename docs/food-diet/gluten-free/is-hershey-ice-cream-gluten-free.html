For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize food labels and understand the ingredients in the products they consume.</p>
