    <h1>Gluten-Free Twin Peaks: A Culinary Adventure</h1>

    <p>In the world of dietary restrictions, gluten-free living has become a significant movement. For those who suffer from celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or simply choose to avoid gluten for health reasons, finding delicious and safe dining options can be a challenge. Enter Twin Peaks, a popular restaurant chain known for its hearty, comfort food and rustic ambiance. But can Twin Peaks cater to the gluten-free crowd? In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free options at Twin Peaks, provide tips for dining out, and share some insights into the gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including damage to the small intestine, nutrient malabsorption, and a host of other symptoms. Even for those without celiac disease, gluten sensitivity can cause discomfort, bloating, and fatigue. As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to improve their health and well-being.</p>

    <p>When dining out, it’s crucial for gluten-free individuals to be aware of cross-contamination risks. Even if a dish is inherently gluten-free, it can become contaminated if it’s prepared on the same surfaces or with the same utensils as gluten-containing foods. This is why it’s essential to communicate your dietary needs clearly to restaurant staff.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Options at Twin Peaks</h2>

    <p>Twin Peaks is known for its hearty, indulgent menu, which includes burgers, sandwiches, and fried appetizers. While many of these items contain gluten, Twin Peaks has made efforts to accommodate gluten-free diners. Here’s a breakdown of some gluten-free options you can enjoy at Twin Peaks:</p>
