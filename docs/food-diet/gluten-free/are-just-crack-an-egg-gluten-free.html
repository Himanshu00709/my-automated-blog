    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Implications</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and long-term complications. Therefore, it’s crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize food labels and ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Are Just Crack an Egg Products Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients to Watch Out For</h3>

    <table>

            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
                <th>Notes</th>

    <h3>Cross-Contamination Risks</h3>

    <p>Even if the ingredients in a Just Crack an Egg kit are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing is a potential concern.

For individuals with celiac disease, even small amounts of gluten can trigger symptoms.</p>

    <h2>How to Determine if a Product is Gluten-Free</h2>

    <p>To ensure a product is safe for a gluten-free diet, follow these steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Read the Label:</strong> Look for a "gluten-free" certification or statement on the packaging.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the Ingredients:</strong> Scan the ingredient list for hidden sources of gluten, such as malt, modified food starch, or hydrolyzed wheat protein.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact the Manufacturer:</strong> If you’re unsure, reach out to the company for clarification on their gluten-free practices.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Just Crack an Egg</h2>

    <p>If you’re unable to confirm the gluten-free status of a Just Crack an Egg product or prefer to avoid potential risks, consider these alternatives:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Homemade Scrambles:</strong> Prepare your own breakfast scramble using fresh, gluten-free ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Certified Gluten-Free Kits:</strong> Look for breakfast kits that are explicitly labeled as gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Meal Prep:</strong> Spend a few minutes prepping your breakfast ingredients in advance for quick assembly in the morning.</li>
