Known for their high protein content and whole grain ingredients, Kodiak Cakes are a favorite among fitness enthusiasts and health-conscious individuals. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question remains: Are Kodiak Cakes gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and options available for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.
