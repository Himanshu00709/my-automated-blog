<h1>Gluten-Free Beer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and the beer industry is no exception. For those with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or those simply choosing a gluten-free lifestyle, finding a beer that fits their dietary needs can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free beer—a beverage that allows everyone to enjoy the rich flavors of beer without the adverse effects of gluten. In this article, we’ll explore what gluten-free beer is, how it’s made, its benefits, and some of the best options available on the market today.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free beer is a type of beer that is brewed without the use of gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, or rye. Traditional beers are typically made from these grains, which contain gluten—a protein that can cause digestive issues for people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Gluten-free beer, on the other hand, is made using alternative grains like sorghum, rice, millet, or corn, which do not contain gluten. Some breweries also use enzymes to break down gluten in traditional beers, making them safe for those with gluten intolerance.</p>

<h2>How is Gluten-Free Beer Made?</h2>

<p>The process of making gluten-free beer is similar to that of traditional beer, with a few key differences. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
