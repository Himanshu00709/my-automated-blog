<h1>Is Domino Confectioners Sugar Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, ensuring that every ingredient in their diet is gluten-free is crucial. One common ingredient that often raises questions is confectioners sugar, also known as powdered sugar. Specifically, many wonder: <strong>Is Domino Confectioners Sugar gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the details, examining the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential risks associated with Domino Confectioners Sugar to provide a comprehensive answer.</p>

<h2>What is Domino Confectioners Sugar?</h2>

<p>Domino Confectioners Sugar is a finely ground sugar product that is commonly used in baking and dessert recipes. It is made by grinding granulated sugar into a fine powder and then mixing it with a small amount of cornstarch to prevent clumping. This sugar is widely used for making frostings, glazes, and dusting desserts.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is responsible for the elastic texture of dough and is commonly found in bread, pasta, and baked goods. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and long-term damage to the small intestine.</p>

<p>Given the potential health risks, it’s essential to scrutinize the ingredients and manufacturing processes of food products to ensure they are gluten-free.</p>

<h2>Is Domino Confectioners Sugar Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>According to Domino Foods, Inc., the manufacturer of Domino Confectioners Sugar, their product is <strong>gluten-free</strong>. The primary ingredients in Domino Confectioners Sugar are sugar and cornstarch, both of which are naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to consider the potential for cross-contamination during the manufacturing process.</p>

<p>Domino Foods states that they follow strict manufacturing practices to prevent cross-contamination with gluten-containing products. They also conduct regular testing to ensure that their products meet gluten-free standards. As a result, Domino Confectioners Sugar is considered safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Sugar</td>
