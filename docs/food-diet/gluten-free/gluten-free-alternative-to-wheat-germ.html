    <h1>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Wheat Germ: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Wheat germ is a nutrient-dense component of the wheat kernel, often praised for its high levels of vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats. However, for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those following a gluten-free diet, wheat germ is off the table due to its gluten content.
