    <h1>Wendy's Gluten-Free Options: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, Wendy's has made strides in offering gluten-free options that cater to those who need to avoid gluten. In this article, we'll explore Wendy's gluten-free menu, discuss the precautions they take to avoid cross-contamination, and provide tips for safely enjoying your meal.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including damage to the small intestine. Even those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity may experience symptoms like bloating, headaches, and fatigue after consuming gluten. Therefore, finding safe, gluten-free options is crucial for these individuals.</p>

    <h2>Wendy's Gluten-Free Menu Options</h2>
    <p>Wendy's offers a variety of menu items that are naturally gluten-free or can be modified to be gluten-free. Below is a table summarizing some of the most popular gluten-free options available at Wendy's:</p>

        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Menu Item</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>

    <p>While Wendy's offers several gluten-free options, it's important to note that cross-contamination can occur in their kitchens. Wendy's does not have a dedicated gluten-free preparation area, so there is a risk of gluten exposure from shared cooking surfaces and utensils. If you have severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, it's essential to communicate your dietary needs clearly to the staff and ask about their preparation practices.</p>
