                <td>Chicken Breast</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Water</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>

                <td>Rice Flour</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Spices</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>

                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As you can see, all the primary ingredients in Just Bare Chicken Nuggets are gluten-free. The breading is made from rice flour and corn starch, both of which are naturally gluten-free. Additionally, the seasonings and spices used do not contain gluten.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination</h2>

    <p>While the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, it’s crucial to consider the manufacturing process. Cross-contamination can occur if the product is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing ingredients. This is a significant concern for individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <p>According to the manufacturer, Just Bare Chicken Nuggets are produced in a facility that also processes wheat and other gluten-containing products. However, the company follows strict cleaning protocols to minimize the risk of cross-contamination. Despite these precautions, there is still a possibility of trace amounts of gluten being present in the final product.</p>

    <h2>Certifications and Labeling</h2>

    <p>Just Bare Chicken Nuggets are not certified gluten-free by any third-party organizations, such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). However, the product is labeled as "gluten-free" on the packaging, which means it meets the FDA’s requirements for gluten-free labeling. According to the FDA, a product can be labeled gluten-free if it contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</p>

    <p>For most people with gluten sensitivity, this level is considered safe. However, individuals with celiac disease should exercise caution and consult with their healthcare provider before consuming products that are not certified gluten-free.</p>
