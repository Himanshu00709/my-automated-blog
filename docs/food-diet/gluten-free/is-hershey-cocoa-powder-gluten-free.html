    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, ensuring that the foods they consume are gluten-free is crucial. One common question that arises is whether Hershey's Cocoa Powder is gluten-free. This article will delve into the details, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of Hershey's Cocoa Powder and its gluten-free status.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Implications</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it's essential to carefully scrutinize food labels and understand the ingredients in the products you consume.</p>

According to Hershey's, their natural unsweetened cocoa powder does not contain gluten ingredients. However, it's important to note that Hershey's does not label their cocoa powder as "certified gluten-free."</p>

    <p>Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key points:</p>
