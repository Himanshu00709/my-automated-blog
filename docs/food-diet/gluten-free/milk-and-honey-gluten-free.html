    <h1>Milk and Honey Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by an increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders and a growing preference for healthier dietary choices. Among the many gluten-free options available, milk and honey have emerged as popular ingredients in gluten-free recipes. This blog post delves into the benefits of milk and honey in a gluten-free diet, their nutritional profiles, and how they can be incorporated into your daily meals.</p>

    <h2>What Does Gluten-Free Mean?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergy, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and autoimmune reactions. A gluten-free diet eliminates all sources of gluten, requiring careful selection of ingredients and products.</p>

    <h2>Why Milk and Honey?</h2>

    <p>Milk and honey are naturally gluten-free and offer a range of health benefits. Milk is a rich source of calcium, vitamin D, and protein, essential for bone health and muscle function. Honey, on the other hand, is a natural sweetener packed with antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Together, they can enhance the flavor and nutritional value of gluten-free recipes.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Milk and Honey</h2>

    <p>Both milk and honey are nutrient-dense foods that can complement a gluten-free diet. Below is a table comparing their nutritional profiles:</p>
