<h1>Is Frank's Hot Sauce Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>Frank's RedHot Sauce has been a staple in kitchens for decades, known for its tangy, spicy flavor that enhances everything from wings to dips. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Frank's Hot Sauce is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to determine if Frank's Hot Sauce is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to long-term health complications. Therefore, it’s essential to scrutinize food labels and understand the manufacturing processes of products like hot sauce to ensure they are gluten-free.</p>

<p>Frank's RedHot Original Cayenne Pepper Sauce is made from a simple list of ingredients:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Aged Cayenne Red Peppers</li>
    <li>Distilled Vinegar</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Garlic Powder</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it’s important to consider potential cross-contamination during manufacturing or the use of additives that might contain gluten.</p>

<h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination</h2>

However, the company follows rigorous cleaning protocols to prevent cross-contamination.</p>

<p>Despite these precautions, individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease should be aware of the potential risk of cross-contamination. For most people, the risk is minimal, but it’s always best to consult with a healthcare provider if you have concerns.</p>

<h2>Certifications and Gluten-Free Claims</h2>

<p>Frank's RedHot Sauce does not carry an official gluten-free certification from organizations like the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). However, McCormick states that Frank's RedHot Sauce is gluten-free based on the ingredients used and the manufacturing processes in place. The absence of gluten-containing ingredients and the company’s commitment to preventing cross-contamination make it a safe choice for most people following a gluten-free diet.</p>
