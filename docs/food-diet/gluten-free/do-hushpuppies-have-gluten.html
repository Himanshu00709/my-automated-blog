    <h1>Do Hushpuppies Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Hushpuppies are a beloved Southern staple, often served alongside fried fish, barbecue, or as a standalone snack. These golden, deep-fried balls of cornmeal batter are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, making them a favorite for many. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Do hushpuppies have gluten?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, preparation methods, and gluten-free alternatives to help you enjoy hushpuppies without worry.</p>

    <h2>What Are Hushpuppies Made Of?</h2>

    <p>Traditional hushpuppies are made from a simple batter consisting of cornmeal, flour, eggs, milk, and seasonings. The mixture is then deep-fried to achieve its signature crispy texture. While cornmeal is naturally gluten-free, the addition of wheat flour is what introduces gluten into the recipe. This means that most traditional hushpuppies are not gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten in Hushpuppies</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It provides elasticity and structure to baked goods, which is why it’s commonly used in batters and doughs. In hushpuppies, wheat flour is often used to bind the ingredients together and create a light, fluffy texture. However, this also means that anyone with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease must avoid traditional hushpuppies.</p>
