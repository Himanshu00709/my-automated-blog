Its rich blend of basil, garlic, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil makes it a versatile condiment for pasta, sandwiches, and more. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether pesto contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients of traditional pesto, potential sources of gluten, and how to enjoy gluten-free pesto safely.</p>

    <h2>What is Pesto Made Of?</h2>

    <p>Traditional pesto, known as <em>Pesto alla Genovese</em>, is made from a few simple ingredients:</p>

    <h3>3. Non-Traditional Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Some pesto recipes or products may include ingredients like breadcrumbs, wheat-based thickeners, or modified food starch, which contain gluten. Always verify the ingredients list.</p>

    <h2>How to Ensure Your Pesto is Gluten-Free</h2>

    <p>If you’re following a gluten-free diet, here are some tips to enjoy pesto safely:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Make It at Home:</strong> Preparing pesto from scratch allows you to control the ingredients and avoid gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Labels:</strong> When buying store-bought pesto, look for products labeled “gluten-free.”</li>
