<h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Chop Suey</h2>

<p>While many of the core ingredients in chop suey are naturally gluten-free, there are several potential sources of gluten that you need to be aware of:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Soy Sauce:</strong> Traditional soy sauce is made from fermented soybeans and wheat, making it a common source of gluten. If you’re making chop suey at home, opt for a gluten-free soy sauce. When dining out, ask if the restaurant uses gluten-free soy sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Oyster Sauce:</strong> Oyster sauce is another common ingredient in chop suey that often contains wheat. Look for gluten-free oyster sauce or consider using a gluten-free alternative like hoisin sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Marinades and Sauces:</strong> Many pre-made marinades and sauces contain gluten as a thickening agent. Always check the labels or ask about the ingredients when dining out.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> Even if all the ingredients in chop suey are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during preparation. This is especially common in restaurants where gluten-containing foods are prepared in the same kitchen.</li>
</ul>
