    <h1>Broccoli: A Gluten-Free Superfood</h1>
    <p>Broccoli, a member of the cruciferous vegetable family, has long been celebrated for its nutritional benefits. But did you know that broccoli is also naturally gluten-free? For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding safe and nutritious foods can be a challenge. Broccoli, however, is a versatile and nutrient-dense option that can be easily incorporated into a gluten-free diet. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of broccoli, its role in a gluten-free lifestyle, and how you can make the most of this superfood.</p>

    <h2>Why Broccoli is a Gluten-Free Powerhouse</h2>
    <p>Broccoli is naturally free from gluten, making it a safe choice for those who need to avoid this protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.

        <li><strong>High in Vitamins:</strong> Broccoli is loaded with vitamins C, K, and A, which are essential for immune function, bone health, and vision, respectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Antioxidant Properties:</strong> The antioxidants in broccoli, such as sulforaphane, help reduce inflammation and protect against chronic diseases.</li>
        <li><strong>Low in Calories:</strong> Broccoli is low in calories but high in nutrients, making it an ideal food for weight management.</li>
