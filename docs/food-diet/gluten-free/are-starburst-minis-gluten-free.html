    <h1>Are Starburst Minis Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of snacks can be a daunting task. One popular treat that often comes under scrutiny is Starburst Minis. These bite-sized, chewy candies are a favorite among many, but are they safe for those who need to avoid gluten? In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore whether Starburst Minis are gluten-free, what ingredients to look out for, and how to enjoy them safely.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial to understand whether the foods we consume contain gluten or are processed in a way that could lead to cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Are Starburst Minis Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>According to the manufacturer, Mars Wrigley, Starburst Minis are considered gluten-free. The ingredients used in Starburst Minis do not include any gluten-containing grains. However, it’s important to note that while the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. Mars Wrigley states that they take precautions to prevent cross-contamination, but they do not guarantee that their products are entirely free from gluten.</p>
