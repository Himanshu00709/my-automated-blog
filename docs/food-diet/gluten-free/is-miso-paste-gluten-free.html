<h1>Is Miso Paste Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Miso paste, a staple in Japanese cuisine, is renowned for its rich, umami flavor and versatility in cooking. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, determining whether miso paste is gluten-free is crucial. This article delves into the intricacies of miso paste, its ingredients, and whether it aligns with a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What is Miso Paste?</h2>

<p>Miso paste is a traditional Japanese seasoning produced by fermenting soybeans with salt and koji (a type of fungus, Aspergillus oryzae).
