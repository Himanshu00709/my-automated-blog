    <h1>Is Egg Salad Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Egg salad is a classic dish enjoyed by many, whether as a sandwich filling, a topping for crackers, or a standalone salad. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, determining whether egg salad is gluten-free can be a crucial concern. In this article, we will explore the ingredients typically found in egg salad, discuss potential sources of gluten, and provide tips for ensuring your egg salad is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is responsible for the elastic texture of dough and is commonly found in bread, pasta, cereals, and many processed foods. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and long-term health complications.</p>

    <p>When it comes to egg salad, the primary ingredients—eggs, mayonnaise, and mustard—are naturally gluten-free. However, the devil is in the details. Some store-bought mayonnaise and mustard brands may contain gluten due to added ingredients or cross-contamination during manufacturing. Additionally, if you're adding other ingredients like relish, spices, or breadcrumbs, these could also introduce gluten into your egg salad.</p>
