    <h1>Exploring Gluten-Free Options in Japan: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Japan, a country renowned for its rich culinary traditions, is often associated with dishes like sushi, ramen, and tempura. However, for those following a gluten-free diet, navigating Japanese cuisine can be a challenge. Wheat-based ingredients like soy sauce and udon noodles are staples in many Japanese dishes, making it difficult for gluten-sensitive individuals to enjoy the local fare. But fear not! Japan is increasingly becoming more accommodating to gluten-free diets, with a growing number of restaurants, supermarkets, and resources catering to this need. In this guide, we’ll explore the gluten-free landscape in Japan, offering tips, recommendations, and insights to help you enjoy your culinary journey.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten in Japanese Cuisine</h2>
    <p>Before diving into gluten-free options, it’s essential to understand where gluten hides in Japanese cuisine. Wheat is a common ingredient in many traditional dishes, often in forms that may not be immediately obvious. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Soy Sauce:</strong> Most soy sauces contain wheat as a primary ingredient, making them unsuitable for gluten-free diets.</li>
        <li><strong>Udon and Soba Noodles:</strong> While soba noodles are typically made from buckwheat, many varieties include wheat flour, so it’s crucial to check the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Tempura:</strong> The batter used for tempura is usually made with wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Miso Soup:</strong> Some miso pastes contain barley or wheat, so it’s important to verify the ingredients.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Being aware of these hidden sources of gluten is the first step in navigating a gluten-free diet in Japan.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Dining in Japan</h2>
    <p>Despite the challenges, Japan offers a variety of gluten-free dining options. Many restaurants, especially in larger cities like Tokyo and Kyoto, are becoming more aware of gluten-free needs. Here are some tips for finding gluten-free meals:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>City</th>
                <th>Restaurant</th>
                <th>Specialty</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Tokyo</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free T’s Kitchen</td>
                <td>Gluten-free ramen and curry</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>Mumokuteki Cafe</td>
                <td>Vegetarian and gluten-free options</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Osaka</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free Cafe Littlebird</td>
