<h2>Potential Gluten Sources in Malai Kofta</h2>

<p>While many ingredients in Malai Kofta are naturally gluten-free, there are a few areas where gluten can sneak in:</p>

<h3>1. Flour Used for Binding Koftas</h3>
<p>Traditionally, wheat flour or all-purpose flour is used to bind the kofta mixture. This is a significant source of gluten. However, gluten-free alternatives like chickpea flour (besan), rice flour, or cornstarch can be used as substitutes.</p>

<h3>2. Cross-Contamination</h3>
<p>Cross-contamination can occur if the same utensils, cutting boards, or frying oil are used for gluten-containing foods. Always ensure that the kitchen equipment is thoroughly cleaned or dedicated to gluten-free cooking.</p>

<h3>3. Pre-Packaged Spices</h3>
<p>Some pre-packaged spices may contain additives or anti-caking agents that include gluten. Always check the labels or opt for certified gluten-free spices.</p>

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Malai Kofta</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free Malai Kofta is entirely possible with a few adjustments:</p>

<h3>1. Use Gluten-Free Flour</h3>
<p>Replace wheat flour with gluten-free alternatives like chickpea flour, rice flour, or cornstarch for binding the koftas. These flours work just as well and add a unique flavor to the dish.</p>

<h3>2. Check Spices and Ingredients</h3>
<p>Ensure that all spices and ingredients are certified gluten-free. If you’re unsure, grind your spices at home to avoid any risk of contamination.</p>

<h3>3. Avoid Cross-Contamination</h3>
<p>Use separate utensils, cutting boards, and frying oil for gluten-free cooking. If you’re dining out, communicate your dietary needs clearly to the chef.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Malai Kofta</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use almond flour for koftas?</h3>
    <p>Yes, almond flour can be used as a gluten-free alternative for binding koftas. However, it may alter the texture slightly, making the koftas denser.</p>

    <h3>2. Is store-bought Malai Kofta mix gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Not all store-bought mixes are gluten-free. Always check the label for gluten-containing ingredients or opt for certified gluten-free mixes.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make Malai Kofta without frying?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can bake or air-fry the koftas for a healthier, gluten-free version. This method reduces the risk of cross-contamination from shared frying oil.</p>

    <h3>4. Are restaurant Malai Koftas safe for celiacs?</h3>
    <p>It depends on the restaurant’s preparation methods. Always inform the staff about your gluten intolerance and ask about their cooking practices.</p>
