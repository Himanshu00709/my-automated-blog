<h1>Is Chicken Curry Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Chicken curry is a beloved dish enjoyed by millions around the world. Its rich flavors, aromatic spices, and tender chicken make it a staple in many cuisines. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether chicken curry is gluten-free is of utmost importance. In this article, we will explore the ingredients commonly used in chicken curry, identify potential sources of gluten, and provide tips for making a gluten-free version of this classic dish.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is commonly found in bread, pasta, cereals, and many processed foods.

Therefore, it is crucial to identify and avoid gluten-containing ingredients when preparing meals.</p>

<p>Chicken curry recipes vary widely depending on the region and personal preferences. However, some common ingredients include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Chicken</li>
    <li>Onions</li>

    <li>Spices (e.g., turmeric, cumin, coriander, chili powder)</li>
    <li>Coconut milk or yogurt</li>
    <li>Oil or ghee</li>
</ul>

<p>While many of these ingredients are naturally gluten-free, there are potential sources of gluten that can sneak into the dish. Let's take a closer look at these potential culprits.</p>
