    <h1>Gluten-Free Bread: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Gluten-free bread has become a staple for many individuals, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or a personal choice to avoid gluten. This guide will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free bread, from its nutritional benefits to how to make it at home. Whether you're new to gluten-free living or a seasoned pro, this article will provide valuable insights and tips.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Bread?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free bread is made without gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Traditional bread relies on gluten for its structure and elasticity, but gluten-free bread uses alternative flours and binding agents to achieve a similar texture. Common gluten-free flours include rice flour, almond flour, coconut flour, and tapioca flour. These flours are often combined with xanthan gum or psyllium husk to mimic the elasticity that gluten provides.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Bread?</h2>
    <p>There are several reasons why someone might choose gluten-free bread:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Celiac Disease:</strong> An autoimmune disorder where gluten consumption damages the small intestine.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten Sensitivity:</strong> Non-celiac individuals who experience symptoms like bloating, headaches, or fatigue after consuming gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Wheat Allergy:</strong> An allergic reaction to proteins found in wheat, which is different from gluten intolerance.</li>
        <li><strong>Dietary Preference:</strong> Some people choose gluten-free diets for perceived health benefits or weight management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Bread</h2>
