    <h1>Are Swedish Fish Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Swedish Fish are a beloved candy that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for decades. Known for their chewy texture and fruity flavor, these iconic red candies are a staple in many households. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Swedish Fish are gluten-free is of utmost importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to determine if Swedish Fish are safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including damage to the small intestine, nutrient malabsorption, and a host of other symptoms. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can cause discomfort and adverse reactions. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and manufacturing processes of the foods they consume.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Swedish Fish</h2>

    <p>To determine if Swedish Fish are gluten-free, we must first examine their ingredients. The primary ingredients in Swedish Fish include:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Sugar</td>
                <td>Sweetener</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Invert Sugar</td>
                <td>Sweetener and moisture retention</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Corn Syrup</td>
                <td>Sweetener and texture</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Modified Corn Starch</td>
                <td>Thickening agent</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Citric Acid</td>
                <td>Flavor enhancer and preservative</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Natural and Artificial Flavors</td>
                <td>Flavoring</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mineral Oil</td>
                <td>Prevents sticking</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Carnauba Wax</td>
                <td>Adds shine and prevents sticking</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As we can see from the table, Swedish Fish do not contain any obvious sources of gluten such as wheat, barley, or rye. However, it is important to note that the presence of modified corn starch could raise concerns for some individuals, as corn starch can sometimes be processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination</h2>

    <p>Even if a product does not contain gluten-containing ingredients, cross-contamination during the manufacturing process can still pose a risk. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free products come into contact with gluten-containing products or surfaces, potentially introducing gluten into the final product.</p>

    <p>Swedish Fish are manufactured by Mondelez International, a company that produces a wide range of food products, some of which may contain gluten. However, Mondelez International has stated that Swedish Fish are produced in facilities that are dedicated to gluten-free production, minimizing the risk of cross-contamination. Additionally, Swedish Fish are certified gluten-free by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO), which requires products to contain less than 10 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</p>

    <h2>Certifications and Labels</h2>

    <p>When it comes to gluten-free products, certifications and labels can provide additional assurance. Swedish Fish carry the GFCO certification, which is one of the most recognized and trusted gluten-free certifications in the industry. This certification indicates that the product has been rigorously tested and meets strict gluten-free standards.</p>

    <p>In addition to the GFCO certification, Swedish Fish packaging also includes a "gluten-free" label, making it easy for consumers to identify the product as safe for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>
