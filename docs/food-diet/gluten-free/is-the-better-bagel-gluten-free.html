<h1>Is the Better Bagel Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Bagels have long been a breakfast staple, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a traditional bagel can be a challenge. Enter the "Better Bagel," a product that has been gaining attention for its health-conscious approach. But is the Better Bagel truly gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about the Better Bagel, its ingredients, nutritional profile, and whether it’s a safe option for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>What is the Better Bagel?</h2>

<p>The Better Bagel is a modern take on the classic bagel, designed to cater to health-conscious consumers. It boasts a high-protein, low-carb profile, making it an attractive option for those following ketogenic, low-carb, or high-protein diets. Unlike traditional bagels, which are made primarily from wheat flour, the Better Bagel uses alternative ingredients to achieve its unique texture and nutritional benefits.</p>

<h2>Ingredients and Nutritional Profile</h2>

<p>Understanding the ingredients of the Better Bagel is crucial to determining whether it’s gluten-free. Here’s a breakdown of its key components:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Ingredient</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Almond Flour</td>
            <td>Provides a gluten-free base and adds healthy fats.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Egg Whites</td>
            <td>Contribute to the high protein content and help bind the ingredients.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Psyllium Husk</td>
            <td>Adds fiber and helps create a chewy texture similar to traditional bagels.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Baking Powder</td>
            <td>Acts as a leavening agent to help the bagels rise.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Salt</td>
            <td>Enhances flavor.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>From this list, it’s clear that the Better Bagel does not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, it’s important to consider cross-contamination risks, especially if the product is manufactured in a facility that also processes wheat or other gluten-containing grains.</p>

<h2>Is the Better Bagel Certified Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>While the Better Bagel does not contain gluten ingredients, it’s essential to check whether it is certified gluten-free. Certification ensures that the product has been tested and meets strict gluten-free standards, typically containing less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. As of now, the Better Bagel is not certified gluten-free, which means there could be a risk of cross-contamination during production.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Comparison: Better Bagel vs. Traditional Bagel</h2>

<p>To better understand the Better Bagel’s appeal, let’s compare its nutritional profile to that of a traditional bagel:</p>

<table>

            <th>Better Bagel (1 bagel)</th>
            <th>Traditional Bagel (1 bagel)</th>
        </tr>

            <td>25g</td>
            <td>10g</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Carbohydrates</td>
            <td>9g</td>
            <td>56g</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Fiber</td>
            <td>7g</td>
            <td>2g</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
