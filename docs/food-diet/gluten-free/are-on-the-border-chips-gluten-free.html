    <h1>Are On The Border Chips Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>When it comes to enjoying a delicious snack, especially one that complements your favorite dips and salsas, On The Border chips are a popular choice. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether these chips are gluten-free is of utmost importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential cross-contamination risks associated with On The Border chips to determine if they are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and production processes of the foods they consume.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in On The Border Chips</h2>

    <p>On The Border chips are primarily made from corn, which is naturally gluten-free. However, the presence of other ingredients and the risk of cross-contamination during manufacturing can affect their gluten-free status. Let's take a closer look at the typical ingredients found in On The Border chips:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Corn</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vegetable Oil</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Seasonings</td>
                <td>Varies</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>While the base ingredients of On The Border chips are gluten-free, the seasonings used can sometimes contain gluten or be processed in facilities that handle gluten-containing products. It is essential to check the specific product packaging for any allergen warnings or gluten-related information.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients in On The Border chips are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can pose a risk. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free products come into contact with gluten-containing products or surfaces during production. This can happen in facilities that process both gluten-free and gluten-containing foods.</p>

    <p>On The Border chips are produced in facilities that may also handle wheat and other gluten-containing ingredients. Therefore, there is a potential risk of cross-contamination. For individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, this risk may be significant enough to avoid consuming these chips unless they are certified gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Certified Gluten-Free Products</h2>

    <p>For those who require a strict gluten-free diet, certified gluten-free products are the safest option. These products have been tested and verified to contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease. Unfortunately, On The Border chips are not certified gluten-free, which means they may not meet this stringent standard.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, while On The Border chips are made from gluten-free ingredients like corn, the potential for cross-contamination and the lack of gluten-free certification make them a less safe option for individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivities.
