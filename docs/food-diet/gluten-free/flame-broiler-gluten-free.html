    <table>

            <tr>
                <th>Menu Item</th>
                <th>Contains Gluten</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>

        <li><strong>Choose Simple Bowls:</strong> Opt for bowls with fewer ingredients to reduce the risk of cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Shared Fryers:</strong> If you’re ordering any fried items, make sure they’re not cooked in the same fryer as gluten-containing foods.</li>
