<p>As seen in the table above, the primary ingredients in Potato Oles are naturally gluten-free. However, it's important to note that the gluten-free status of a product is not solely determined by its ingredients. Cross-contamination during preparation and cooking can also pose a risk.</p>

<h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

<p>Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods or surfaces. In the case of Potato Oles, cross-contamination can happen in several ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Shared Fryers:</strong> Many fast-food restaurants use the same fryers for cooking gluten-free items like Potato Oles and gluten-containing items like breaded chicken or onion rings. This shared equipment can lead to cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Preparation Surfaces:</strong> If the same surfaces or utensils are used for preparing gluten-free and gluten-containing foods without proper cleaning, cross-contamination can occur.</li>
    <li><strong>Seasoning Blends:</strong> While the individual spices in Potato Oles are typically gluten-free, some seasoning blends may contain additives or anti-caking agents that contain gluten.</li>
</ul>

<p>To minimize the risk of cross-contamination, it's crucial to inquire about the preparation methods at the specific restaurant or establishment where you are purchasing Potato Oles. Some restaurants may have dedicated fryers or preparation areas for gluten-free items, while others may not.</p>

<h2>Are Potato Oles at Taco John's Gluten-Free?</h2>

However, they also caution that cross-contamination can occur in their kitchens. According to Taco John's, their Potato Oles are cooked in a shared fryer, which means there is a risk of cross-contamination with gluten-containing items. Therefore, while the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, the final product may not be safe for individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivities.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Potato Oles</h2>

<p>If you are concerned about cross-contamination or simply prefer to avoid fast-food options, there are several gluten-free alternatives to Potato Oles that you can prepare at home. Here are a few ideas:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Homemade Potato Oles:</strong> You can make your own Potato Oles at home using gluten-free ingredients and a dedicated fryer or air fryer to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Baked Potato Wedges:</strong> Season potato wedges with your favorite spices and bake them in the oven for a healthier, gluten-free alternative.</li>
    <li><strong>Sweet Potato Fries:</strong> Sweet potatoes are naturally gluten-free and can be cut into fries, seasoned, and baked or fried for a delicious side dish.</li>
