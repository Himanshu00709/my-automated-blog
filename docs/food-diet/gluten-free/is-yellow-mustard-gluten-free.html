    <p>As you can see, the primary ingredients in yellow mustard are naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that some brands may add additional ingredients or use processing methods that could introduce gluten. Always check the label for any hidden sources of gluten.</p>

    <h2>Is Yellow Mustard Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>In most cases, yellow mustard is gluten-free. The core ingredients—mustard seeds, vinegar, water, turmeric, and spices—do not contain gluten. However, there are a few factors to consider:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> Some mustard brands may be produced in facilities that also process gluten-containing products, which could lead to cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Added Ingredients:</strong> Certain brands may include additives or flavorings that contain gluten. Always read the ingredient list carefully.</li>
        <li><strong>Vinegar Source:</strong> While most vinegar is gluten-free, some types, like malt vinegar, are derived from gluten-containing grains. Most yellow mustards use distilled vinegar, which is safe, but it’s worth verifying.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To ensure that the yellow mustard you’re consuming is gluten-free, look for products that are certified gluten-free by a reputable organization. These products have been tested and verified to meet strict gluten-free standards.</p>
