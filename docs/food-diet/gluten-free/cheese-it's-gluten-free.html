<h1>Is Cheese Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Cheese is a beloved food item enjoyed by millions around the world. Whether it's melted on a pizza, sprinkled over pasta, or enjoyed on its own, cheese is a versatile and delicious ingredient. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Is cheese gluten-free? In this article, we'll explore the gluten-free status of cheese, the types of cheese you can safely enjoy, and what to watch out for when selecting cheese products.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It acts as a binding agent, giving dough its elasticity and helping it rise. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications.</p>

<h2>Is Cheese Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Most cheeses are naturally gluten-free. Cheese is made from milk, which does not contain gluten. The basic ingredients in cheese are milk, salt, and enzymes (such as rennet). These ingredients are gluten-free, so in their purest form, cheeses like cheddar, mozzarella, and Swiss are safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<p>However, not all cheeses are created equal. Some cheeses may contain additives or be processed in ways that introduce gluten. For example, certain flavored cheeses or cheese spreads may include gluten-containing ingredients. Additionally, cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing, so it's essential to read labels carefully.</p>
