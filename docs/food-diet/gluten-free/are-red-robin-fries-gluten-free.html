<h1>Are Red Robin Fries Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can be a challenge. One of the most common questions that arise is whether popular restaurant items, like Red Robin fries, are gluten-free. In this article, we will delve into the details of Red Robin's fries, their ingredients, preparation methods, and whether they are safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including damage to the small intestine. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, ingesting gluten can cause discomfort and other symptoms. Therefore, it's crucial to know whether the foods you consume are free from gluten.</p>

<h2>Red Robin Fries: Ingredients and Preparation</h2>

<p>Red Robin is a popular restaurant chain known for its gourmet burgers and bottomless steak fries. But are these fries gluten-free? Let's break it down:</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<p>According to Red Robin's official website, their steak fries are made from whole potatoes, vegetable oil, and a blend of seasonings. The primary ingredients are naturally gluten-free. However, the concern often lies in the preparation process and potential cross-contamination.</p>

<h3>Preparation Process</h3>

<p>Red Robin fries are typically cooked in a shared fryer. This means that the same oil used to cook gluten-containing items, such as breaded chicken or onion rings, is also used to cook the fries. Cross-contamination can occur in this shared environment, making the fries potentially unsafe for those with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>

<h2>Red Robin's Gluten-Free Options</h2>

<p>Red Robin offers a variety of gluten-free options, including burgers with gluten-free buns and salads. However, when it comes to fries, the risk of cross-contamination is a significant concern. The restaurant does provide a gluten-free menu, but it explicitly states that the fries are not considered gluten-free due to the shared fryer issue.</p>

<h2>What Do Experts Say?</h2>

<p>Nutritionists and dietitians often advise individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity to avoid foods cooked in shared fryers. Even trace amounts of gluten can trigger symptoms and cause long-term damage. Therefore, while the ingredients in Red Robin fries are gluten-free, the preparation method makes them unsuitable for those who need to strictly avoid gluten.</p>

<h2>Alternatives to Red Robin Fries</h2>

<p>If you're dining at Red Robin and need to avoid gluten, there are several alternatives to consider:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Gluten-Free Buns:</strong> Red Robin offers gluten-free buns for their burgers, which are prepared separately to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Salads:</strong> Many of Red Robin's salads can be made gluten-free by omitting croutons and choosing a gluten-free dressing.</li>
    <li><strong>Other Sides:</strong> Consider other gluten-free sides like steamed broccoli or a side salad.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Red Robin Fries and Gluten</h2>

    <h3>2. Can I request Red Robin to cook my fries in a separate fryer?</h3>
    <p>Red Robin does not typically offer the option to cook fries in a separate fryer. It's best to choose a different side dish if you need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h3>3. What other gluten-free options does Red Robin offer?</h3>
    <p>Red Robin offers a variety of gluten-free options, including burgers with gluten-free buns, salads, and certain sides like steamed broccoli.</p>

    <h3>4. Is there a risk of cross-contamination with other gluten-free items at Red Robin?</h3>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, while Red Robin fries are made from gluten-free ingredients, they are not considered safe for those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity due to the risk of cross-contamination in shared fryers. If you need to avoid gluten, it's best to opt for other gluten-free options available at Red Robin, such as their gluten-free buns or salads.
