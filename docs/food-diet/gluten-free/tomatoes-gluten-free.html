    <h1>Tomatoes and Gluten-Free Living: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Tomatoes are a staple in many diets around the world, celebrated for their versatility, nutritional benefits, and vibrant flavor. For individuals following a gluten-free diet, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, understanding the role of tomatoes in their diet is essential.

For example, canned tomato products, sauces, or soups may contain additives or thickeners that include gluten. Therefore, it is crucial to read labels carefully when purchasing processed tomato products.</p>
