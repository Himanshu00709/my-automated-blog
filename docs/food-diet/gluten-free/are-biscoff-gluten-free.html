    <h1>Are Biscoff Cookies Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Biscoff cookies, also known as Speculoos, have gained immense popularity worldwide due to their unique caramelized flavor and crunchy texture. Originating from Belgium, these cookies are often enjoyed with coffee or used as a base for desserts. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Are Biscoff cookies gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and alternatives to help you make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and long-term complications like osteoporosis or neurological disorders. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize the ingredients of any food product, including Biscoff cookies.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Biscoff Cookies</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Biscoff cookies are gluten-free, we must first examine their ingredients. The traditional Biscoff cookie recipe includes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Wheat flour</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Vegetable oils (palm, rapeseed)</li>
        <li>Candy syrup</li>
        <li>Leavening agents (sodium bicarbonate, ammonium bicarbonate)</li>
        <li>Soy flour</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As you can see, <strong>wheat flour</strong> is a primary ingredient in Biscoff cookies. Wheat flour contains gluten, which means that traditional Biscoff cookies are <strong>not gluten-free</strong>. This is a critical consideration for anyone following a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if a product does not contain gluten-containing ingredients, cross-contamination during manufacturing can pose a risk. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free products come into contact with gluten-containing products or surfaces. This can happen during the production, packaging, or transportation of food items.</p>

    <p>Biscoff cookies are manufactured in facilities that also process other products containing gluten. Therefore, there is a risk of cross-contamination, which could make even trace amounts of gluten present in the cookies. For individuals with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease, this is a significant concern.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Biscoff Cookies</h2>

    <p>If you are a fan of Biscoff cookies but need to avoid gluten, there are several gluten-free alternatives available in the market. These alternatives mimic the flavor and texture of traditional Biscoff cookies while being safe for those with gluten intolerance. Here are some popular options:</p>
