                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>

    <p>As you can see, the primary ingredients in Shack Sauce are naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that some spices or additives could potentially contain gluten, depending on the manufacturer. Additionally, cross-contamination during production could be a concern for those with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Is Shack Sauce Certified Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>While the ingredients in Shack Sauce are generally gluten-free, it’s not officially certified as gluten-free by any recognized organization.

Even if a product’s ingredients are gluten-free, the risk of contamination during manufacturing, packaging, or even in the kitchen can pose a threat. Shake Shack kitchens handle a variety of gluten-containing products, such as buns and fried items, which increases the risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>If you’re highly sensitive to gluten, it’s essential to communicate your dietary needs to the staff at Shake Shack. While they may not be able to guarantee a completely gluten-free environment, they can take precautions to minimize the risk of cross-contamination.</p>
