<h1>Gluten-Free Swaps: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Adopting a gluten-free lifestyle can be a significant change, especially if you're used to consuming gluten-containing foods regularly. Whether you're managing celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply choosing to avoid gluten for health reasons, finding suitable substitutes is essential. This guide will walk you through the best gluten-free swaps for common foods, ensuring you don't miss out on your favorite dishes while maintaining a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even for those without celiac disease, gluten can cause discomfort, bloating, and other digestive issues. A gluten-free diet can help alleviate these symptoms and improve overall well-being.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Swaps for Common Foods</h2>

<p>Transitioning to a gluten-free diet doesn't mean you have to give up your favorite foods. Here are some excellent gluten-free alternatives for common gluten-containing foods:</p>
