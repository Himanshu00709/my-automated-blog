    <h1>Marmite Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Marmite, the iconic British spread, has been a staple in households for over a century. Known for its unique, umami-rich flavor, Marmite is a polarizing food product—people either love it or hate it. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying Marmite has historically been a challenge due to its gluten content. Enter Marmite Gluten-Free, a game-changer for gluten-sensitive individuals who still want to enjoy the distinctive taste of this beloved spread.

    <p>The taste and texture of Marmite Gluten-Free are virtually identical to the original, ensuring that fans of the spread won’t miss out on its unique flavor. It’s still rich in B vitamins, including B12, and offers the same savory, umami-packed experience that Marmite lovers crave.</p>
