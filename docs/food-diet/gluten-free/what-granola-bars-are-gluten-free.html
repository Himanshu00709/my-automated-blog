    <h1>Gluten-Free Granola Bars: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Granola bars are a popular snack choice for people on the go, offering a convenient and nutritious option for busy lifestyles. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding gluten-free granola bars can be a challenge. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe health issues for those who cannot tolerate it. In this article, we will explore what makes granola bars gluten-free, highlight some of the best options available, and provide tips for making your own gluten-free granola bars at home.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Granola Bar Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>A granola bar is considered gluten-free if it does not contain any ingredients derived from wheat, barley, rye, or their derivatives. This means that the oats, nuts, seeds, and other components used in the granola bar must be certified gluten-free. Oats, in particular, are often a point of concern because they can be cross-contaminated with gluten during processing. Therefore, it is essential to look for granola bars that use oats specifically labeled as gluten-free.</p>

    <p>Additionally, gluten-free granola bars should be produced in a facility that avoids cross-contamination with gluten-containing products. Many manufacturers now offer gluten-free certifications on their packaging to assure consumers that their products meet strict gluten-free standards.</p>
