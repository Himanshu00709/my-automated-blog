<h1>Are Stonemill Spices Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and the general trend toward healthier eating. For those who must adhere to a gluten-free diet, even the smallest trace of gluten can cause significant health issues. This has led many to scrutinize the ingredients in their pantry staples, including spices. One brand that often comes under the spotlight is Stonemill Spices. In this article, we will delve into whether Stonemill Spices are gluten-free, what to look for when purchasing spices, and how to ensure your kitchen remains a safe haven for gluten-free cooking.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune responses. Even trace amounts of gluten can be harmful, making it crucial for those affected to carefully monitor their diet.</p>

This lack of certification can be a point of concern for those who are highly sensitive to gluten.</p>
