    <h1>Are Five Guys Fries Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Five Guys is a popular fast-food chain known for its delicious burgers and fries. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Five Guys fries are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, preparation methods, and potential cross-contamination risks to determine if Five Guys fries are safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it's essential for these individuals to be vigilant about the foods they consume, especially when dining out.</p>

    <h2>Five Guys Fries: Ingredients and Preparation</h2>

    <p>Five Guys prides itself on using simple, high-quality ingredients. Their fries are made from fresh, hand-cut potatoes and cooked in 100% peanut oil. The ingredients list for Five Guys fries is straightforward:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Peanut Oil</li>
        <li>Salt (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, these ingredients are naturally gluten-free. However, the preparation process is where potential issues may arise.</p>

    <h3>Cross-Contamination Risks</h3>

    <p>While the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination is a significant concern in any restaurant setting. Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free foods come into contact with surfaces, utensils, or fryers that have been used to prepare gluten-containing foods.</p>

    <p>At Five Guys, the fries are cooked in dedicated fryers that are separate from those used for other menu items, such as chicken or breaded items. This significantly reduces the risk of cross-contamination. However, it's important to note that Five Guys does not claim to be a gluten-free establishment, and there is always a possibility of trace amounts of gluten being present.</p>
