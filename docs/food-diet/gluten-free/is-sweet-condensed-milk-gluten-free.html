<h1>Is Sweetened Condensed Milk Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>Sweetened condensed milk is a staple in many kitchens, often used in desserts, beverages, and even savory dishes. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether sweetened condensed milk is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential risks associated with sweetened condensed milk to determine if it’s safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What is Sweetened Condensed Milk?</h2>

<p>Sweetened condensed milk is a thick, creamy product made by removing most of the water from cow’s milk and adding sugar.
