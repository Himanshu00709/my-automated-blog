    <h1>Gluten-Free Bountiful: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the gluten-free diet has gained immense popularity, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle. Gluten-free bountiful refers to the abundance of gluten-free foods and products available today, making it easier than ever to maintain a gluten-free diet without sacrificing taste or nutrition. This guide will explore the benefits of a gluten-free diet, the variety of gluten-free foods available, and tips for living a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to various health issues. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy are other conditions that may necessitate a gluten-free diet. However, many people choose to go gluten-free for its potential health benefits, such as improved digestion, increased energy levels, and reduced inflammation.</p>

    <h2>The Gluten-Free Bountiful: A World of Options</h2>

    <p>Gone are the days when gluten-free diets were limited to a few bland options. Today, the gluten-free market is thriving, offering a wide range of delicious and nutritious foods. Here are some categories of gluten-free foods that you can enjoy:</p>
