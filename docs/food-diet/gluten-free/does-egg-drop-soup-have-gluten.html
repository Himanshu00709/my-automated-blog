    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Egg Drop Soup</h2>

    <p>While many of the core ingredients in egg drop soup are naturally gluten-free, there are a few potential sources of gluten that you need to be aware of:</p>

    <h3>1. Soy Sauce</h3>

    <p>Soy sauce is a common seasoning in egg drop soup, but traditional soy sauce is made from fermented soybeans and wheat, which contains gluten. If you are sensitive to gluten or have celiac disease, it's essential to use a gluten-free soy sauce or tamari, which is a gluten-free alternative made without wheat.</p>

    <h3>2. Broth</h3>

    <p>While chicken or vegetable broth is typically gluten-free, some commercially prepared broths may contain additives or flavorings that include gluten. Always check the label to ensure the broth is certified gluten-free.</p>

    <h3>3. Thickeners</h3>

    <p>Some recipes may call for thickeners like cornstarch, which is gluten-free. However, if a recipe uses flour or another thickening agent, it could introduce gluten into the soup. Always verify the ingredients used in the thickening process.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Egg Drop Soup</h2>

    <p>If you're preparing egg drop soup at home and want to ensure it's gluten-free, follow these steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use Gluten-Free Broth:</strong> Choose a broth that is labeled gluten-free or make your own at home using fresh ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Substitute Soy Sauce:</strong> Replace traditional soy sauce with a gluten-free soy sauce or tamari.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Thickeners:</strong> Use cornstarch or another gluten-free thickening agent if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Cross-Contamination:</strong> Ensure that all utensils, pots, and surfaces are clean and free from gluten-containing residues.</li>
    </ol>
