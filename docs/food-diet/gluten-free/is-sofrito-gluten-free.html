<p>As you can see, the core ingredients of sofrito are naturally gluten-free. However, the potential for gluten contamination arises when using pre-made sofrito or when additional ingredients are added during preparation.</p>

<h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Sofrito</h2>

<p>While the base ingredients of sofrito are gluten-free, there are a few scenarios where gluten might sneak in:</p>

    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If sofrito is prepared in a kitchen that also handles gluten-containing foods, there’s a risk of cross-contamination. This is especially important for individuals with celiac disease.</li>
    <li><strong>Additional Ingredients:</strong> Some recipes may call for ingredients like soy sauce or broth, which can contain gluten unless specifically labeled gluten-free.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Stick to fresh vegetables, herbs, and spices to avoid any hidden gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Read Labels Carefully:</strong> If using store-bought sofrito or additional ingredients like broth or sauces, always check for gluten-free certifications or labels.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid Cross-Contamination:</strong> Use clean utensils, cutting boards, and cookware when preparing sofrito. If you’re sharing a kitchen, designate gluten-free zones.</li>
    <li><strong>Make Your Own Sofrito:</strong> Preparing sofrito from scratch is the safest way to ensure it’s gluten-free. Plus, you can customize it to your taste!</li>
