    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Yellow Curry</h2>

    <p>While many of the core ingredients in yellow curry are naturally gluten-free, there are a few potential sources of gluten that you need to be aware of:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Soy Sauce:</strong> Traditional soy sauce is made with wheat, making it a common source of gluten in many Asian dishes. If your yellow curry recipe calls for soy sauce, be sure to use a gluten-free alternative like tamari.</li>
        <li><strong>Curry Paste:</strong> Some pre-made curry pastes may contain gluten as a thickening agent or flavor enhancer. Always read the label carefully or make your own curry paste at home to ensure it's gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Thickeners:</strong> Some recipes may use flour or other thickeners that contain gluten. Cornstarch or arrowroot powder can be used as gluten-free alternatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If you're dining out or using shared kitchen equipment, there's a risk of cross-contamination with gluten-containing ingredients. Always communicate your dietary needs to the chef or restaurant staff.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Yellow Curry</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free yellow curry at home is relatively straightforward if you use the right ingredients. Hereâ€™s a simple guide to ensure your yellow curry is gluten-free:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Choose Gluten-Free Ingredients:</strong> Start by selecting gluten-free spices, coconut milk, and any other base ingredients. If you're using a pre-made curry paste, check the label to ensure it's gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Substitute Soy Sauce:</strong> Replace traditional soy sauce with a gluten-free alternative like tamari or coconut aminos.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Thickeners with Gluten:</strong> If your recipe calls for a thickener, opt for gluten-free options like cornstarch or arrowroot powder.</li>
