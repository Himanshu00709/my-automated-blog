    <h1>Shoyu Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Shoyu, a traditional Japanese soy sauce, has been a staple in Asian cuisine for centuries. Known for its rich umami flavor, shoyu is made from fermented soybeans, wheat, salt, and water. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the presence of wheat in traditional shoyu can be problematic. This has led to the development of gluten-free shoyu, a safe and delicious alternative for those who need to avoid gluten. In this article, we will explore the world of gluten-free shoyu, its benefits, how it's made, and how you can incorporate it into your diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Shoyu?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free shoyu is a type of soy sauce that is made without wheat, making it safe for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Traditional shoyu contains wheat as a key ingredient, which is used to help ferment the soybeans and develop the sauce's characteristic flavor. However, gluten-free shoyu substitutes wheat with other grains or ingredients that do not contain gluten, such as rice or millet. The result is a soy sauce that retains the rich, savory flavor of traditional shoyu but is safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>How is Gluten-Free Shoyu Made?</h2>

    <p>The process of making gluten-free shoyu is similar to that of traditional shoyu, with a few key differences. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how gluten-free shoyu is produced:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Step</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1. Ingredient Selection</td>
                <td>Instead of using wheat, gluten-free shoyu is made with alternative grains like rice or millet. These grains are chosen for their ability to ferment and develop flavor without introducing gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2. Fermentation</td>
                <td>The soybeans and alternative grains are mixed with a culture of Aspergillus oryzae, a type of mold that helps break down the proteins and carbohydrates in the ingredients. This fermentation process can take several months and is crucial for developing the sauce's flavor.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3. Pressing and Filtering</td>
                <td>After fermentation, the mixture is pressed to extract the liquid, which is then filtered to remove any solids. The resulting liquid is the raw soy sauce.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4. Pasteurization</td>
                <td>The raw soy sauce is heated to kill any remaining microorganisms and stabilize the flavor. This step also helps to extend the shelf life of the product.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5. Bottling</td>
                <td>The final product is bottled and ready for consumption. Some brands may add additional ingredients, such as salt or sugar, to enhance the flavor.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
