    <h1>Gluten-Free Filo: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Filo pastry, known for its delicate, flaky layers, is a staple in many cuisines around the world. However, for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, traditional filo pastry is off the menu due to its wheat-based composition. Enter gluten-free filo—a game-changer for those who need to avoid gluten but still want to enjoy the culinary delights that filo pastry offers. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free filo, from its ingredients and preparation to its uses and benefits.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Filo?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free filo is a type of pastry that mimics the texture and functionality of traditional filo but is made without gluten-containing ingredients. Instead of wheat flour, gluten-free filo is typically made from a blend of alternative flours such as rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch. These ingredients help to create the thin, layered sheets that are characteristic of filo pastry, while ensuring that the product is safe for those with gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients and Preparation</h2>

    <p>The key to making gluten-free filo lies in the choice of ingredients and the preparation method. Here’s a breakdown of the common ingredients used in gluten-free filo:</p>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Tapioca Starch</td>
                <td>Adds elasticity and helps bind the dough.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Potato Starch</td>
                <td>Contributes to the flaky texture.</td>

            <tr>
