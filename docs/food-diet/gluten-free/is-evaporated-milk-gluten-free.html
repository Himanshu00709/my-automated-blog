    <h1>Is Evaporated Milk Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Evaporated milk is a staple in many kitchens, known for its rich, creamy texture and versatility in both sweet and savory dishes. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether evaporated milk is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free status of evaporated milk, how it’s made, and what to look for when purchasing it. We’ll also address common questions and provide a comprehensive guide to help you make informed decisions.</p>

    <h2>What is Evaporated Milk?</h2>

    <p>Evaporated milk is a concentrated form of milk where about 60% of the water content has been removed through a heating process. This results in a thicker, creamier product that can be stored for longer periods without refrigeration until opened. It’s commonly used in recipes like custards, soups, and sauces, and can even be reconstituted with water to mimic regular milk.</p>

    <h2>Is Evaporated Milk Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Milk, in its pure form, is naturally gluten-free. Since evaporated milk is simply concentrated milk, it should also be gluten-free. However, the gluten-free status of evaporated milk can depend on the manufacturing process and any additional ingredients that may be added. Cross-contamination during production is another factor to consider, especially if the facility also processes gluten-containing products.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients in Evaporated Milk</h3>

    <p>Most brands of evaporated milk contain only two ingredients: milk and a stabilizer like dipotassium phosphate. These ingredients are inherently gluten-free. However, it’s always important to check the label for any additives or flavorings that might contain gluten.</p>
