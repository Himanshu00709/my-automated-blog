<h1>Are Goldfish Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Goldfish crackers are a beloved snack for many, known for their cheesy flavor and fun fish shape. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Goldfish are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and alternatives to help you determine if Goldfish crackers are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What Are Goldfish Crackers Made Of?</h2>

<p>Goldfish crackers are primarily made from wheat flour, which contains gluten. The main ingredients include enriched wheat flour, cheddar cheese, vegetable oils, and various seasonings. Since wheat is a primary ingredient, traditional Goldfish crackers are not gluten-free. However, the brand has introduced a gluten-free version to cater to those with dietary restrictions.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Goldfish: A New Option</h2>

<p>In response to the growing demand for gluten-free products, Pepperidge Farm, the manufacturer of Goldfish crackers, launched a gluten-free version. These crackers are made with alternative flours such as rice flour and cornstarch, ensuring they are safe for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

<h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

<p>Even though gluten-free Goldfish crackers are made with alternative ingredients, there is still a risk of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process. Pepperidge Farm states that they take precautions to prevent cross-contamination, but they do not guarantee that their gluten-free products are entirely free from gluten traces. If you have severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease, it’s essential to consider this risk.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Comparison</h2>

<p>When comparing traditional Goldfish crackers to their gluten-free counterparts, there are some nutritional differences. Gluten-free Goldfish crackers may have slightly different calorie counts, fat content, and fiber levels due to the use of alternative flours. Here’s a quick comparison:</p>
