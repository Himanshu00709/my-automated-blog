    <h1>Are Mentos Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Mentos, the iconic chewy candy, has been a favorite treat for many around the world. Known for its refreshing flavors and unique texture, Mentos is often a go-to snack for people of all ages.

In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of Mentos, explore their gluten-free status, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize the ingredients of any food product they consume.</p>

    <h2>Are Mentos Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, Mentos are generally considered gluten-free. The primary ingredients in Mentos include sugar, glucose syrup, hydrogenated coconut oil, fruit juices, and natural flavors.
