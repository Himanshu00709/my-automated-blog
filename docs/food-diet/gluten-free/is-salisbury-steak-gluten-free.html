<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Salisbury Steak</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free Salisbury steak is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating a delicious, gluten-free version of this classic dish:</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
    <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1/2 cup gluten-free breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 cups gluten-free beef broth</li>
    <li>2 tbsp cornstarch (for thickening)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, chopped onion, egg, gluten-free breadcrumbs, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
    <li>Shape the mixture into oval patties, about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
