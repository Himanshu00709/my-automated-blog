    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Salisbury Steak</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free version of Salisbury steak is entirely possible with a few substitutions. Here’s how you can do it:</p>

    <h3>1. Use Gluten-Free Breadcrumbs</h3>
    <p>Instead of traditional breadcrumbs, opt for gluten-free breadcrumbs made from rice, corn, or other gluten-free grains. These are widely available in most grocery stores.</p>

    <h3>2. Choose Gluten-Free Worcestershire Sauce</h3>
    <p>Look for Worcestershire sauce that is labeled gluten-free. Many brands now offer gluten-free versions, or you can make your own at home using gluten-free ingredients.</p>

    <h3>3. Use Gluten-Free Flour for the Gravy</h3>
    <p>Replace regular flour with gluten-free flour blends, such as those made from rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca starch. These can be used to thicken the gravy without introducing gluten.</p>

    <h3>4. Check the Beef Broth</h3>
    <p>Ensure that the beef broth you use is gluten-free. Some broths may contain additives or flavorings that include gluten. Always read the label carefully.</p>
