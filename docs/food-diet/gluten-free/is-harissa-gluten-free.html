    <p>As seen in the table above, the core ingredients of harissa are naturally gluten-free. However, some brands may include additives or use processing methods that introduce gluten. For example, vinegar derived from gluten-containing grains or cross-contamination during manufacturing can pose a risk.</p>

    <h2>Is Harissa Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The answer to whether harissa is gluten-free depends on the specific brand and product. While traditional harissa recipes are gluten-free, commercially produced harissa may not always be safe for those with gluten sensitivities. Here are some factors to consider:</p>

    <h3>1. Ingredient List</h3>
    <p>Always read the ingredient list carefully. Look for any hidden sources of gluten, such as modified food starch, malt vinegar, or flavorings that may contain gluten. If the product contains vinegar, ensure it’s derived from gluten-free sources like distilled vinegar.</p>

    <h3>2. Cross-Contamination</h3>
    <p>Cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process if the harissa is produced in a facility that also processes gluten-containing products. Look for labels that indicate the product is made in a dedicated gluten-free facility or has been tested for gluten.</p>

    <h3>3. Gluten-Free Certification</h3>
    <p>To ensure the harissa is gluten-free, opt for brands that carry a gluten-free certification from recognized organizations. This certification guarantees that the product meets strict gluten-free standards and has been tested for gluten content.</p>
