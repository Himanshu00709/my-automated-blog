    <p>As you can see, the primary ingredients in Charms Mini Pops are naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that while the ingredients themselves may be gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing could still pose a risk.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients in a product are gluten-free, cross-contamination during the manufacturing process can introduce gluten into the final product. This is a significant concern for individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <p>Charms Mini Pops are manufactured in facilities that also produce other products, some of which may contain gluten. While the company takes precautions to prevent cross-contamination, there is always a risk when multiple products are made in the same facility. It’s essential to check the packaging for any warnings about shared equipment or facilities.</p>

    <h2>Certifications and Labeling</h2>

    <p>One way to ensure that a product is gluten-free is to look for certifications from reputable organizations. Unfortunately, Charms Mini Pops do not carry a gluten-free certification from organizations like the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). However, the absence of a certification does not necessarily mean that the product contains gluten.</p>

    <p>It’s also important to read the product label carefully. Some manufacturers voluntarily label their products as gluten-free if they meet the FDA’s criteria for gluten-free labeling (less than 20 parts per million of gluten). If Charms Mini Pops are labeled as gluten-free, this would be a strong indication that they are safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>
