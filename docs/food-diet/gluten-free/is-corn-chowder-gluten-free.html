<h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Corn Chowder</h2>

<p>While many of the primary ingredients in corn chowder are naturally gluten-free, there are a few key areas where gluten can sneak in:</p>

However, it’s possible to make a gluten-free roux using alternative flours such as rice flour, cornstarch, or gluten-free all-purpose flour.</p>

<h3>2. Stock or Broth</h3>

<p>Many store-bought stocks or broths contain additives or flavorings that may include gluten. It’s important to read labels carefully or opt for brands that are certified gluten-free. Alternatively, you can make your own stock at home to ensure it’s free from gluten.</p>

<h3>3. Bacon or Other Processed Meats</h3>

<p>Bacon is a common ingredient in corn chowder, but some brands may include gluten-containing additives or flavorings. Always check the label or choose bacon that is labeled gluten-free.</p>

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Corn Chowder</h2>
