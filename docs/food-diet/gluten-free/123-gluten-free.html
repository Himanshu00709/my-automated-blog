    <h2>Benefits of a Gluten-Free Diet</h2>

    <p>While a gluten-free diet is essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, many people choose to go gluten-free for other health reasons. Here are some potential benefits of a gluten-free diet:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Digestive Health:</strong> For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, eliminating gluten can lead to significant improvements in digestive health, reducing symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Energy Levels:</strong> Some people report feeling more energetic and less fatigued after adopting a gluten-free diet, especially if they were previously consuming gluten without realizing it was causing them discomfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Nutrient Absorption:</strong> In individuals with celiac disease, gluten can damage the lining of the small intestine, impairing nutrient absorption. A gluten-free diet can help restore intestinal health and improve nutrient absorption.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight Management:</strong> While a gluten-free diet is not inherently a weight-loss diet, some people find that eliminating gluten helps them make healthier food choices, leading to weight loss or better weight management.</li>
