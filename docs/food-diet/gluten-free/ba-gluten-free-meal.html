    <h1>Gluten-Free Meals: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free meals has skyrocketed, driven by both medical necessity and lifestyle choices. Whether you're managing celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply exploring a healthier diet, understanding how to create balanced, nutritious, and delicious gluten-free meals is essential. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about gluten-free eating, from the basics to advanced meal planning.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy are other conditions that may necessitate a gluten-free diet. Additionally, some people choose to go gluten-free for perceived health benefits, such as improved digestion and increased energy levels.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of a Gluten-Free Diet</h2>
    <p>Adopting a gluten-free diet can offer numerous benefits, especially for those with gluten-related disorders. These benefits include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Digestive Health:</strong> Eliminating gluten can reduce symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Nutrient Absorption:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease, a gluten-free diet allows the intestines to heal, improving nutrient absorption.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Energy Levels:</strong> Many people report feeling more energetic after removing gluten from their diet.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight Management:</strong> A gluten-free diet can help with weight loss, especially when combined with whole, unprocessed foods.</li>
