    <h1>Is Kraft Grated Parmesan Cheese Gluten-Free?</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, ensuring that the foods they consume are gluten-free is crucial. One common question that arises is whether Kraft Grated Parmesan Cheese is gluten-free. This blog post will delve into the details, examining the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential cross-contamination risks associated with Kraft Grated Parmesan Cheese.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including damage to the small intestine, nutrient malabsorption, and a host of other symptoms. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, avoiding gluten is essential to prevent discomfort and adverse health effects.</p>

    <p>Given the prevalence of gluten in many processed foods, it's important to scrutinize product labels and understand the manufacturing processes to ensure that a product is truly gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Kraft Grated Parmesan Cheese</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Kraft Grated Parmesan Cheese is gluten-free, we first need to examine its ingredients. The primary ingredients in Kraft Grated Parmesan Cheese include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Parmesan cheese (pasteurized part-skim milk, cheese culture, salt, enzymes)</li>
        <li>Cellulose powder (to prevent caking)</li>
        <li>Potassium sorbate (to protect flavor)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it's important to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. This can happen if the same equipment is used to process both gluten-containing and gluten-free products, or if gluten-containing ingredients are present in the same facility.</p>

    <p>Kraft Foods has a reputation for being transparent about their manufacturing processes. According to Kraft, their grated Parmesan cheese is produced in facilities that also process wheat. However, they have stringent cleaning protocols in place to minimize the risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>Despite these precautions, individuals with severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease may still want to exercise caution. It's always a good idea to contact the manufacturer directly for the most up-to-date information on their gluten-free practices.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

    <p>One way to ensure that a product is gluten-free is to look for gluten-free certification on the packaging. Gluten-free certification is provided by third-party organizations that test products to ensure they meet strict gluten-free standards.</p>

    <p>As of the latest information available, Kraft Grated Parmesan Cheese does not carry a gluten-free certification. This does not necessarily mean that the product contains gluten, but it does indicate that it has not been independently verified as gluten-free by a third-party organization.</p>
