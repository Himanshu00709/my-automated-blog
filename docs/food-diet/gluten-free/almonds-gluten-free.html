    <h1>Are Almonds Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Almonds are one of the most popular nuts in the world, known for their rich flavor, versatility, and numerous health benefits. But for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether almonds are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free status of almonds, their nutritional benefits, and how to incorporate them safely into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Does Gluten-Free Mean?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in grains like wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. A gluten-free diet eliminates all sources of gluten, focusing on naturally gluten-free foods like fruits, vegetables, meats, and certain grains and nuts.</p>

    <h2>Are Almonds Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Yes, almonds are naturally gluten-free. They are a type of tree nut and do not contain any gluten proteins. However, the way almonds are processed, packaged, or flavored can sometimes introduce gluten into the product. For example, almonds coated in seasonings or processed in facilities that handle gluten-containing products may be at risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Almonds</h2>
    <p>Almonds are not only gluten-free but also packed with essential nutrients. Here’s a breakdown of their nutritional profile:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Nutrient</th>
                <th>Amount per 1 oz (28g)</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Calories</td>
                <td>164</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Protein</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Fat</td>
                <td>14g (mostly healthy monounsaturated fats)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Fiber</td>
                <td>3.5g</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vitamin E</td>
                <td>37% of the Daily Value (DV)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Magnesium</td>
