    <h1>Gluten-Free Sorrento: A Culinary Journey</h1>
    <p>Sorrento, a picturesque town on the Amalfi Coast, is renowned for its stunning views, rich history, and, of course, its delectable cuisine. For those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the idea of indulging in Italian food might seem daunting. However, Sorrento has embraced the gluten-free movement with open arms, offering a variety of safe and delicious options.

    <h2>The Gluten-Free Movement in Sorrento</h2>
    <p>Italy, the land of pasta and pizza, might not seem like the most gluten-free-friendly destination at first glance. However, the country has made significant strides in accommodating those with gluten sensitivities. Sorrento, in particular, has become a haven for gluten-free travelers. Many restaurants and cafes now offer gluten-free menus, and some establishments are entirely dedicated to gluten-free cuisine. This shift is partly due to the increasing awareness of celiac disease in Italy, where the prevalence is higher than in many other countries.</p>

    <p>Sorrento’s culinary tradition is deeply rooted in fresh, local ingredients, making it easier to adapt many dishes to a gluten-free diet. Here are some traditional Sorrento dishes that you can enjoy gluten-free:</p>

    <h3>1. Gnocchi alla Sorrentina</h3>
    <p>Gnocchi alla Sorrentina is a classic dish made with potato gnocchi, tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil.

    <h3>3. Seafood Risotto</h3>
