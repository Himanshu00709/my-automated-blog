    <p>As you can see, the primary ingredients in Snickers Peanut Butter are naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that while the ingredients themselves may not contain gluten, cross-contamination during manufacturing could still pose a risk.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if a product’s ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. This is particularly concerning for individuals with celiac disease, who must avoid even trace amounts of gluten. Snickers Peanut Butter is produced in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products, which increases the risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>Mars, the company behind Snickers, does not label Snickers Peanut Butter as gluten-free. This is likely due to the potential for cross-contamination in their manufacturing facilities. Therefore, while the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, the final product may not be safe for those with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>
