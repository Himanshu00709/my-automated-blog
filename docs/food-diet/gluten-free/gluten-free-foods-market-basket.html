<h1>Gluten-Free Foods Market Basket: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>The gluten-free food market has seen exponential growth over the past decade, driven by increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the perceived health benefits of a gluten-free diet. Whether you're a seasoned gluten-free consumer or just starting your journey, understanding the essentials of a gluten-free market basket is crucial. This guide will walk you through the key components of a gluten-free diet, highlight popular products, and provide insights into the market trends shaping this industry.</p>

<p>A gluten-free diet excludes the protein gluten, which is found in grains such as wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. This diet is essential for individuals with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder where gluten ingestion damages the small intestine. Additionally, people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity or wheat allergy may also benefit from avoiding gluten. Over the years, the gluten-free diet has gained popularity among health-conscious individuals, even those without gluten-related disorders, due to its perceived benefits in weight management and overall well-being.</p>
