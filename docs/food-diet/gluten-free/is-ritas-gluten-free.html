    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it's crucial for those affected to carefully scrutinize the ingredients of any food they consume, including frozen treats like those offered by Rita's.</p>

    <h3>Italian Ice</h3>

    <p>Rita's Italian Ice is a popular choice for those seeking a refreshing, gluten-free treat. Most flavors of Italian Ice are gluten-free, as they are made from water, sugar, and natural fruit flavors. However, it's important to note that while the ingredients themselves may be gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur in stores where gluten-containing products are also prepared. Always ask the staff about their preparation methods to ensure your safety.</p>

    <h3>Frozen Custard</h3>

    <p>Rita's Frozen Custard is another gluten-free option. Made with milk, cream, sugar, and eggs, the custard base is naturally gluten-free. However, toppings and mix-ins can introduce gluten, so it's essential to choose your additions carefully. Stick to gluten-free toppings like fresh fruit or gluten-free cookies to keep your treat safe.</p>

    <h3>Blended Treats</h3>

    <p>Blended treats like Misto Shakes and Gelati can be gluten-free, depending on the ingredients used. For example, a Gelati made with gluten-free Italian Ice and Frozen Custard would be safe. However, if you add a gluten-containing topping or mix-in, the treat would no longer be gluten-free. Always communicate with the staff to ensure that your blended treat is prepared with gluten-free components.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Concerns</h2>

    <p>Even if a product is made with gluten-free ingredients, cross-contamination can occur during preparation. This is especially true in establishments that handle both gluten-free and gluten-containing products. At Rita's, the risk of cross-contamination is present, particularly in stores that prepare items like waffle cones or baked goods that contain gluten. To minimize this risk, always inform the staff of your dietary restrictions and ask about their preparation practices.</p>
