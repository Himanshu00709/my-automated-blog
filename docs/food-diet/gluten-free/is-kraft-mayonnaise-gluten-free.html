Kraft Heinz assures consumers that their natural flavors are gluten-free, but if you have concerns, contacting the manufacturer directly is always a good idea.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>While Kraft Mayonnaise does not contain gluten ingredients, cross-contamination during manufacturing is always a potential risk. Cross-contamination can occur if gluten-containing products are processed on the same equipment as gluten-free products. Kraft Heinz states that they follow strict manufacturing practices to prevent cross-contamination, but individuals with severe gluten intolerance should exercise caution and consider reaching out to the company for more detailed information.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

    <p>Kraft Mayonnaise does not carry an official gluten-free certification from organizations like the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). However, the absence of gluten ingredients and the company's assurance make it a safe choice for most people on a gluten-free diet. If certification is a priority for you, you may want to explore other brands that offer certified gluten-free mayonnaise.</p>
