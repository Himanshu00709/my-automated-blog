<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Implications</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions. Therefore, it's crucial for these individuals to ensure that the products they consume are free from gluten.</p>

<p>When evaluating whether a product is gluten-free, it's essential to consider not only the ingredients but also the manufacturing processes. Cross-contamination can occur if the product is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

<h2>Tony Chachere's Injectables: Ingredients and Gluten Content</h2>
