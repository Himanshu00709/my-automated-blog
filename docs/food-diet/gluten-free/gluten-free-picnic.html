    <h1>Gluten-Free Picnic: A Guide to Delicious and Safe Outdoor Dining</h1>
    <p>Picnics are a wonderful way to enjoy the outdoors, spend time with loved ones, and indulge in delicious food. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, planning a picnic can be a bit more challenging. Ensuring that every dish is gluten-free requires careful preparation and attention to detail. But don’t worry—this guide will help you create a gluten-free picnic that’s both safe and satisfying for everyone.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Picnic?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergies. Even a small amount of gluten can cause severe reactions in these individuals, making it crucial to avoid cross-contamination and ensure that all foods are free from gluten-containing ingredients. A gluten-free picnic not only caters to those with dietary restrictions but also promotes a healthier lifestyle for everyone involved.</p>

    <h2>Planning Your Gluten-Free Picnic</h2>
    <p>Planning is key to a successful gluten-free picnic. Start by creating a menu that includes a variety of gluten-free options. Consider the preferences and dietary needs of your guests, and make sure to label all dishes clearly to avoid any confusion. Here’s a sample menu to get you started:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Category</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Options</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Appetizers</td>
                <td>Gluten-free crackers with hummus, vegetable platter with gluten-free dip</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Main Dishes</td>
                <td>Quinoa salad, gluten-free wraps with grilled chicken and veggies</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Side Dishes</td>
                <td>Fruit salad, gluten-free pasta salad, roasted vegetables</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Desserts</td>
                <td>Gluten-free brownies, fresh berries with whipped cream</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Beverages</td>
                <td>Sparkling water, iced tea, gluten-free beer or cider</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
