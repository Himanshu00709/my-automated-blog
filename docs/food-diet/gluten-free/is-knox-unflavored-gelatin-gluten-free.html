    <h1>Is Knox Unflavored Gelatin Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Gelatin is a versatile ingredient used in a variety of culinary applications, from desserts to savory dishes. For individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, ensuring that the products they consume are gluten-free is crucial.

In this article, we will explore this question in detail, providing you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>What is Knox Unflavored Gelatin?</h2>

    <p>Knox Unflavored Gelatin is a popular brand of gelatin that is widely used in cooking and baking. It is made from collagen, a protein derived from animal bones, skin, and connective tissues. The gelatin is processed to remove impurities, resulting in a pure, unflavored product that can be used in a variety of recipes.</p>

    <p>Knox Gelatin is known for its ability to create a gel-like consistency when mixed with liquids, making it a key ingredient in dishes like jellies, mousses, and marshmallows. It is also used as a thickening agent in soups, sauces, and gravies.</p>
