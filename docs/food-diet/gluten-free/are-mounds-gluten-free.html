<h1>Are Mounds Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of food can be a daunting task. One common question that arises is whether certain candies, like Mounds, are gluten-free. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of Mounds, explore their gluten-free status, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>What Are Mounds?</h2>

<p>Mounds are a popular candy bar produced by The Hershey Company. They consist of a sweetened coconut center coated in a rich, dark chocolate shell. Known for their distinctive flavor and texture, Mounds have been a favorite treat for many since their introduction in the 1920s. But are they safe for those who need to avoid gluten?</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to a range of symptoms and long-term health complications. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, avoiding gluten is essential to prevent discomfort and adverse health effects.</p>

<h2>Are Mounds Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>The good news is that Mounds are generally considered gluten-free. According to the ingredient list provided by The Hershey Company, Mounds do not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, it's important to note that while the ingredients themselves may be gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process.</p>
