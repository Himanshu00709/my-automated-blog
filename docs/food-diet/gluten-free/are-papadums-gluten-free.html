    <h1>Are Papadums Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Papadums, also known as papads, are a popular Indian snack made from lentil, chickpea, or rice flour. These thin, crispy wafers are often served as an appetizer or side dish in Indian cuisine. With the increasing prevalence of gluten intolerance and celiac disease, many people are wondering whether papadums are a safe option for those following a gluten-free diet. In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients used in papadums, their gluten content, and what to look for when purchasing gluten-free papadums.</p>
