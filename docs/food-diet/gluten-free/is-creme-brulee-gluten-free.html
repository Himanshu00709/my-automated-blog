    <h1>Is Crème Brûlée Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Crème brûlée, with its creamy custard base and caramelized sugar topping, is a dessert that has delighted palates for centuries. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Is crème brûlée gluten-free? In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore the ingredients, preparation methods, and potential pitfalls to help you enjoy this classic dessert without worry.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Presence in Desserts</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It’s commonly present in baked goods, pastas, and many processed foods. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and even long-term damage to the small intestine.</p>

    <p>When it comes to desserts, gluten can be hidden in various forms, such as flour used in cakes, cookies, and pastries. However, crème brûlée is traditionally made with simple ingredients that are naturally gluten-free. Let’s break down the components to understand why.</p>

    <h2>Traditional Crème Brûlée Ingredients</h2>

    <p>The classic crème brûlée recipe consists of the following ingredients:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Heavy Cream</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>

                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vanilla Extract</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free (check for additives)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>

    </ul>
