    <h1>Are El Milagro Tortillas Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>El Milagro tortillas are a staple in many households, known for their authentic taste and traditional preparation methods. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, determining whether these tortillas are safe to consume is crucial. In this article, we will explore whether El Milagro tortillas are gluten-free, delve into their ingredients, and provide insights for those following a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause severe health issues. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Gluten sensitivity, on the other hand, can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue without the intestinal damage seen in celiac disease.</p>

    <p>Given the potential health risks, it's essential for individuals with these conditions to avoid gluten-containing foods. This includes many types of bread, pasta, and, importantly, tortillas.</p>

    <h2>Are El Milagro Tortillas Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>El Milagro tortillas are primarily made from corn, which is naturally gluten-free. However, the manufacturing process and additional ingredients can sometimes introduce gluten into the product. To determine whether El Milagro tortillas are safe for a gluten-free diet, we need to examine their ingredients and production practices.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients in El Milagro Tortillas</h3>

    <p>The primary ingredient in El Milagro corn tortillas is masa harina, a type of corn flour that is traditionally gluten-free. However, some brands may add wheat flour or other gluten-containing ingredients to their tortillas. According to El Milagro's official website and product labeling, their corn tortillas are made with the following ingredients:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Corn masa flour</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Lime (calcium hydroxide)</li>
        <li>Cellulose gum</li>
        <li>Propionic acid</li>
        <li>Benzoic acid</li>
    </ul>

    <p>None of these ingredients contain gluten, which suggests that El Milagro corn tortillas are gluten-free. However, it's important to note that cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process, especially if the same equipment is used to produce both gluten-free and gluten-containing products.</p>

    <h3>Cross-Contamination Risks</h3>

    <p>Cross-contamination is a significant concern for individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity. Even trace amounts of gluten can trigger symptoms and cause intestinal damage. El Milagro does not explicitly state that their facilities are gluten-free or that they take specific measures to prevent cross-contamination. Therefore, while the ingredients in their corn tortillas are gluten-free, there is a potential risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

    <p>One way to ensure that a product is safe for a gluten-free diet is to look for gluten-free certification. Products that are certified gluten-free have been tested and verified to contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

    <p>El Milagro tortillas do not currently carry a gluten-free certification. This lack of certification does not necessarily mean that the product contains gluten, but it does mean that there is no third-party verification of its gluten-free status. For individuals with celiac disease, this may be a reason to exercise caution or choose a certified gluten-free alternative.</p>

    <h2>Comparing El Milagro Tortillas to Other Brands</h2>

    <p>When choosing gluten-free tortillas, it's helpful to compare El Milagro to other brands that offer gluten-free options. Below is a table comparing El Milagro corn tortillas to two other popular brands:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Brand</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Certification</th>
                <th>Ingredients</th>
                <th>Cross-Contamination Risk</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>El Milagro</td>
                <td>No</td>
                <td>Corn masa flour, water, lime, cellulose gum, propionic acid, benzoic acid</td>
                <td>Possible</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mission</td>
                <td>Yes (for some products)</td>
                <td>Corn masa flour, water, lime, cellulose gum, propionic acid, benzoic acid</td>
                <td>Low (for certified products)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>La Tortilla Factory</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
                <td>Corn masa flour, water, lime, cellulose gum, propionic acid, benzoic acid</td>
                <td>Low</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As seen in the table, El Milagro tortillas are comparable in ingredients to other brands but lack gluten-free certification. This makes them a less certain choice for those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity.</p>
