In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, preparation methods, and potential cross-contamination risks to determine if Panera Squash Soup is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What is Panera Squash Soup?</h2>

Cross-contamination can occur if the soup is prepared or served using utensils or equipment that have come into contact with gluten-containing foods.</p>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance, this risk of cross-contamination may be a concern. Panera does not guarantee that any of its menu items are completely free from gluten, so it’s always a good idea to exercise caution and communicate your dietary needs to the staff when ordering.</p>
