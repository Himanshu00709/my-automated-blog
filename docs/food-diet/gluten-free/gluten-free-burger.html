    <h1>Gluten-Free Burgers: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, and for good reason. Whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or a desire for a healthier lifestyle, more people are turning to gluten-free diets.

Fortunately, there are now many gluten-free alternatives available, making it easier than ever to enjoy a delicious burger without the worry of gluten.</p>

    <h3>1. Choose Your Patty</h3>
    <p>The patty is the heart of any burger. For a gluten-free burger, you can use a variety of options, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beef:</strong> Opt for 100% pure beef with no added fillers or seasonings that contain gluten.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>2. Select a Gluten-Free Bun</h3>
    <p>The bun is where most of the gluten in a traditional burger comes from. Fortunately, there are many gluten-free bun options available, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Store-Bought:</strong> Many grocery stores now carry gluten-free buns made from ingredients like rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca starch.</li>
        <li><strong>Homemade:</strong> If you’re feeling adventurous, you can make your own gluten-free buns using gluten-free flour blends.</li>
        <li><strong>Lettuce Wrap:</strong> For a low-carb option, skip the bun altogether and wrap your patty in large lettuce leaves.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Add Gluten-Free Toppings and Sauces</h3>
    <p>Toppings and sauces can make or break a burger. When making a gluten-free burger, be sure to choose toppings and sauces that are free from gluten. Some safe options include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Most cheeses are naturally gluten-free, but always check the label to be sure.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Fresh vegetables like lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pickles are all gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauces:</strong> Many condiments like mustard and mayonnaise are gluten-free, but be cautious with ketchup and barbecue sauce, as some brands may contain gluten.</li>
    </ul>
