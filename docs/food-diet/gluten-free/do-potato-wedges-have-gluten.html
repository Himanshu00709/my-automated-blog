    <h1>Do Potato Wedges Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Potato wedges are a popular side dish enjoyed by many, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, understanding whether they contain gluten is crucial. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause adverse reactions in individuals with gluten-related disorders. In this article, we will explore whether potato wedges contain gluten, how they are typically prepared, and what to look out for when ordering or making them at home.</p>

    <h2>What Are Potato Wedges?</h2>

    <p>Potato wedges are thick slices of potato that are typically seasoned and baked or fried until crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. They are often served as a side dish or snack and can be found in many restaurants and fast-food chains. The basic ingredients for potato wedges are simple: potatoes, oil, and seasonings. However, the preparation method and additional ingredients can vary, which may affect whether they contain gluten.</p>

    <h2>Are Potato Wedges Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Potatoes themselves are naturally gluten-free. They are a starchy vegetable that does not contain any gluten proteins. Therefore, in their purest form, potato wedges made from just potatoes, oil, and gluten-free seasonings should be safe for those avoiding gluten. However, the issue arises when additional ingredients or preparation methods introduce gluten into the dish.</p>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Potato Wedges</h2>

    <p>While the basic ingredients of potato wedges are gluten-free, there are several ways gluten can be introduced during preparation:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Source</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Seasonings</td>
                <td>Some pre-packaged seasonings or spice blends may contain gluten as a filler or anti-caking agent. Always check the label or use certified gluten-free seasonings.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Breading or Coatings</td>
                <td>Some recipes or restaurant preparations may coat the potato wedges in breadcrumbs or flour before frying, which would introduce gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cross-Contamination</td>
                <td>If potato wedges are prepared in a kitchen that also handles gluten-containing foods, there is a risk of cross-contamination. This is especially common in restaurants and fast-food chains.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Frying Oil</td>
                <td>If the same oil is used to fry gluten-containing foods (like breaded chicken or onion rings), the oil can become contaminated with gluten.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
