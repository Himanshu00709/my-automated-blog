<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Options at Sonic</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Are Sonic’s French Fries Gluten-Free?</h3>
    <p>Sonic’s French fries are made from potatoes and are naturally gluten-free. However, they are cooked in the same oil as other items that may contain gluten, so there is a risk of cross-contamination. If you have severe gluten sensitivity, it’s best to avoid them or ask the staff about their frying practices.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I Get a Gluten-Free Bun at Sonic?</h3>
    <p>As of now, Sonic does not offer gluten-free buns for their burgers or hot dogs. If you’re looking for a gluten-free option, consider ordering a burger or hot dog without the bun and enjoy it with a knife and fork.</p>

    <h3>3. Are Sonic’s Milkshakes Gluten-Free?</h3>
    <p>Most of Sonic’s milkshakes are gluten-free, but you should avoid any that include cookie or brownie mix-ins, as these may contain gluten. Always check with the staff to ensure your shake is safe.</p>

    <h3>4. Does Sonic Offer a Gluten-Free Menu?</h3>
    <p>Sonic does not have a dedicated gluten-free menu, but they do provide information about gluten-free options on their website. You can also ask the staff for assistance in identifying gluten-free items.</p>
