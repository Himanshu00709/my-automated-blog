<h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Greek Dressing</h2>

<p>While the core ingredients of Greek dressing are typically gluten-free, there are several potential sources of gluten to be aware of:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Thickeners and Stabilizers:</strong> Some store-bought dressings use thickeners like modified food starch, which can be derived from wheat. Always check the label for gluten-containing additives.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> Even if the ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can occur. Look for products labeled "certified gluten-free" to ensure safety.</li>
    <li><strong>Flavor Enhancers:</strong> Certain flavor enhancers or preservatives may contain gluten. For example, malt vinegar, which is derived from barley, is not gluten-free.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Ensure Your Greek Dressing is Gluten-Free</h2>

<p>If you’re following a gluten-free diet, here are some tips to ensure your Greek dressing is safe:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Read Labels Carefully:</strong> Always check the ingredient list and look for gluten-free certifications on store-bought dressings.</li>
    <li><strong>Make Your Own:</strong> Preparing Greek dressing at home allows you to control the ingredients and avoid gluten entirely. A simple recipe includes olive oil, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li><strong>Choose Trusted Brands:</strong> Opt for brands that specialize in gluten-free products or have a reputation for transparency in labeling.</li>
</ol>
