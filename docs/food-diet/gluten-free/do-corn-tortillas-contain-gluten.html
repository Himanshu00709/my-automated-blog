    <h1>Do Corn Tortillas Contain Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Corn tortillas are a staple in many cuisines, particularly in Mexican and Central American dishes. They are a versatile food item, used in everything from tacos to enchiladas. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding whether corn tortillas contain gluten is crucial. In this article, we will explore the composition of corn tortillas, their gluten content, and what you need to know to make informed dietary choices.</p>

    <h2>What Are Corn Tortillas Made Of?</h2>

    <p>Corn tortillas are traditionally made from masa harina, a type of corn flour that has been treated with an alkaline solution, such as lime water, in a process called nixtamalization. This process not only enhances the nutritional value of the corn but also gives the tortillas their characteristic flavor and texture. The basic ingredients for corn tortillas are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Masa harina (corn flour)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These simple ingredients make corn tortillas naturally gluten-free, as they do not contain wheat, barley, rye, or any other gluten-containing grains.</p>

    <h2>Are Corn Tortillas Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, corn tortillas are generally gluten-free. Since they are made from corn, which is a gluten-free grain, they are safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it's important to note that not all corn tortillas are created equal. Some commercially produced corn tortillas may contain additives or be processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products, which could lead to cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>To ensure that the corn tortillas you are consuming are truly gluten-free, always check the label for any gluten-containing ingredients or warnings about cross-contamination. Look for certifications such as "Certified Gluten-Free" to be extra cautious.</p>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Corn Tortillas</h2>

    <p>While corn tortillas are inherently gluten-free, there are a few scenarios where gluten might be introduced:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Source</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Additives</td>
                <td>Some manufacturers may add gluten-containing additives to improve texture or shelf life. Always check the ingredient list for any unfamiliar additives.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cross-Contamination</td>
                <td>If corn tortillas are produced in a facility that also processes wheat or other gluten-containing grains, there is a risk of cross-contamination. Look for products labeled "Certified Gluten-Free" to avoid this issue.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Flour Tortillas</td>
                <td>Be cautious when ordering tortillas at restaurants or buying pre-packaged tortillas. Flour tortillas, which are made from wheat, contain gluten and are not safe for those with gluten intolerance.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
