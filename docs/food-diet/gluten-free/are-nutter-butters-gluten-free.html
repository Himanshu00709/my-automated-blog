<h1>Are Nutter Butters Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Nutter Butters are a beloved snack for many, known for their peanut-shaped cookies and creamy peanut butter filling. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Nutter Butters are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and alternatives to help you make an informed decision about including Nutter Butters in your diet.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it is essential to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and manufacturing processes of any food product, including Nutter Butters.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Nutter Butters</h2>

<p>To determine whether Nutter Butters are gluten-free, we must first examine their ingredients. The primary ingredients in Nutter Butters include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Enriched flour (wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid)</li>
    <li>Peanut butter (peanuts, sugar, monoglycerides)</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil (palm kernel oil, palm oil)</li>
    <li>High fructose corn syrup</li>
    <li>Leavening (baking soda, calcium phosphate)</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Soy lecithin</li>
    <li>Natural and artificial flavors</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, the first ingredient listed is enriched flour, which is derived from wheat. This immediately raises a red flag for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination</h2>

<p>Even if a product does not contain gluten-containing ingredients, cross-contamination during manufacturing can still pose a risk. Nutter Butters are produced in facilities that also process other products containing gluten. This means that there is a possibility of cross-contamination, which could make Nutter Butters unsafe for individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Nutter Butters</h2>

<p>If you're craving the taste of peanut butter cookies but need to avoid gluten, there are several gluten-free alternatives available. Here are a few options:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Brand</th>
            <th>Product</th>
            <th>Gluten-Free Certification</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Glutino</td>
            <td>Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookies</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Enjoy Life</td>
            <td>Soft Baked Cookies - Double Chocolate Brownie</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Pamela's</td>
            <td>Peanut Butter Cookies</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>These products are specifically formulated to be gluten-free and are often produced in dedicated gluten-free facilities to minimize the risk of cross-contamination.</p>
