    <h1>Is Greek Salad Dressing Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Greek salad dressing is a staple in Mediterranean cuisine, known for its tangy, herbaceous flavor that perfectly complements fresh vegetables, olives, and feta cheese. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Greek salad dressing is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, potential sources of gluten, and how to ensure your Greek salad dressing is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Greek Salad Dressing Made Of?</h2>

    <p>Traditional Greek salad dressing is a simple yet flavorful combination of olive oil, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, and sometimes a touch of Dijon mustard. These ingredients are naturally gluten-free, making the dressing a safe option for most people. However, the devil is in the details, and it’s essential to scrutinize each component, especially when purchasing pre-made dressings.</p>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Greek Salad Dressing</h2>

    <p>While the core ingredients of Greek salad dressing are gluten-free, there are a few potential pitfalls to watch out for:</p>

    <h3>1. Pre-Made Dressings</h3>
    <p>Store-bought Greek salad dressings may contain additives, thickeners, or flavor enhancers that could introduce gluten. Ingredients like malt vinegar, modified food starch, or hydrolyzed wheat protein are red flags. Always read the label carefully and look for a certified gluten-free seal.</p>

    <h3>2. Cross-Contamination</h3>
    <p>Even if the ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can occur. This is especially true in facilities that process gluten-containing products. Opt for brands that explicitly state their products are made in a gluten-free facility.</p>

    <h3>3. Restaurant Dressings</h3>
    <p>When dining out, it’s harder to control the ingredients and preparation methods. Some restaurants may use pre-made dressings with hidden gluten or prepare the dressing in shared equipment. Always ask your server about the ingredients and preparation process.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Greek Salad Dressing at Home</h2>

    <p>Making your own Greek salad dressing at home is the safest way to ensure it’s gluten-free. Here’s a simple recipe:</p>
