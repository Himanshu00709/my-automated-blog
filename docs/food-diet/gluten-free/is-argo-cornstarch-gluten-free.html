<h1>Is Argo Cornstarch Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. For those who must avoid gluten, even the smallest trace can cause significant health issues. One common kitchen staple that often comes under scrutiny is cornstarch. Specifically, many people wonder: <strong>Is Argo Cornstarch gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the topic, exploring what cornstarch is, how it’s made, and whether Argo Cornstarch is safe for those on a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What is Cornstarch?</h2>

<p>Cornstarch is a fine, powdery substance derived from the endosperm of corn kernels. It is commonly used as a thickening agent in cooking and baking, helping to create smooth sauces, gravies, and puddings. Cornstarch is also used in various industrial applications, such as in the production of adhesives and paper products.</p>

<p>Because cornstarch is derived from corn, which is naturally gluten-free, it is generally considered safe for those who need to avoid gluten. However, cross-contamination during processing can sometimes introduce gluten into the product. This is why it’s essential to look for products that are certified gluten-free.</p>

<h2>Is Argo Cornstarch Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Argo Cornstarch is one of the most popular brands of cornstarch available in the market. According to the manufacturer, Argo Cornstarch is made from 100% pure corn and does not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, it’s important to note that Argo Cornstarch is not certified gluten-free by a third-party organization.</p>

<p>While the product itself is gluten-free, there is always a risk of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process. This is particularly relevant for individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, who may react to even trace amounts of gluten. If you fall into this category, it’s advisable to look for a cornstarch product that is certified gluten-free.</p>

<h2>How is Argo Cornstarch Made?</h2>

<p>Understanding how Argo Cornstarch is made can provide further insight into its gluten-free status. The process begins with the extraction of starch from corn kernels. The corn is first cleaned and then steeped in water to soften the kernels. The softened kernels are then ground, and the starch is separated from the other components of the corn, such as protein and fiber.</p>

<p>The starch is then washed, dried, and milled into a fine powder, which is what we know as cornstarch. Throughout this process, there is no addition of gluten-containing ingredients. However, as mentioned earlier, the risk of cross-contamination exists if the facility also processes gluten-containing products.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Certification: What Does It Mean?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free certification is a process by which a third-party organization verifies that a product meets strict gluten-free standards. These standards typically require that the product contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

<p>While Argo Cornstarch is not certified gluten-free, it is made from 100% pure corn and does not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. For most people, this is sufficient to consider it gluten-free. However, for those with severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, a certified gluten-free product may be a safer choice.</p>
