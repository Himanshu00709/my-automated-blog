    <h1>Simply Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the gluten-free diet has gained significant attention, not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle. Whether you're new to the gluten-free world or looking to refine your knowledge, this guide will provide you with everything you need to know about living simply gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It acts as a binding agent, giving bread and other baked goods their elasticity and chewy texture. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergy, it can cause serious health issues.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>There are several reasons why someone might choose to adopt a gluten-free diet:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Celiac Disease:</strong> An autoimmune disorder where gluten ingestion damages the small intestine.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity:</strong> Symptoms similar to celiac disease but without the intestinal damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Wheat Allergy:</strong> An allergic reaction to proteins found in wheat.</li>
        <li><strong>Health and Wellness:</strong> Some people believe a gluten-free diet can lead to better digestion, increased energy, and weight loss.</li>
    </ul>

        <p>Not necessarily. A gluten-free diet is essential for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but for others, it may not provide additional health benefits and could lead to nutritional deficiencies if not managed properly.</p>
