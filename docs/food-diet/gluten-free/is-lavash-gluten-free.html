    <h1>Is Lavash Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Lavash, a traditional flatbread originating from Armenia, has gained popularity worldwide due to its versatility and delicious taste. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether lavash is gluten-free is of utmost importance. In this article, we will delve into the composition of lavash, its gluten content, and explore gluten-free alternatives for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Lavash?</h2>
    <p>Lavash is a soft, thin flatbread that is a staple in many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. It is traditionally made from flour, water, and salt, and is baked in a tandoor or on a hot surface. Lavash can be used in a variety of ways, from wrapping kebabs and sandwiches to serving as a base for pizzas or even as a cracker when dried.</p>

    <h2>Is Lavash Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>The primary ingredient in traditional lavash is wheat flour, which contains gluten. Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye that gives dough its elasticity and helps it rise. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine.</p>
    <p>Therefore, traditional lavash is not gluten-free. However, there are gluten-free versions of lavash available on the market, made from alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour. These gluten-free lavash options provide a safe alternative for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Lavash Alternatives</h2>
    <p>For those who need to avoid gluten, there are several gluten-free lavash alternatives available. These alternatives are made from gluten-free flours and are often fortified with additional nutrients to mimic the texture and taste of traditional lavash. Below is a table comparing traditional lavash with gluten-free alternatives:</p>
