<h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Birria Tacos</h2>

<p>While many of the core ingredients in birria tacos are naturally gluten-free, there are a few potential sources of gluten that you should be aware of:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Corn Tortillas:</strong> While corn tortillas are typically gluten-free, some brands may use wheat flour as a filler. Always check the label to ensure that the tortillas are 100% corn-based.</li>
    <li><strong>Consommé:</strong> The broth used in birria tacos is usually gluten-free, but some recipes or pre-packaged broths may contain gluten-containing additives or thickeners. It’s essential to verify the ingredients or make the broth from scratch.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If birria tacos are prepared in a kitchen that also handles gluten-containing foods, there is a risk of cross-contamination. This is especially important for those with celiac disease, as even trace amounts of gluten can cause a reaction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Ensure Your Birria Tacos Are Gluten-Free</h2>

<p>If you’re preparing birria tacos at home, there are several steps you can take to ensure that they are gluten-free:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Use 100% Corn Tortillas:</strong> Always check the label to ensure that the tortillas are made solely from corn and do not contain any wheat flour.</li>
    <li><strong>Make Your Own Consommé:</strong> By making the broth from scratch, you can control the ingredients and avoid any gluten-containing additives.</li>
    <li><strong>Check Spices and Seasonings:</strong> Some pre-packaged spice blends may contain gluten as an anti-caking agent. Opt for single-ingredient spices or check the labels carefully.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid Cross-Contamination:</strong> Use separate utensils, cutting boards, and cookware when preparing gluten-free dishes to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
</ol>
