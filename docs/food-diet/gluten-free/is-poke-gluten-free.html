<h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Poke</h2>

<p>While many of the ingredients in poke are naturally gluten-free, there are a few potential sources of gluten that you should be aware of:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Soy Sauce:</strong> Traditional soy sauce is made with wheat, making it a common source of gluten in poke. However, gluten-free soy sauce alternatives are available and should be used if you’re avoiding gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Imitation Crab:</strong> Imitation crab, often used in poke bowls, is typically made with wheat flour. If you’re gluten-sensitive, it’s best to avoid imitation crab and opt for real crab or other gluten-free proteins.</li>
    <li><strong>Marinades and Sauces:</strong> Some poke marinades and sauces may contain gluten as a thickening agent or flavor enhancer. Always check the ingredients or ask the chef if you’re unsure.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> Even if all the ingredients in your poke bowl are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur if the same utensils or surfaces are used for gluten-containing foods. Be sure to communicate your dietary needs to the staff when ordering.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Enjoy Gluten-Free Poke</h2>

<p>If you’re looking to enjoy a gluten-free poke bowl, here are some tips to ensure your meal is safe and delicious:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Choose Gluten-Free Soy Sauce:</strong> Opt for gluten-free soy sauce or tamari when marinating your fish or as a condiment.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid Imitation Crab:</strong> Stick to real crab or other gluten-free proteins like tofu or cooked shrimp.</li>
    <li><strong>Check the Marinade:</strong> If you’re dining out, ask about the ingredients in the marinade or sauce. Many restaurants are happy to accommodate gluten-free requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Be Mindful of Cross-Contamination:</strong> If you’re highly sensitive to gluten, inform the staff about your dietary restrictions to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Make It at Home:</strong> Preparing poke at home allows you to control all the ingredients and ensure your meal is 100% gluten-free.</li>
</ol>
