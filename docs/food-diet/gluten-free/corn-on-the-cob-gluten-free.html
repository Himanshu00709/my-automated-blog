    <h1>Corn on the Cob: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

    <p>Corn on the cob is a beloved summer staple, enjoyed at barbecues, picnics, and family gatherings. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question often arises: Is corn on the cob gluten-free? The good news is that corn, in its natural form, is naturally gluten-free. However, there are some considerations to keep in mind to ensure that your corn on the cob remains safe for a gluten-free diet. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about enjoying corn on the cob while maintaining a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Corn on the Cob Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Corn, also known as maize, is a cereal grain that is naturally free from gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. Since corn does not belong to this group of grains, it is inherently gluten-free. This makes corn on the cob a safe and delicious option for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <p>However, it’s important to note that while corn itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during processing, packaging, or preparation. For example, if corn is processed in a facility that also handles wheat, there is a risk of gluten contamination. Therefore, it’s crucial to read labels carefully and choose products that are certified gluten-free if you have celiac disease or a severe gluten sensitivity.</p>
