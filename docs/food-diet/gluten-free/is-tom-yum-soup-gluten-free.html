<p>As you can see, the core ingredients of Tom Yum Soup are naturally gluten-free. However, the devil is in the details, and certain additives or preparation methods can introduce gluten into the dish.</p>

<h2>Potential Gluten-Containing Ingredients</h2>

<p>While the traditional recipe is gluten-free, some variations or restaurant preparations may include ingredients that contain gluten. Here are a few to watch out for:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Soy Sauce:</strong> Some recipes use soy sauce for added umami flavor. Most soy sauces contain wheat, making them unsuitable for a gluten-free diet. Opt for tamari or gluten-free soy sauce instead.</li>
    <li><strong>Oyster Sauce:</strong> Often used in Thai cooking, oyster sauce may contain wheat as a thickening agent. Always check the label or ask the chef.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-Made Pastes:</strong> Some chefs use pre-made Tom Yum paste, which may contain gluten as a stabilizer or filler. Always verify the ingredients or make your own paste at home.</li>
    <li><strong>Thickeners:</strong> Cornstarch or tapioca starch are gluten-free thickeners, but some recipes might use wheat flour. Ensure the thickener used is gluten-free.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Stick to fresh herbs, spices, and proteins. Avoid pre-packaged or processed items unless they are certified gluten-free.</li>
    <li><strong>Check Labels:</strong> When using sauces like fish sauce or soy sauce, read the labels carefully. Look for gluten-free certifications or opt for tamari.</li>
    <li><strong>Make Your Own Paste:</strong> Instead of using store-bought Tom Yum paste, make your own using fresh ingredients. This way, you can avoid hidden gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> When dining out, don’t hesitate to ask the chef or server about the ingredients and preparation methods. Many restaurants are accommodating to dietary restrictions.</li>
</ol>
