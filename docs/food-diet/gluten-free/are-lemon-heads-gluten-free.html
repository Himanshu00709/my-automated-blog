    <h1>Are Lemon Heads Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, determining whether a food product is gluten-free is crucial. Lemon Heads, the popular tangy and sweet candy, often come under scrutiny for their ingredients. In this article, we will explore whether Lemon Heads are gluten-free, delve into their ingredients, and provide a comprehensive guide for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What Are Lemon Heads?</h2>

    <p>Lemon Heads are a classic American candy known for their sour lemon flavor and sweet finish. They are small, round, and yellow, with a hard candy shell and a slightly chewy center. Manufactured by Ferrara Candy Company, Lemon Heads have been a favorite treat for decades. But are they safe for those who need to avoid gluten?</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even small amounts of gluten can cause symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. Therefore, it's essential for those with gluten-related disorders to carefully scrutinize food labels and ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Lemon Heads</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Lemon Heads are gluten-free, let's take a closer look at their ingredients. The primary ingredients in Lemon Heads include:</p>
