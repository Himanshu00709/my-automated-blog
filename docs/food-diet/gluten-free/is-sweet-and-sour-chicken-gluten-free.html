    <h1>Is Sweet and Sour Chicken Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Sweet and sour chicken is a popular dish enjoyed by many, known for its perfect balance of tangy and sweet flavors. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, determining whether this dish is safe to consume can be a challenge. In this article, we will explore whether sweet and sour chicken is gluten-free, what ingredients to watch out for, and how to make a gluten-free version at home.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is commonly present in foods like bread, pasta, and baked goods, but it can also be hidden in sauces, marinades, and processed foods. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine.</p>

    <h2>Is Traditional Sweet and Sour Chicken Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Traditional sweet and sour chicken is typically not gluten-free. The dish often contains ingredients that are sources of gluten, such as soy sauce, which is made from wheat. Additionally, the chicken is usually coated in a batter or flour before being fried, both of which contain gluten. The sauce itself may also contain thickeners or flavorings that include gluten.</p>
