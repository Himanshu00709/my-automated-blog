    <h1>Is Welch's Grape Jelly Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of food products can be a daunting task. One common question that arises is whether popular products like Welch's Grape Jelly are gluten-free. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to determine if Welch's Grape Jelly is safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to ensure that the foods they consume are free from gluten.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Welch's Grape Jelly</h2>

    <p>To determine if Welch's Grape Jelly is gluten-free, we first need to examine its ingredients. The primary ingredients in Welch's Grape Jelly include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Concord Grapes</li>

        <li>Fruit Pectin</li>
        <li>Citric Acid</li>

    </ul>

    <p>None of these ingredients inherently contain gluten. However, it's essential to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process.</p>
