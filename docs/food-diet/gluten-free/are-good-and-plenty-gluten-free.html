    <h1>Are Good & Plenty Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Good & Plenty, the iconic licorice candy coated in a hard shell, has been a favorite treat for generations. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, many people are questioning whether this classic candy is safe to consume. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients of Good & Plenty, explore whether they are gluten-free, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>What is Good & Plenty?</h2>

    <p>Good & Plenty is a licorice candy that has been around since 1893, making it one of the oldest candies in the United States.
