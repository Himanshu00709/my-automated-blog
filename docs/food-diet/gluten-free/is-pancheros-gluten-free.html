<h2>Cross-Contamination Risks at Pancheros</h2>

<p>While Pancheros offers several gluten-free options, cross-contamination is a potential concern. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods or surfaces. At Pancheros, this could happen in several ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Shared Cooking Surfaces:</strong> If the same grill or prep area is used for both gluten-containing and gluten-free items, there’s a risk of cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Shared Utensils:</strong> Using the same utensils for gluten-containing and gluten-free items can also lead to cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Toppings and Condiments:</strong> If toppings like cheese or salsa are shared between gluten-containing and gluten-free items, cross-contamination can occur.</li>
</ul>

<p>To minimize the risk of cross-contamination, it’s important to communicate your dietary needs to the staff. Pancheros employees are trained to handle special dietary requests, so don’t hesitate to ask for assistance.</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Choose Corn Tortillas:</strong> Opt for corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas, as corn tortillas are naturally gluten-free.</li>
    <li><strong>Go for Bowls:</strong> Bowls are a safe bet since they don’t require a tortilla and can be customized with gluten-free ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong>Ask About Preparation:</strong> Always inform the staff about your gluten-free needs and ask how they prepare gluten-free items to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Check Ingredients:</strong> While many items are gluten-free, it’s always a good idea to double-check the ingredients list, especially for sauces and dressings.</li>
    <li><strong>Be Cautious with Toppings:</strong> Some toppings, like certain salsas or sauces, may contain gluten. Always ask before adding them to your meal.</li>
