    <h1>Is Knorr Tomato Bouillon Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Knorr Tomato Bouillon is a popular seasoning product used in kitchens worldwide to enhance the flavor of soups, stews, rice dishes, and more. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, determining whether a product is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will explore whether Knorr Tomato Bouillon is gluten-free, its ingredients, and what you need to know to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and long-term complications. Therefore, identifying gluten-free products is essential for maintaining a healthy diet.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Knorr Tomato Bouillon</h2>

    <p>To determine if Knorr Tomato Bouillon is gluten-free, we need to examine its ingredients. The primary ingredients typically include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)</li>
        <li>Hydrolyzed Soy Protein</li>
        <li>Tomato Powder</li>
        <li>Onion Powder</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Artificial Flavors</li>
        <li>Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 (food colorings)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While many of these ingredients are naturally gluten-free, some may raise concerns. For example, hydrolyzed soy protein can sometimes be derived from wheat, which contains gluten. Additionally, artificial flavors and food colorings may contain hidden gluten sources.</p>

    <h2>Is Knorr Tomato Bouillon Certified Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>As of the latest information available, Knorr Tomato Bouillon is not certified gluten-free. This means that while the product may not contain gluten-containing ingredients, there is a risk of cross-contamination during manufacturing. Knorr does not explicitly label this product as gluten-free, so individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity should exercise caution.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free products come into contact with gluten-containing products during manufacturing, packaging, or transportation. Even trace amounts of gluten can trigger symptoms in sensitive individuals. Since Knorr Tomato Bouillon is not certified gluten-free, there is a possibility of cross-contamination in facilities that also process gluten-containing products.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Knorr Tomato Bouillon</h2>
