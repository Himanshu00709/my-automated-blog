    <h1>Gluten-Free Thailand: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Thailand, known for its vibrant street food culture and rich culinary traditions, might seem like a challenging destination for those following a gluten-free diet. However, with a little knowledge and preparation, navigating Thailand’s food scene can be both enjoyable and safe for gluten-free travelers. This guide will provide you with everything you need to know about eating gluten-free in Thailand, from understanding local ingredients to finding gluten-free-friendly restaurants.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten in Thai Cuisine</h2>
    <p>Thai cuisine is renowned for its bold flavors, which are often achieved through the use of fresh herbs, spices, and sauces. However, some of these sauces and ingredients can contain gluten. For example, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and fish sauce are commonly used in Thai cooking, and while fish sauce is typically gluten-free, soy and oyster sauces often contain wheat.</p>
    <p>It’s important to note that many traditional Thai dishes are naturally gluten-free, especially those that rely on rice, rice noodles, and fresh vegetables. Dishes like Pad Thai, Som Tum (green papaya salad), and Tom Yum Goong (spicy shrimp soup) can often be made gluten-free with minor adjustments.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Ingredients in Thai Cooking</h2>
    <p>Here’s a list of common Thai ingredients and their gluten-free status:</p>
