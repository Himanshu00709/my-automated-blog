    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Chicken Satay</h2>

    <p>While many of the ingredients in chicken satay are naturally gluten-free, there are a few potential sources of gluten that you should be aware of:</p>

    <h3>1. Soy Sauce</h3>

    <p>Soy sauce is a common ingredient in chicken satay marinades and peanut sauce. Traditional soy sauce is made from fermented soybeans and wheat, which means it contains gluten. However, gluten-free soy sauce alternatives are available and can be used to make chicken satay safe for those with gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h3>2. Marinades and Sauces</h3>

    <p>Some pre-made marinades and sauces may contain hidden sources of gluten, such as thickeners or flavor enhancers. It's essential to read labels carefully or make your marinades and sauces from scratch using gluten-free ingredients.</p>

    <h3>3. Cross-Contamination</h3>

    <p>Cross-contamination can occur if chicken satay is prepared or cooked in a kitchen where gluten-containing foods are also prepared. This can happen on shared grills, cutting boards, or utensils. To avoid cross-contamination, ensure that all cooking surfaces and tools are thoroughly cleaned before use.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Chicken Satay</h2>

    <p>If you're preparing chicken satay at home and want to ensure it's gluten-free, follow these steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use Gluten-Free Soy Sauce:</strong> Replace traditional soy sauce with a gluten-free alternative. Many brands offer gluten-free soy sauce that is made without wheat.</li>
        <li><strong>Check All Ingredients:</strong> Carefully read the labels of all ingredients, including spices, sauces, and marinades, to ensure they are gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Cross-Contamination:</strong> Use separate cooking utensils, cutting boards, and grills to prevent cross-contamination with gluten-containing foods.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Your Own Peanut Sauce:</strong> Prepare your peanut sauce from scratch using gluten-free ingredients to avoid hidden sources of gluten.</li>
    </ol>
