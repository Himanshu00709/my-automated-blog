    <h1>Is Ube Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Ube, also known as purple yam, has gained immense popularity in recent years, especially in the culinary world. Its vibrant purple color and unique flavor have made it a favorite ingredient in desserts, beverages, and even savory dishes. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Is ube gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we will explore the gluten-free nature of ube, its nutritional benefits, and how to incorporate it into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Ube?</h2>

    <p>Ube (<em>Dioscorea alata</em>) is a species of yam native to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines.

It is commonly used in desserts like ube halaya (a sweet jam), ube ice cream, and ube cakes.</p>

    <h2>Is Ube Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>
