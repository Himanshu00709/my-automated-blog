    <h1>Are Mission Yellow Corn Tortillas Gluten-Free?</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. For those who must avoid gluten, finding safe and delicious alternatives to traditional wheat-based products is essential. One such product that often comes under scrutiny is tortillas, particularly yellow corn tortillas. In this article, we will delve into whether Mission Yellow Corn Tortillas are gluten-free, explore their ingredients, and provide insights for those following a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize the ingredients of the foods they consume.</p>

    <p>Corn, on the other hand, is naturally gluten-free, making corn tortillas a popular choice for those avoiding gluten. However, cross-contamination during processing or the addition of gluten-containing ingredients can render a product unsafe for those with gluten-related disorders.</p>

    <h2>Mission Yellow Corn Tortillas: Ingredients and Gluten-Free Status</h2>

    <p>Mission Foods is a well-known brand that produces a variety of tortillas, including yellow corn tortillas. According to the company, their yellow corn tortillas are made from a simple list of ingredients:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Ground yellow corn</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Cellulose gum</li>
        <li>Propionic acid</li>
        <li>Benzoic acid</li>
        <li>Phosphoric acid</li>
        <li>Guar gum</li>
        <li>Enzymes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Notably, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it is essential to consider the potential for cross-contamination during the manufacturing process. Mission Foods states that they follow strict protocols to prevent cross-contamination, and their yellow corn tortillas are certified gluten-free by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). This certification ensures that the product contains less than 10 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most individuals with celiac disease.</p>
