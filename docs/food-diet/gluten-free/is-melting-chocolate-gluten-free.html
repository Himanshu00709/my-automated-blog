    <h1>Is Melting Chocolate Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Chocolate is a beloved treat enjoyed by millions around the world. Whether it's used in baking, as a topping, or simply enjoyed on its own, chocolate has a special place in our hearts. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether melting chocolate is gluten-free is an important one. In this article, we'll explore the gluten-free status of melting chocolate, what to look for when purchasing it, and how to ensure your chocolate remains safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Presence in Chocolate</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is commonly found in bread, pasta, and baked goods, but it can also sneak into less obvious products, including chocolate. While pure chocolate made from cocoa beans, cocoa butter, and sugar is naturally gluten-free, the addition of other ingredients or cross-contamination during manufacturing can introduce gluten into the final product.</p>

    <p>When it comes to melting chocolate, the gluten-free status depends on the type of chocolate and the manufacturing process. Let's break it down further.</p>

    <h2>Types of Melting Chocolate and Their Gluten-Free Status</h2>
