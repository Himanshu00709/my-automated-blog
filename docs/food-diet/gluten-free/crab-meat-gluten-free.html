    <h1>Crab Meat: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding delicious and safe food options can sometimes be a challenge. However, seafood lovers can rejoice because crab meat is naturally gluten-free and packed with nutrients.

Always check labels and ask about preparation methods when dining out.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Crab Meat</h2>
    <p>Crab meat is not only gluten-free but also a nutritional powerhouse. It is low in fat and calories while being rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals. Here are some of the key nutrients found in crab meat:</p>
