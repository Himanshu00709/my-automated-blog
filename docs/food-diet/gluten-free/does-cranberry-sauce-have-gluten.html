    <h1>Does Cranberry Sauce Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Cranberry sauce is a staple on many holiday tables, especially during Thanksgiving and Christmas. Its sweet and tangy flavor complements roasted meats, stuffing, and other festive dishes. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether cranberry sauce contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients typically found in cranberry sauce, discuss gluten-free options, and provide tips for ensuring your cranberry sauce is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and long-term complications like osteoporosis or neurological disorders. Therefore, understanding whether a food product contains gluten is essential for maintaining a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Traditional Cranberry Sauce</h2>

    <p>Traditional cranberry sauce is made from a few simple ingredients: cranberries, sugar, and water. These ingredients are naturally gluten-free. However, some store-bought or homemade recipes may include additional ingredients that could introduce gluten. Below is a breakdown of common ingredients and their gluten status:</p>
