<h1>Does Duck Sauce Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Duck sauce, a popular condiment often served with Chinese cuisine, is known for its sweet and tangy flavor. It’s a staple in many households and restaurants, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Does duck sauce have gluten?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients of duck sauce, explore whether it contains gluten, and provide tips for those who need to avoid gluten in their diet.</p>

<p>Duck sauce is a condiment typically made from a combination of apricots, plums, sugar, vinegar, and spices. It has a sweet and slightly tangy flavor, making it a perfect accompaniment to dishes like egg rolls, spring rolls, and roasted duck. Despite its name, duck sauce doesn’t actually contain duck; the name likely comes from its traditional pairing with duck dishes in Chinese cuisine.</p>
