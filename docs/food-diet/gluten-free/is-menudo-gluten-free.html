    <h1>Is Menudo Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Menudo, a traditional Mexican soup made with tripe (beef stomach) and a rich, spicy broth, is a beloved dish in many households. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether menudo is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients typically used in menudo, potential sources of gluten, and how to ensure your menudo is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Menudo?</h2>

    <p>Menudo is a traditional Mexican dish that has been enjoyed for generations.
