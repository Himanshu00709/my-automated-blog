    <h1>Are Mission Tortilla Chips Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>When it comes to snacking, tortilla chips are a popular choice for many. They are versatile, delicious, and can be paired with a variety of dips and toppings. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether tortilla chips are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will delve into the specifics of Mission Tortilla Chips, one of the most well-known brands, to determine if they are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Mission Tortilla Chips?</h2>

    <p>Mission Foods is a leading brand in the tortilla and tortilla chip market, offering a wide range of products that cater to different dietary needs and preferences. Their tortilla chips are made from corn, which is naturally gluten-free. However, the manufacturing process and additional ingredients can sometimes introduce gluten into the final product.</p>

    <h2>Are Mission Tortilla Chips Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, Mission Tortilla Chips are generally considered gluten-free. The primary ingredient in these chips is corn, which does not contain gluten. However, it's important to note that while the ingredients themselves may be gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. Mission Foods takes precautions to minimize this risk, but it's always a good idea to check the packaging for any gluten-free certifications or warnings.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients in Mission Tortilla Chips</h3>

    <p>The basic ingredients in Mission Tortilla Chips include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Corn</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil (Sunflower, Canola, or Corn Oil)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These ingredients are naturally gluten-free, but it's essential to be aware of any additional flavorings or seasonings that may contain gluten. Always read the label to ensure that the specific variety you are purchasing is gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

Look for the gluten-free label on the packaging to be sure.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>
