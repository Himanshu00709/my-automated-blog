<h1>Gluten-Free Universal: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the gluten-free diet has gained immense popularity, not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle. Gluten-free diets are no longer a niche trend; they have become a universal movement. This article delves into the world of gluten-free living, exploring its benefits, challenges, and how to navigate this lifestyle with ease.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It acts as a binding agent, giving dough its elasticity and helping it rise. For most people, gluten is harmless.

<h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>There are several reasons why individuals choose to adopt a gluten-free diet:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Celiac Disease:</strong> An autoimmune disorder where gluten ingestion damages the small intestine.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity:</strong> Individuals experience symptoms similar to celiac disease but without the intestinal damage.</li>
    <li><strong>Wheat Allergy:</strong> An allergic reaction to proteins found in wheat.</li>
    <li><strong>Health and Wellness:</strong> Some people believe that a gluten-free diet can lead to weight loss, improved digestion, and overall better health.</li>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Is a gluten-free diet healthier for everyone?</h3>
