    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Clam Chowder</h2>

    <p>While many of the primary ingredients in clam chowder are naturally gluten-free, there are a few potential sources of gluten that you need to be aware of:</p>

    <h3>1. Flour as a Thickener</h3>

    <p>One of the most common ways to thicken clam chowder is by using flour. Flour is typically made from wheat, which contains gluten. If you’re dining out or purchasing pre-made clam chowder, it’s essential to ask whether flour has been used as a thickening agent. Some recipes may use cornstarch or gluten-free flour as an alternative, but this is not always the case.</p>

    <h3>2. Cross-Contamination</h3>

    <p>Even if the ingredients in clam chowder are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during preparation. This is especially true in restaurants where the same utensils, pots, or surfaces may be used for both gluten-containing and gluten-free foods. If you’re highly sensitive to gluten, it’s crucial to inquire about the kitchen’s practices to avoid cross-contamination.</p>

    <h3>3. Pre-Made or Canned Clam Chowder</h3>

    <p>Pre-made or canned clam chowder often contains additives or preservatives that may include gluten. Always read the label carefully, and look for products that are certified gluten-free. Some brands specifically cater to gluten-free diets, so these can be a safer option.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Clam Chowder at Home</h2>

    <p>If you’re concerned about gluten in clam chowder, making it at home is the safest option. Here’s a simple recipe for gluten-free clam chowder:</p>

        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
