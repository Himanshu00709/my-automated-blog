    <h1>Are Peeps Gummies Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Peeps, the iconic marshmallow candies, have been a staple in American households for decades. Known for their vibrant colors and unique shapes, Peeps are a favorite during holidays like Easter and Halloween. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Are Peeps gummies gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to provide a clear answer.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize the ingredients of any food product, including candies like Peeps.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Peeps Gummies</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Peeps gummies are gluten-free, we first need to examine their ingredients. The primary ingredients in Peeps include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Corn syrup</li>
        <li>Gelatin</li>
        <li>Yellow #5 (Tartrazine)</li>
        <li>Red #40</li>
        <li>Blue #1</li>
        <li>Natural and artificial flavors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>None of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it’s important to note that while the ingredients themselves may be gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing could still pose a risk.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination</h2>

    <p>Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free products come into contact with gluten-containing products or surfaces during manufacturing. This can happen in facilities that process both gluten-free and gluten-containing foods. To assess the risk of cross-contamination with Peeps, we need to look at the manufacturing practices of Just Born, the company that produces Peeps.</p>

    <p>Just Born has stated that they take precautions to prevent cross-contamination. However, they also note that their facilities do process products that contain gluten. Therefore, while Peeps are made with gluten-free ingredients, there is a possibility of cross-contamination during production.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

    <p>One way to ensure that a product is truly gluten-free is to look for gluten-free certification from a reputable organization. Unfortunately, Peeps do not currently carry a gluten-free certification. This means that while the ingredients are gluten-free, the lack of certification leaves some uncertainty regarding cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Are Peeps Gummies Safe for Celiacs?</h2>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease, even trace amounts of gluten can trigger symptoms. Given that Peeps are made in facilities that also process gluten-containing products, there is a risk of cross-contamination. Therefore, while Peeps may be safe for some individuals with gluten sensitivity, they may not be suitable for those with celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Alternatives to Peeps for Gluten-Free Consumers</h2>

    <p>If you’re looking for gluten-free alternatives to Peeps, there are several options available. Many brands offer gluten-free marshmallow candies that are certified gluten-free, ensuring they are safe for individuals with celiac disease. Some popular alternatives include:</p>
