    <h1>Is Pico de Gallo Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Pico de gallo, a fresh and vibrant salsa made from diced tomatoes, onions, cilantro, jalape単os, and lime juice, is a staple in Mexican cuisine. It's a versatile condiment that pairs well with tacos, grilled meats, and even as a dip for tortilla chips. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Is pico de gallo gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we'll explore the ingredients, potential cross-contamination risks, and how to ensure your pico de gallo is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It's what gives dough its elasticity and helps it rise. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions. Therefore, it's crucial to identify whether a food item contains gluten or is at risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Pico de Gallo</h2>

    <p>Pico de gallo is traditionally made with the following ingredients:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Cilantro</li>
        <li>Jalape単os</li>
        <li>Lime juice</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, these ingredients are naturally gluten-free. However, it's essential to consider the preparation process and any additional ingredients that might be added, such as pre-packaged seasonings or sauces, which could contain gluten.</p>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Pico de Gallo</h2>

    <p>While the basic ingredients of pico de gallo are gluten-free, there are a few scenarios where gluten could be introduced:</p>

            <tr>
                <td>Store-Bought Pico de Gallo</td>
