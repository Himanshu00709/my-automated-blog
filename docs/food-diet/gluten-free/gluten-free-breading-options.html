    <h1>Gluten-Free Breading Options: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or those simply choosing to avoid gluten, finding suitable breading options can be a challenge. Traditional breading often relies on wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, the growing awareness of gluten-related health issues has led to the development of numerous gluten-free alternatives.

Even for those without these conditions, reducing gluten intake can sometimes lead to improved digestion and overall well-being. Gluten-free breading options not only cater to dietary restrictions but also offer a variety of flavors and textures that can enhance your culinary creations.</p>

    <h2>How to Use Gluten-Free Breading</h2>
    <p>Using gluten-free breading is similar to using traditional breading, but there are a few tips to ensure the best results:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Combine Flours:</strong> Mixing different gluten-free flours can create a more balanced texture and flavor. For example, combining almond flour with rice flour can give you a crispy yet tender coating.</li>
