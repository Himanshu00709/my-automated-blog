<h1>Are Au Gratin Potatoes Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Au gratin potatoes are a beloved comfort food, known for their creamy texture and cheesy goodness. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether this dish is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients typically used in au gratin potatoes, discuss potential sources of gluten, and provide tips for making or finding gluten-free versions of this classic dish.</p>

<h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Au Gratin Potatoes</h2>

<p>While the base ingredients of au gratin potatoes are generally gluten-free, there are a few areas where gluten can sneak in:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Breadcrumbs:</strong> Traditional breadcrumbs are made from wheat and are not gluten-free. However, gluten-free breadcrumbs are available and can be used as a substitute.</li>
    <li><strong>Flour as a Thickener:</strong> Some recipes call for flour to thicken the cream sauce. Wheat flour contains gluten, so it’s important to use a gluten-free alternative like cornstarch or a gluten-free flour blend.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-Packaged Mixes:</strong> Some pre-packaged au gratin potato mixes may contain gluten as a thickener or in the seasoning. Always read the label carefully.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>4 large potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups shredded cheese (cheddar or Gruyère)</li>

    <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup gluten-free breadcrumbs (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
