<h1>Is Krackel Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, determining whether a product is gluten-free is crucial. One popular treat that often comes into question is Krackel, a chocolate bar produced by Hershey's. In this article, we will delve into whether Krackel is gluten-free, explore its ingredients, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>What is Krackel?</h2>

<p>Krackel is a chocolate bar made by Hershey's, known for its unique combination of milk chocolate and crispy rice. The crispy rice gives the bar a delightful crunch, making it a favorite among chocolate lovers. However, for those who need to avoid gluten, the presence of crispy rice raises questions about the bar's safety.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Krackel</h2>

<p>To determine whether Krackel is gluten-free, it's essential to examine its ingredients. Here is a list of the primary ingredients found in a standard Krackel bar:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Milk Chocolate (Sugar, Cocoa Butter, Chocolate, Nonfat Milk, Milk Fat, Lactose, Soy Lecithin, PGPR, Emulsifier, Vanillin, Artificial Flavor)</li>
    <li>Crisped Rice (Rice, Sugar, Salt, Malt Flavoring)</li>
</ul>

<p>The key ingredient to focus on here is the crisped rice, which contains malt flavoring. Malt flavoring is often derived from barley, a gluten-containing grain. This raises concerns about whether Krackel is safe for those on a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>Is Krackel Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>According to Hershey's, Krackel is not considered gluten-free. The presence of malt flavoring in the crisped rice means that the product contains gluten. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming Krackel could lead to adverse health effects.</p>

<p>It's important to note that while some products may contain gluten, they may still be labeled as "gluten-free" if they contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. However, in the case of Krackel, Hershey's has explicitly stated that the product is not gluten-free due to the malt flavoring.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Krackel</h2>

<p>If you're a fan of the crispy texture of Krackel but need to avoid gluten, there are several gluten-free alternatives available. Here are a few options:</p>

    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Product</th>
