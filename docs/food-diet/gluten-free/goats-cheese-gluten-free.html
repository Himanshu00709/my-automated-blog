<h1>Goat Cheese: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

<p>Goat cheese, also known as ch√®vre, has been a staple in many cuisines for centuries. Its unique tangy flavor and creamy texture make it a versatile ingredient in both savory and sweet dishes. For those following a gluten-free diet, goat cheese is an excellent choice, as it is naturally free from gluten.

However, it's always important to check the label, as some flavored or processed goat cheeses may contain additives that include gluten.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits of Goat Cheese</h2>

<p>Goat cheese is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. Here are some of the key nutritional benefits:</p>
