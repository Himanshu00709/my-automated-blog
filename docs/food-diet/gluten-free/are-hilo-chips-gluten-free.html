<h1>Are HiLo Chips Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. For those who must avoid gluten, finding safe and delicious snack options can be a challenge. One popular snack that often comes under scrutiny is HiLo chips. But are HiLo chips gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to determine whether HiLo chips are a safe choice for those on a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What Are HiLo Chips?</h2>

<p>HiLo chips are a type of snack chip that has gained popularity for their unique texture and flavor. They are often marketed as a healthier alternative to traditional potato chips, with a focus on being low in calories and high in fiber. HiLo chips are made from a blend of ingredients, including corn, rice, and sometimes potato starch, which gives them their distinctive crunch. But the key question remains: do these ingredients contain gluten?</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is responsible for the elasticity and chewiness in many baked goods. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions. Therefore, it’s crucial to identify whether a product contains gluten or is processed in a facility that handles gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in HiLo Chips</h2>

<p>To determine whether HiLo chips are gluten-free, we need to examine their ingredients list. Typically, HiLo chips contain the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Cornmeal</li>
    <li>Rice flour</li>
    <li>Potato starch</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Seasonings</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, these ingredients do not contain gluten. However, it’s essential to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process. Cross-contamination can occur if the chips are produced in a facility that also processes wheat, barley, or rye.</p>

<h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination</h2>

<p>Even if the ingredients in HiLo chips are gluten-free, the manufacturing process can introduce gluten through cross-contamination. Many snack food manufacturers produce a variety of products in the same facility, some of which may contain gluten. To ensure that HiLo chips are safe for those with gluten sensitivities, it’s important to look for certifications or statements from the manufacturer regarding their production practices.</p>

<p>Some manufacturers will clearly label their products as "gluten-free" if they meet the necessary criteria, which typically includes testing for gluten levels below 20 parts per million (ppm). If HiLo chips are certified gluten-free, this would be a strong indication that they are safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

<h2>Certifications and Labels</h2>

<p>When it comes to gluten-free products, certifications and labels can provide additional assurance. Look for the following on the packaging of HiLo chips:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Gluten-Free Certification:</strong> This indicates that the product has been tested and meets the gluten-free standards set by a recognized certification body.</li>
    <li><strong>Manufacturer’s Statement:</strong> Some manufacturers will include a statement on their packaging indicating that the product is gluten-free or produced in a gluten-free facility.</li>
</ul>

<p>If HiLo chips carry any of these labels, it’s a good sign that they are safe for those avoiding gluten. However, if there is no such label, it’s best to contact the manufacturer directly for clarification.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Information</h2>

<p>In addition to being gluten-free, many people are interested in the nutritional profile of HiLo chips. Below is a table summarizing the typical nutritional information for HiLo chips:</p>
