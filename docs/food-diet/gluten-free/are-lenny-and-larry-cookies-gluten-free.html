In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to provide a comprehensive answer.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of health issues, including digestive problems, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. As a result, many individuals seek out gluten-free products to avoid these adverse effects.</p>

    <h2>Are Lenny & Larry Cookies Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Lenny & Larry's cookies are not entirely gluten-free. While the company offers a variety of flavors, most of their cookies contain ingredients derived from wheat, which means they contain gluten. However, Lenny & Larry does offer a few gluten-free options for those who need to avoid gluten. It’s important to carefully read the labels and ingredient lists to determine which cookies are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Options from Lenny & Larry</h3>

These cookies are made with alternative flours, such as almond flour or coconut flour, to replace wheat flour. Below is a table summarizing the gluten-free options available:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients to Watch Out For</h2>
    <p>When determining whether a Lenny & Larry cookie is gluten-free, it’s essential to scrutinize the ingredient list. Here are some common ingredients in Lenny & Larry cookies that may contain gluten:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wheat Flour:</strong> The primary source of gluten in most cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Oats:</strong> While oats are naturally gluten-free, they are often cross-contaminated with gluten during processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Barley Malt:</strong> A common sweetener that contains gluten.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you’re unsure about an ingredient, it’s always best to contact the manufacturer directly or look for a gluten-free certification on the packaging.</p>
