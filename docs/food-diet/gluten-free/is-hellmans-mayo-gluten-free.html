    <h1>Is Hellmann's Mayo Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Mayonnaise is a staple in many households, and Hellmann's is one of the most popular brands worldwide. For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, understanding whether Hellmann's mayonnaise is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to determine if Hellmann's mayo is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it’s essential to scrutinize food labels and understand the manufacturing processes of the products we consume.</p>

    <h2>Hellmann's Mayonnaise Ingredients</h2>

    <p>To determine if Hellmann's mayonnaise is gluten-free, let’s first examine its ingredients. The classic Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise contains the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Soybean oil</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Whole eggs and egg yolks</li>
        <li>Vinegar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Lemon juice concentrate</li>
        <li>Calcium disodium EDTA (to protect quality)</li>
        <li>Natural flavors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it’s important to consider cross-contamination during manufacturing and the presence of natural flavors, which can sometimes be derived from gluten-containing sources.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination</h2>

    <p>Hellmann's mayonnaise is produced in facilities that also handle other products, some of which may contain gluten. Cross-contamination can occur if shared equipment is not thoroughly cleaned between production runs. However, Hellmann's has stated that they follow strict cleaning protocols to minimize the risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>Additionally, Hellmann's has a dedicated allergen control program in place. They test their products to ensure they meet the FDA’s gluten-free standards, which require that products contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. This is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Certifications and Labels</h2>

    <p>While Hellmann's mayonnaise is not certified gluten-free by third-party organizations, the company has confirmed that their classic mayonnaise is gluten-free. They also provide a list of their gluten-free products on their website, which includes most of their mayonnaise varieties.</p>

    <p>Here’s a table summarizing the gluten-free status of popular Hellmann's mayonnaise products:</p>
