    <h1>Are Arepas Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Arepas are a staple in many Latin American cuisines, particularly in Colombia and Venezuela. These delicious, versatile corn cakes have gained popularity worldwide due to their simplicity and adaptability. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Are arepas gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients, preparation methods, and potential pitfalls to help you enjoy arepas without worry.</p>

    <h2>What Are Arepas?</h2>

    <p>Arepas are round, flatbread-like cakes made primarily from pre-cooked cornmeal, known as <em>masarepa</em> or <em>harina de maíz</em>. They can be grilled, baked, or fried and are often stuffed with a variety of fillings, such as cheese, meats, or beans. Their versatility makes them a popular choice for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p>

    <h2>Are Arepas Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The primary ingredient in arepas is cornmeal, which is naturally gluten-free. Corn does not contain gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Therefore, traditional arepas made with 100% cornmeal are safe for those following a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <p>However, it’s essential to consider the following factors to ensure your arepas remain gluten-free:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Always check the label of the cornmeal you’re using to ensure it hasn’t been cross-contaminated with gluten-containing grains during processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> If you’re making arepas at home, ensure that your cooking utensils and surfaces are free from gluten residues.</li>
        <li><strong>Fillings:</strong> Be cautious with fillings and toppings, as some may contain gluten. For example, certain processed meats or sauces might have gluten additives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Arepa Recipes</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free arepas at home is straightforward. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

                <td>1-2 tbsp</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the cornmeal, warm water, and salt until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rest for 5-10 minutes to absorb the moisture.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into equal portions and shape them into round patties.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly oil the surface.</li>
        <li>Cook the arepas for about 5-7 minutes on each side, until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Slice open and fill with your favorite gluten-free ingredients.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>While arepas are naturally gluten-free, there are some risks of gluten contamination to be aware of:</p>
