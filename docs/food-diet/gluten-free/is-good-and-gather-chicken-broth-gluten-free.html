    <h1>Is Good & Gather Chicken Broth Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Chicken broth is a staple in many kitchens, used as a base for soups, stews, and sauces. For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, ensuring that the products they consume are gluten-free is crucial. One popular brand, Good & Gather, has gained attention for its quality and affordability. But is Good & Gather chicken broth gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to answer this question definitively.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Presence in Food</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it’s essential to scrutinize food labels and understand the potential sources of gluten in everyday products.</p>

    <h2>Good & Gather Chicken Broth: Ingredients Breakdown</h2>

    <p>Good & Gather is Target’s private-label brand, known for offering high-quality products at competitive prices. Let’s take a closer look at the ingredients listed on the label of Good & Gather chicken broth:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Potential Gluten Source?</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Chicken Stock</td>
                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Natural Flavor</td>
                <td>Possibly (depending on source)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Yeast Extract</td>
                <td>No</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Vegetable Stock (Carrot, Celery, Onion)</td>
                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Spices</td>

    <p>From the table above, it’s clear that most of the ingredients in Good & Gather chicken broth are naturally gluten-free. However, the term “natural flavor” can sometimes be a gray area, as it may include derivatives of gluten-containing grains. To be certain, it’s important to look for additional information on the packaging or contact the manufacturer directly.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if a product’s ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can pose a risk. This occurs when gluten-free products are processed on the same equipment as gluten-containing products, leading to trace amounts of gluten in the final product. Good & Gather chicken broth is produced in facilities that may also handle gluten-containing ingredients, so cross-contamination is a possibility.</p>

    <p>For individuals with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease, it’s advisable to look for products that are certified gluten-free. These certifications ensure that the product has been tested and meets strict gluten-free standards, typically containing less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</p>

    <h2>Is Good & Gather Chicken Broth Certified Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>As of the latest information available, Good & Gather chicken broth does not carry a gluten-free certification. While the ingredients list suggests that the product is likely gluten-free, the absence of certification means that there is no guarantee against cross-contamination. For those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, this lack of certification may be a concern.</p>
