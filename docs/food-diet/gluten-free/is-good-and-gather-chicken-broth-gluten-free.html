<h1>Is Good & Gather Chicken Broth Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>Chicken broth is a staple in many kitchens, used for soups, stews, and as a base for various recipes. For individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, ensuring that their chicken broth is gluten-free is crucial. Good & Gather, a popular brand available at Target, offers a range of products, including chicken broth. But is Good & Gather chicken broth gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore this question in detail, providing you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Presence in Food Products</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it’s essential for these individuals to carefully scrutinize food labels to ensure that the products they consume are gluten-free.</p>

<p>When it comes to chicken broth, gluten can sometimes be present due to additives, flavorings, or cross-contamination during manufacturing. This is why it’s important to verify whether a specific brand of chicken broth is gluten-free.</p>

<h2>Good & Gather Chicken Broth: Ingredients and Gluten-Free Status</h2>
