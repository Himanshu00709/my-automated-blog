    <h1>Are Red Robin French Fries Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can be a challenge. One of the most common questions is whether popular restaurant items, like Red Robin's famous French fries, are gluten-free. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, preparation methods, and potential cross-contamination risks associated with Red Robin’s French fries. Whether you’re a gluten-free veteran or newly diagnosed, this guide will help you make informed decisions about your dining choices.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to long-term health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial to know whether the foods you eat contain gluten or are at risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Are Red Robin French Fries Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Red Robin is known for its gourmet burgers and bottomless steak fries, but are these fries safe for those avoiding gluten? According to Red Robin’s official allergen menu, their steak fries are <strong>gluten-free</strong>. However, there are some important considerations to keep in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Red Robin’s steak fries are made from potatoes, vegetable oil, and salt. These ingredients are naturally gluten-free.</li>
