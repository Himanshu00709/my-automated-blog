<h1>Gluten-Free Living in Singapore: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Living a gluten-free lifestyle can be challenging, especially in a bustling city like Singapore where food is a central part of the culture. However, with the increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders and the growing demand for gluten-free options, Singapore has become a haven for those who need to avoid gluten. Whether you have celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply choose to avoid gluten for health reasons, this guide will help you navigate the gluten-free scene in Singapore with ease.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine, while non-celiac gluten sensitivity involves similar symptoms without the autoimmune response.</p>

<p>In Singapore, the prevalence of celiac disease is relatively low, but the number of people adopting gluten-free diets for health reasons is on the rise. This has led to an increase in gluten-free products and dining options across the city.</p>

<p>Singapore is a food paradise, and the good news is that there are plenty of gluten-free dining options available. From hawker centers to fine dining restaurants, you can find gluten-free meals that cater to your dietary needs. Here are some popular gluten-free-friendly eateries in Singapore:</p>
