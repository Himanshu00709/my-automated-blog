<h1>Are Mission Wraps Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. For those who must avoid gluten, finding safe and delicious alternatives to traditional wheat-based products is essential. One popular product that often comes under scrutiny is Mission Wraps. Are Mission Wraps gluten-free? This article delves into the details, providing a comprehensive guide to help you make informed decisions.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to severe autoimmune reactions. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity, on the other hand, involves symptoms similar to celiac disease but without the intestinal damage.</p>

<p>Given the potential health risks, it's crucial for individuals with these conditions to avoid gluten-containing foods. This has led to a surge in the availability of gluten-free products, including wraps, bread, and pasta. However, not all products labeled as "gluten-free" are created equal, and understanding the specifics is key.</p>

<h2>Are Mission Wraps Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Mission Foods, a leading brand in the tortilla and wrap market, offers a variety of products, including traditional flour tortillas, whole wheat tortillas, and specialty wraps. The question of whether Mission Wraps are gluten-free depends on the specific product in question.</p>

<p>Mission Foods does produce gluten-free wraps, but not all of their products are gluten-free. Their gluten-free wraps are specifically labeled as such and are made with alternative flours like rice flour and tapioca starch. These wraps are designed to cater to individuals who need to avoid gluten while still enjoying the convenience and versatility of wraps.</p>
