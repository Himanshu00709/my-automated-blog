    <h1>Are Mellow Mushroom Wings Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>
    <p>Mellow Mushroom is a popular pizza chain known for its eclectic atmosphere and creative menu offerings. While their pizzas are the star of the show, their wings have also gained a loyal following. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Mellow Mushroom wings are gluten-free is a critical one. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, preparation methods, and options available for gluten-free diners at Mellow Mushroom.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions. As a result, many people are vigilant about avoiding gluten in their diets, especially when dining out.</p>
    <p>When it comes to restaurant food, cross-contamination is a significant concern. Even if a dish is made with gluten-free ingredients, it can still come into contact with gluten during preparation, cooking, or serving. This is why it’s essential to understand not just the ingredients but also the kitchen practices of the restaurant you’re dining at.</p>

    <h2>Are Mellow Mushroom Wings Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Mellow Mushroom offers a variety of wing flavors, including classic Buffalo, BBQ, and Jerk. The good news is that their wings are made with gluten-free ingredients. However, the preparation process is where things get a bit more complicated.</p>
    <p>According to Mellow Mushroom’s official allergen menu, their wings are gluten-free, but they are cooked in a shared fryer. This means that there is a risk of cross-contamination with gluten-containing foods, such as breaded items or fried foods that contain gluten. For individuals with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease, this could be a concern.</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Wing Options at Mellow Mushroom</h3>
    <p>If you’re looking for a completely gluten-free experience, Mellow Mushroom does offer some alternatives. Here’s a breakdown of their wing options:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Wing Flavor</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Ingredients</th>
                <th>Risk of Cross-Contamination</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Buffalo Wings</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
                <td>High (shared fryer)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>BBQ Wings</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
                <td>High (shared fryer)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Jerk Wings</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
                <td>High (shared fryer)</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
