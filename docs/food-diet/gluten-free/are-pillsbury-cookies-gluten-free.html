<h1>Are Pillsbury Cookies Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding safe and delicious baked goods can be a challenge. Pillsbury, a household name in the baking industry, offers a wide range of cookie dough products that are convenient and tasty. But are Pillsbury cookies gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free options available from Pillsbury, discuss the ingredients used, and provide tips for those following a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to manage their health.</p>

<p>When it comes to baked goods like cookies, gluten plays a crucial role in providing structure and texture. Gluten-free baking requires alternative ingredients to achieve similar results, which can be a challenge for manufacturers. Pillsbury has recognized this need and has introduced gluten-free options to cater to this growing market.</p>

<h2>Pillsbury’s Gluten-Free Cookie Options</h2>

Additionally, Pillsbury ensures that these products are produced in facilities that minimize the risk of cross-contamination with gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

<h2>Ingredients to Watch Out For</h2>

<p>While Pillsbury’s gluten-free cookies are safe for most people with gluten sensitivities, it’s always important to read the ingredient list carefully. Some ingredients that may be of concern include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Modified Food Starch:</strong> This can be derived from wheat, so it’s important to ensure that it’s sourced from a gluten-free source like corn or potatoes.</li>
    <li><strong>Natural Flavors:</strong> These can sometimes contain gluten, so it’s best to verify with the manufacturer if you’re unsure.</li>
    <li><strong>Oats:</strong> While oats are naturally gluten-free, they are often processed in facilities that handle wheat, leading to cross-contamination. Look for oats that are certified gluten-free.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pillsbury’s gluten-free products are designed to avoid these pitfalls, but it’s always a good idea to double-check the packaging for any updates or changes in ingredients.</p>

<h2>Tips for Baking Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>

<p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit different from traditional baking. Here are some tips to ensure your Pillsbury gluten-free cookies turn out perfectly:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Follow the Instructions:</strong> Gluten-free dough may behave differently, so it’s important to follow the baking instructions on the package carefully.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Parchment Paper:</strong> To prevent sticking, line your baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overbake:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can dry out quickly, so keep an eye on them and remove them from the oven as soon as they’re done.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to add your favorite gluten-free mix-ins like chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruit to customize your cookies.</li>
