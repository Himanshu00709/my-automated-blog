    <h1>Are Charleston Chews Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Charleston Chews are a classic American candy that has been enjoyed for decades. Known for their chewy, nougat center and chocolatey coating, these treats are a favorite among candy lovers. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Charleston Chews are gluten-free is of utmost importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential risks associated with Charleston Chews to determine if they are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it is crucial for those on a gluten-free diet to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and manufacturing processes of the foods they consume.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Charleston Chews</h2>

    <p>To determine if Charleston Chews are gluten-free, we must first examine their ingredients. The primary components of Charleston Chews include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Nougat (sugar, corn syrup, egg whites, and artificial flavors)</li>
        <li>Chocolate coating (sugar, cocoa butter, chocolate liquor, and soy lecithin)</li>
        <li>Additional flavorings and stabilizers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it's important to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process, which we will explore in the next section.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if a product's ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can introduce gluten into the final product. This is particularly concerning for individuals with celiac disease, who must avoid even trace amounts of gluten.</p>

    <p>Charleston Chews are produced by Tootsie Roll Industries, a company that manufactures a wide range of candies, some of which may contain gluten. While Tootsie Roll Industries has not explicitly stated that Charleston Chews are gluten-free, they do provide allergen information on their packaging and website. It is always recommended to check the packaging for the most up-to-date information regarding allergens and gluten content.</p>

    <h2>Are Charleston Chews Certified Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>As of the latest information available, Charleston Chews are not certified gluten-free by any recognized gluten-free certification organization. Certification typically involves rigorous testing and adherence to strict manufacturing standards to ensure that products contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most individuals with celiac disease.</p>

    <p>Without this certification, it is difficult to guarantee that Charleston Chews are entirely free from gluten. However, based on the ingredients list and the absence of gluten-containing ingredients, many individuals with gluten sensitivity may still choose to consume Charleston Chews in moderation.</p>

    <h2>Comparing Charleston Chews to Other Gluten-Free Candies</h2>

    <p>For those who are particularly cautious about gluten, it may be helpful to compare Charleston Chews to other candies that are certified gluten-free. Below is a table comparing Charleston Chews to some popular gluten-free candy options:</p>
