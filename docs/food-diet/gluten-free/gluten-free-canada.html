    <h1>Gluten-Free Living in Canada: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Living a gluten-free lifestyle in Canada has become increasingly accessible over the years. Whether you have celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply choose to avoid gluten for health reasons, Canada offers a wide range of resources, products, and dining options to support your dietary needs. This guide will explore the gluten-free landscape in Canada, including where to shop, dine, and find support, as well as tips for maintaining a balanced gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to a host of health issues. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is another condition where individuals experience symptoms similar to celiac disease but without the intestinal damage. In both cases, a strict gluten-free diet is essential for managing symptoms and maintaining overall health.</p>

    <p>Canada has made significant strides in raising awareness about gluten-related disorders. The Canadian Celiac Association (CCA) is a leading organization that provides education, resources, and support for individuals living gluten-free. They also work closely with food manufacturers and restaurants to ensure safe gluten-free options are available.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Shopping in Canada</h2>

    <p>Finding gluten-free products in Canada has never been easier. Most major grocery stores, such as Loblaws, Sobeys, and Metro, have dedicated gluten-free sections. Additionally, specialty stores like Whole Foods Market and Bulk Barn offer a wide variety of gluten-free products, from baking mixes to snacks and pantry staples.</p>

    <p>Here’s a table showcasing some popular gluten-free brands available in Canada:</p>
