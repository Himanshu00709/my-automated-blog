Jonny Pops are made with real fruit, organic cane sugar, and other natural ingredients, making them a favorite among health-conscious consumers.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

<p>However, it's important to note that while Jonny Pops do not contain gluten ingredients, they are not certified gluten-free.
