    <h1>Is Frank's Buffalo Sauce Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Frank's RedHot Buffalo Sauce is a staple in many kitchens, known for its tangy, spicy flavor that enhances everything from chicken wings to dips. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether this beloved sauce is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to determine if Frank's Buffalo Sauce is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions. Therefore, it’s essential to scrutinize food labels and understand the manufacturing processes of products to ensure they are gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Frank's Buffalo Sauce</h2>

    <p>To determine if Frank's Buffalo Sauce is gluten-free, let’s first examine its ingredients. According to the label, the primary ingredients include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Aged Cayenne Red Peppers</li>
        <li>Distilled Vinegar</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Natural Butter Type Flavor</li>
        <li>Canola Oil</li>
        <li>Xanthan Gum</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it’s important to consider potential cross-contamination during manufacturing, which we’ll discuss later.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if a product’s ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can introduce gluten. Frank's RedHot products are manufactured in facilities that also process other products, some of which may contain gluten. However, the company has stated that they follow strict cleaning protocols to prevent cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>Additionally, Frank's RedHot Buffalo Sauce is labeled as gluten-free, which means it meets the FDA’s requirements for gluten-free labeling. This includes containing less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, a threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Certifications and Gluten-Free Claims</h2>

    <p>Frank's RedHot Buffalo Sauce is not certified gluten-free by a third-party organization like the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). However, the company’s gluten-free claim is based on internal testing and adherence to FDA guidelines. For many consumers, this is sufficient assurance, but those with severe gluten sensitivities may prefer products with third-party certifications.</p>
