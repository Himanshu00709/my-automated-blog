<h1>Is Kraft Barbeque Sauce Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>When it comes to dietary restrictions, particularly gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding the ingredients in your favorite foods is crucial. One common question that arises is whether Kraft Barbeque Sauce is gluten-free. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential cross-contamination risks associated with Kraft Barbeque Sauce to determine if it is safe for those on a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, identifying gluten-free products is essential for maintaining a healthy and symptom-free lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Kraft Barbeque Sauce</h2>

<p>To determine if Kraft Barbeque Sauce is gluten-free, we first need to examine its ingredients. The primary ingredients in Kraft Barbeque Sauce typically include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Tomato Puree</li>
    <li>High Fructose Corn Syrup</li>
    <li>Vinegar</li>
    <li>Molasses</li>
    <li>Modified Food Starch</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Spices</li>
    <li>Natural Smoke Flavor</li>
    <li>Caramel Color</li>
    <li>Garlic Powder</li>
    <li>Onion Powder</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, the devil is in the details, particularly with ingredients like modified food starch and natural flavors, which can sometimes be derived from gluten-containing sources.</p>

<h2>Is Modified Food Starch Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Modified food starch is a common ingredient in many processed foods, including sauces and condiments. It is used as a thickening agent and can be derived from various sources, including corn, potatoes, and wheat. In the United States, if modified food starch is derived from wheat, it must be listed on the label as "wheat starch." Kraft Barbeque Sauce does not list wheat starch as an ingredient, which suggests that the modified food starch used is likely derived from a gluten-free source, such as corn.</p>

<h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

<p>Even if the ingredients in Kraft Barbeque Sauce are gluten-free, there is still the potential for cross-contamination during the manufacturing process. Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free products are processed on the same equipment as gluten-containing products. Kraft Foods has stated that they take steps to prevent cross-contamination, but they do not guarantee that their products are entirely free from gluten. Therefore, individuals with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease should exercise caution.</p>

<h2>Kraft's Gluten-Free Labeling</h2>

<p>Kraft Foods has a policy of clearly labeling their products if they are gluten-free. If a product is labeled as gluten-free, it means that it contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold set by the FDA for gluten-free labeling. As of the latest information available, Kraft Barbeque Sauce does not carry a gluten-free label. This absence of labeling suggests that while the ingredients may be gluten-free, the product has not been certified as such by Kraft.</p>

<h2>Comparison of Kraft Barbeque Sauce with Other Brands</h2>
