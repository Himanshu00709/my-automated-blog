<h1>Are Sun-Dried Tomatoes Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Sun-dried tomatoes are a popular ingredient in many cuisines, known for their intense flavor and versatility. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, it's crucial to know whether these delicious morsels are safe to consume. In this article, we'll explore whether sun-dried tomatoes are gluten-free, how they are made, and what to look out for when purchasing them.</p>

<h2>What Are Sun-Dried Tomatoes?</h2>

<p>Sun-dried tomatoes are ripe tomatoes that have been dried in the sun to remove most of their moisture content. This process concentrates their flavor, making them a rich and tangy addition to salads, pasta, and other dishes. Traditionally, sun-dried tomatoes were made by laying tomatoes out in the sun for several days. Today, they are often dried using commercial dehydrators or ovens to speed up the process.</p>

<h2>Are Sun-Dried Tomatoes Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Tomatoes themselves are naturally gluten-free, as they are a fruit and do not contain any gluten proteins. However, the process of drying and packaging sun-dried tomatoes can introduce gluten contamination. Here are some factors to consider:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Processing Methods:</strong> Some manufacturers may use shared equipment or facilities that also process gluten-containing products, leading to cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Additives:</strong> Some sun-dried tomatoes may contain additives or preservatives that could include gluten. For example, certain brands might add flavorings or anti-caking agents that are not gluten-free.</li>
    <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> The packaging process itself can sometimes introduce gluten if the facility is not dedicated gluten-free.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Ensure Your Sun-Dried Tomatoes Are Gluten-Free</h2>

<p>If you have celiac disease or a gluten sensitivity, it's essential to take extra precautions when selecting sun-dried tomatoes. Here are some tips to ensure you're choosing a gluten-free product:</p>
