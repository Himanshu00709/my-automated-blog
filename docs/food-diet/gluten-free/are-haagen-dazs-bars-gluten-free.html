    <h2>Ingredients to Watch Out For</h2>

    <p>When determining if a Häagen-Dazs bar is gluten-free, it’s essential to examine the ingredient list. Some ingredients that may contain gluten include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Malt</strong>: Often derived from barley, which contains gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies or Cookie Dough</strong>: Typically made with wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Brownies or Cake Pieces</strong>: Often contain wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Barley Malt Extract</strong>: A common ingredient in some chocolate coatings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If any of these ingredients are listed, the product is not gluten-free. Additionally, some flavors may include additives or stabilizers that could contain gluten, so it’s always best to read the label carefully.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if a Häagen-Dazs bar is made with gluten-free ingredients, there’s always a risk of cross-contamination during production. Häagen-Dazs products are manufactured in facilities that may also process gluten-containing products. For individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, this could pose a risk. If you’re highly sensitive to gluten, consider reaching out to Häagen-Dazs directly for more information about their manufacturing processes.</p>
