<h2>What is Beef Consommé?</h2>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Stock:</strong> In a large pot, combine the beef bones, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, and parsley. Add cold water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for 4-6 hours, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface.</li>
    <li><strong>Strain the Stock:</strong> Once the stock has simmered, strain it through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove all solids. Discard the solids and return the liquid to the pot.</li>
    <li><strong>Clarify the Consommé:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until frothy. Slowly add the egg whites to the strained stock, stirring gently. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, and the egg whites will form a raft on the surface, trapping impurities. After 10-15 minutes, carefully strain the consommé through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth again to remove the raft.</li>
    <li><strong>Season and Serve:</strong> Season the consommé with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.</li>
</ol>
