    <h1>Gluten-Free Grits: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Grits, a staple in Southern cuisine, have been enjoyed for centuries. Traditionally made from ground corn, grits are a versatile dish that can be served for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding gluten-free grits can be a challenge. In this article, we'll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free grits, from their nutritional benefits to how to prepare them at home.</p>

    <h2>What Are Grits?</h2>
    <p>Grits are a type of porridge made from ground corn, specifically from a variety called dent corn. The corn is treated with an alkali in a process called nixtamalization, which removes the hull and germ, leaving behind the endosperm. This endosperm is then ground into a coarse meal, which is used to make grits. Grits can be found in various forms, including stone-ground, quick-cooking, and instant.</p>

    <h2>Are Grits Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Yes, grits are naturally gluten-free because they are made from corn, which does not contain gluten. However, cross-contamination can occur during processing, packaging, or preparation, especially if the grits are processed in facilities that also handle wheat, barley, or rye. Therefore, it's essential to look for grits that are certified gluten-free if you have celiac disease or a severe gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Grits</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free grits are not only safe for those with gluten sensitivities, but they also offer several nutritional benefits. Here’s a breakdown of the key nutrients found in a typical serving of gluten-free grits:</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Grits</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use instant grits if I need gluten-free options?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use instant grits as long as they are labeled gluten-free. However, keep in mind that instant grits may have a different texture and flavor compared to traditional stone-ground grits.</p>

        <p>Gluten-free grits can be served in a variety of ways. Try them as a base for shrimp and grits, topped with cheese and bacon, or even as a sweet dish with honey and fruit.</p>
