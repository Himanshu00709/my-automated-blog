<h1>Is Sweet Chilli Sauce Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Sweet chilli sauce is a popular condiment that adds a delightful balance of sweetness and heat to a variety of dishes. Whether you're drizzling it over spring rolls, using it as a dipping sauce, or incorporating it into marinades, sweet chilli sauce is a versatile addition to any kitchen. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether sweet chilli sauce is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we'll explore the ingredients commonly found in sweet chilli sauce, discuss potential sources of gluten, and provide tips for ensuring that your sweet chilli sauce is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It acts as a binding agent, giving elasticity to dough and helping it rise. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it's crucial to identify and avoid gluten-containing ingredients in food products, including condiments like sweet chilli sauce.</p>

<h2>Common Ingredients in Sweet Chilli Sauce</h2>

<p>Sweet chilli sauce typically contains a combination of the following ingredients:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Chilli peppers</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Vinegar</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Thickening agents (e.g., cornstarch, tapioca starch)</li>
    <li>Preservatives</li>
</ul>

<p>While many of these ingredients are naturally gluten-free, some may pose a risk of gluten contamination, especially if they are processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products. Let's take a closer look at the potential sources of gluten in sweet chilli sauce.</p>
