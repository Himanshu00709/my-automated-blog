    <h1>Are Butterscotch Chips Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Butterscotch chips are a beloved ingredient in many desserts, from cookies to brownies and beyond. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, determining whether butterscotch chips are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients in butterscotch chips, their potential gluten content, and how to ensure you’re choosing a safe option for your gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Butterscotch Chips Made Of?</h2>

    <p>Butterscotch chips are small, sweet morsels used in baking. They are typically made from a combination of sugar, brown sugar, butter, and vanilla. The primary ingredients include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Brown sugar</li>
        <li>Hydrogenated palm kernel oil</li>

        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Emulsifiers (such as soy lecithin)</li>
        <li>Artificial flavors</li>
