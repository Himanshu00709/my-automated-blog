    <h1>Gluten-Free Passover: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Passover, or Pesach, is one of the most significant Jewish holidays, commemorating the liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery. Central to the celebration is the Seder meal, which includes a variety of symbolic foods. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, Passover can present unique challenges. This guide will help you navigate a gluten-free Passover with ease, offering tips, recipes, and insights to ensure a meaningful and delicious celebration.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Passover</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. During Passover, the consumption of chametz (leavened products made from these grains) is prohibited. While this might seem like a natural fit for a gluten-free diet, it's important to note that many Passover products are made with matzah, which is typically made from wheat and therefore contains gluten. However, there are gluten-free alternatives available that adhere to Passover dietary laws.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Passover Foods</h2>

    <p>When planning a gluten-free Passover, it's essential to focus on naturally gluten-free foods and certified gluten-free products. Here are some key categories to consider:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Category</th>
                <th>Examples</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Grains and Flours</td>
                <td>Quinoa, almond flour, coconut flour, potato starch, tapioca starch</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Proteins</td>
                <td>Beef, chicken, fish, eggs, legumes (for those who eat kitniyot)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Fruits and Vegetables</td>
                <td>All fresh fruits and vegetables</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Dairy</td>
                <td>Milk, cheese, yogurt (ensure they are gluten-free and kosher for Passover)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Snacks and Desserts</td>
                <td>Gluten-free matzah, macaroons, chocolate, nuts, dried fruits</td>
            </tr>
