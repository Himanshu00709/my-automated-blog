    <h1>Is Jello Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Jello, a popular dessert known for its wobbly texture and vibrant colors, is a favorite among many. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, determining whether Jello is safe to consume is crucial. In this article, we will explore whether Jello is gluten-free, delve into its ingredients, and provide tips for those following a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Jello?</h2>
    <p>Jello, also known as gelatin dessert, is a sweetened and flavored product made primarily from gelatin, sugar, and artificial flavors. Gelatin, the key ingredient, is derived from animal collagen, typically from bones and connective tissues. Jello is available in various flavors and is often used in desserts, salads, and even as a base for some medical preparations.</p>

    <h2>Is Jello Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>The good news for those avoiding gluten is that traditional Jello is generally considered gluten-free. The primary ingredients—gelatin, sugar, and artificial flavors—do not contain gluten. However, it's essential to read the label carefully, as some flavored varieties or brands may include additives or cross-contamination risks that could introduce gluten.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients to Watch Out For</h3>
