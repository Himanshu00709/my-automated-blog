    <h1>Corn Tortillas and Gluten: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Corn tortillas are a staple in many cuisines, particularly in Latin American cultures. They are versatile, delicious, and can be used in a variety of dishes, from tacos to enchiladas. But for those who need to avoid gluten, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, understanding the relationship between corn tortillas and gluten is crucial. This article will delve into the details of corn tortillas, their gluten content, and how they fit into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Corn Tortillas?</h2>

    <p>Corn tortillas are thin, flatbreads made from masa harina, a type of corn flour that has been treated with lime (calcium hydroxide) in a process called nixtamalization. This process not only enhances the nutritional value of the corn but also gives the tortillas their distinctive flavor and texture. Corn tortillas have been a dietary staple in Mesoamerican cultures for thousands of years and remain a fundamental part of Mexican cuisine today.</p>

    <h2>Are Corn Tortillas Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, traditional corn tortillas are naturally gluten-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. Since corn tortillas are made from corn, which is a gluten-free grain, they do not contain gluten. However, it's important to note that not all corn tortillas are created equal. Some commercially produced corn tortillas may contain additives or be processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products, which could lead to cross-contamination.</p>

    <h3>Key Points to Consider:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Always check the ingredient list to ensure that the tortillas are made solely from corn, water, and lime. Avoid any tortillas that list wheat flour or other gluten-containing ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If you have celiac disease or a severe gluten intolerance, look for corn tortillas that are certified gluten-free. This certification ensures that the product has been tested and meets strict gluten-free standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Homemade Tortillas:</strong> Making corn tortillas at home is another way to ensure they are gluten-free. You can control the ingredients and the preparation process to avoid any risk of cross-contamination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Corn Tortillas</h2>

    <p>Corn tortillas are not only gluten-free but also offer several nutritional benefits. They are a good source of fiber, which aids in digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut. Additionally, corn tortillas are low in fat and calories, making them a healthier alternative to flour tortillas, especially for those who are watching their weight.</p>
