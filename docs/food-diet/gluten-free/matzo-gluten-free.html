    <h1>Matzo Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Matzo, also known as matzah, is a traditional unleavened bread that holds significant cultural and religious importance, particularly in Jewish cuisine. Traditionally made from wheat flour and water, matzo is a staple during Passover, a Jewish holiday that commemorates the Exodus from Egypt. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, consuming traditional matzo can be problematic. This has led to the rise of gluten-free matzo, a safe and delicious alternative that allows everyone to partake in this cherished tradition. In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free matzo, including its history, ingredients, nutritional benefits, and how to make it at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Matzo?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free matzo is a variation of traditional matzo that is made without gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, rye, or spelt. Instead, it is typically made from gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or a blend of gluten-free grains such as rice, quinoa, or tapioca. The preparation process remains similar to traditional matzo, where the dough is quickly mixed and baked to prevent any leavening, ensuring it remains unleavened.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Matzo?</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. Gluten-free matzo provides a safe alternative that allows these individuals to participate in Passover traditions without compromising their health. Additionally, gluten-free matzo can be a healthier option for those looking to reduce their gluten intake, as it often contains nutrient-dense ingredients like almond flour or quinoa.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Matzo</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free matzo can offer several nutritional benefits, depending on the ingredients used. For example, matzo made with almond flour is rich in healthy fats, protein, and fiber, while quinoa-based matzo provides a complete protein source with all essential amino acids. Below is a comparison of the nutritional content of traditional wheat matzo versus gluten-free matzo made with almond flour:</p>
