    <li><strong>Incorporate Gluten-Free Alternatives:</strong> Use gluten-free versions of bread, pasta, and crackers. Many brands now offer high-quality gluten-free products that closely mimic their gluten-containing counterparts.</li>
    <li><strong>Focus on Texture and Flavor:</strong> Picky eaters often have strong preferences for certain textures and flavors. Experiment with different cooking methods, such as roasting, grilling, or steaming, to find what works best.</li>
