    <h1>Are Carnitas Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Carnitas, a traditional Mexican dish made from slow-cooked pork, is a favorite among food enthusiasts. Its tender, flavorful meat is often used in tacos, burritos, and other dishes. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Are carnitas gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients, preparation methods, and potential gluten-containing pitfalls to help you enjoy carnitas safely.</p>

    <h2>What Are Carnitas?</h2>
    <p>Carnitas, which translates to "little meats," is a dish made by braising or simmering pork in lard or oil until tender. The meat is then shredded and often crisped up before serving. Traditional carnitas are seasoned with simple ingredients like garlic, oregano, and citrus juices, making them a naturally gluten-free option. However, the gluten-free status of carnitas can vary depending on the preparation method and additional ingredients used.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Traditional Carnitas</h2>
    <p>Traditional carnitas are made with a few basic ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork shoulder or butt</li>
        <li>Lard or oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Citrus juices (usually orange or lime)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These ingredients are inherently gluten-free, which means that, in their purest form, carnitas should be safe for those avoiding gluten. However, cross-contamination or the addition of certain sauces and seasonings can introduce gluten into the dish.</p>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Carnitas</h2>
    <p>While traditional carnitas are gluten-free, there are several ways gluten can sneak into the dish:</p>

                <td>Cross-Contamination</td>
                <td>If carnitas are prepared in a kitchen that also handles gluten-containing foods, cross-contamination can occur. This is especially common in restaurants.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Pre-Made Carnitas</td>
