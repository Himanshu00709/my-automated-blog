    <h1>Gluten-Free Milton: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by an increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders such as celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergies. Milton, a town known for its vibrant community and diverse culinary scene, has embraced this trend with open arms. Whether you're a resident or a visitor, navigating the gluten-free options in Milton can be a delightful experience.

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and skin problems. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity, on the other hand, involves similar symptoms but without the intestinal damage. Understanding these conditions is crucial for anyone considering a gluten-free diet.</p>
