    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Truffle Fries</h2>

    <p>While the primary ingredients in truffle fries are gluten-free, there are several potential sources of gluten that could be introduced during the preparation process:</p>

    <ul>

        <li><strong>Seasonings and Additives:</strong> Some truffle oils and salts may contain additives or flavorings that include gluten. It's essential to read labels carefully or ask the manufacturer for clarification.</li>
        <li><strong>Parmesan Cheese:</strong> While Parmesan cheese is typically gluten-free, some brands may use anti-caking agents that contain gluten. Always check the label or inquire with the restaurant.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Ensure Your Truffle Fries Are Gluten-Free</h2>

    <p>If you have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it's crucial to take extra precautions when ordering truffle fries. Here are some tips to ensure your truffle fries are gluten-free:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Ask About the Frying Oil:</strong> Inquire whether the fries are cooked in a dedicated gluten-free fryer or if the oil is shared with gluten-containing foods.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the Ingredients:</strong> Request a list of ingredients used in the truffle fries, including the truffle oil, salt, and cheese. Look for any hidden sources of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Communicate with the Staff:</strong> Inform the restaurant staff about your gluten intolerance or celiac disease. A knowledgeable staff member can guide you in making a safe choice.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Certified Gluten-Free Products:</strong> If you're making truffle fries at home, opt for certified gluten-free truffle oil, salt, and cheese to eliminate any risk of gluten contamination.</li>
