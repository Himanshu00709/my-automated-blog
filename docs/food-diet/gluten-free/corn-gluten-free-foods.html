    <h1>Corn Gluten-Free Foods: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free foods has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the desire for healthier eating habits. Among the many gluten-free options available, corn-based foods have emerged as a popular choice. But is corn truly gluten-free? And what are the best corn-based gluten-free foods to incorporate into your diet? This article delves into the world of corn gluten-free foods, providing you with a detailed guide to help you make informed dietary choices.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to various health issues. Even for those without celiac disease, gluten sensitivity can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to improve their health and well-being.</p>

    <h2>Is Corn Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Yes, corn is naturally gluten-free. Unlike wheat, barley, and rye, corn does not contain the gluten proteins that cause issues for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it's important to note that while corn itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during processing or packaging. Therefore, it's crucial to look for certified gluten-free labels when purchasing corn-based products.</p>
