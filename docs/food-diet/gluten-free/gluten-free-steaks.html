    <h1>Gluten-Free Steaks: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>When it comes to enjoying a delicious steak, many people don't realize that gluten can sometimes be a hidden ingredient. Whether you're following a gluten-free diet due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, it's essential to know how to ensure your steak is truly gluten-free. In this guide, we'll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free steaks, from selecting the right cuts to preparing them safely.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Steak Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>At its core, steak is naturally gluten-free. Steak is made from beef, which does not contain gluten. However, the way steak is prepared, seasoned, and cooked can introduce gluten into the dish. For example, marinades, sauces, and seasonings often contain gluten-containing ingredients like soy sauce or wheat-based thickeners. Cross-contamination during cooking can also be a concern, especially in restaurants or shared kitchens.</p>

    <h2>Choosing the Right Cut of Steak</h2>
    <p>When selecting a steak, it's important to choose cuts that are free from added ingredients or coatings. Here are some popular gluten-free steak cuts:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Cut of Steak</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Ribeye</td>
                <td>A flavorful and tender cut with rich marbling.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Filet Mignon</td>
                <td>A lean and tender cut, often considered the most premium steak.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>New York Strip</td>
                <td>A well-marbled cut with a robust flavor.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sirloin</td>
                <td>A versatile and affordable cut with a good balance of flavor and tenderness.</td>
            </tr>
