    <h1>Are Fortune Cookies Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>
    <p>Fortune cookies are a staple in many Chinese-American restaurants, often served as a sweet ending to a meal. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Are fortune cookies gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients of fortune cookies, their gluten content, and alternatives for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What Are Fortune Cookies Made Of?</h2>
    <p>Fortune cookies are thin, crisp cookies that are typically made from a simple batter consisting of flour, sugar, vanilla, and oil. The batter is baked into thin, flat circles, which are then folded around a small piece of paper containing a "fortune" or a motivational message. The key ingredient that raises concerns for those avoiding gluten is the flour, which is usually wheat flour.</p>

    <h2>Are Fortune Cookies Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Traditional fortune cookies are not gluten-free because they are made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it is responsible for the elasticity and chewiness in baked goods. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions.</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Alternatives</h3>
    <p>For those who need to avoid gluten, there are gluten-free fortune cookies available on the market. These cookies are made with gluten-free flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or a blend of gluten-free flours. They are designed to mimic the texture and taste of traditional fortune cookies while being safe for those with gluten intolerance.</p>
