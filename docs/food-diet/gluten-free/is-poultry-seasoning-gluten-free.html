<p>As you can see, the primary ingredients in poultry seasoning are naturally gluten-free. However, the potential for gluten contamination can arise during the manufacturing process or from added ingredients that are not inherently gluten-free.</p>

<h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Poultry Seasoning</h2>

<p>While the core ingredients of poultry seasoning are gluten-free, there are a few potential sources of gluten to be aware of:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If the seasoning is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing products, there is a risk of cross-contamination. This is particularly concerning for individuals with celiac disease, who must avoid even trace amounts of gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Additives and Fillers:</strong> Some poultry seasoning blends may include additives or fillers that contain gluten. For example, certain anti-caking agents or flavor enhancers could be derived from gluten-containing grains.</li>
    <li><strong>Packaging and Labeling:</strong> Always check the packaging for any gluten-related warnings. Some brands may clearly label their products as gluten-free, while others may not provide this information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Ensure Your Poultry Seasoning is Gluten-Free</h2>

<p>If you’re following a gluten-free diet, here are some steps you can take to ensure your poultry seasoning is safe:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Read the Label:</strong> Carefully read the ingredient list and look for any gluten-containing ingredients. Also, check for a gluten-free certification or label.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact the Manufacturer:</strong> If the label is unclear, consider reaching out to the manufacturer for more information about their gluten-free practices.</li>
    <li><strong>Choose Certified Gluten-Free Brands:</strong> Opt for brands that are certified gluten-free by reputable organizations. These products are tested to ensure they meet strict gluten-free standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Make Your Own:</strong> If you’re concerned about gluten contamination, consider making your own poultry seasoning blend at home using gluten-free herbs and spices.</li>
