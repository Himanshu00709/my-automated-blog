    <p>As seen in the table above, the primary ingredients in Melona bars are naturally gluten-free. However, it's important to note that the term "natural flavors" can sometimes be a source of hidden gluten, depending on the source. Therefore, it's crucial to verify the gluten-free status of these flavors with the manufacturer.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients in Melona bars are gluten-free, there is always a risk of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process. Cross-contamination can occur if the same equipment is used to produce gluten-containing products, or if the facility is not dedicated to gluten-free production.</p>

    <p>To ensure the safety of their products, many manufacturers implement strict protocols to prevent cross-contamination. This includes thorough cleaning of equipment, dedicated production lines, and regular testing for gluten residues. However, not all manufacturers follow these practices, so it's essential to check the packaging for any gluten-free certifications or statements.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certifications and Labels</h2>

    <p>One of the most reliable ways to determine if a product is gluten-free is to look for gluten-free certifications on the packaging. These certifications are issued by third-party organizations that test and verify the gluten-free status of products. Some common gluten-free certifications include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO):</strong> Products with this certification contain less than 10 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Certified Gluten-Free by NSF:</strong> This certification ensures that the product meets strict gluten-free standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Labeling by FDA:</strong> In the United States, products labeled as "gluten-free" must contain less than 20 ppm of gluten.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If Melona bars carry any of these certifications, it is a strong indication that they are safe for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>
