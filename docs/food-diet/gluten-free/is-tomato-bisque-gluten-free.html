    <p>As you can see, most of the ingredients in tomato bisque are naturally gluten-free. However, there are a few potential sources of gluten that you need to be aware of, particularly flour and certain types of stock or alcohol.</p>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Tomato Bisque</h2>

    <p>While many of the ingredients in tomato bisque are naturally gluten-free, there are a few key areas where gluten can sneak in:</p>

    <h3>1. Flour as a Thickening Agent</h3>

    <p>One of the most common ways gluten can find its way into tomato bisque is through the use of flour as a thickening agent. Traditional recipes often call for a roux, which is a mixture of flour and fat (usually butter) used to thicken soups and sauces. If regular wheat flour is used, the bisque will contain gluten. However, there are gluten-free alternatives such as cornstarch, rice flour, or gluten-free all-purpose flour that can be used instead.</p>

    <h3>2. Stock or Broth</h3>

    <p>Another potential source of gluten is the stock or broth used in the soup. Some commercial stocks and broths may contain gluten as a flavor enhancer or thickening agent. It's essential to read the labels carefully or opt for brands that are certified gluten-free.</p>

    <h3>3. Alcohol (Sherry or Wine)</h3>

    <p>Some tomato bisque recipes call for a splash of sherry or wine to enhance the flavor. While most distilled alcohols are gluten-free, some wines and sherries may be processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products. Additionally, some wines may use gluten-based fining agents. Always check the label or contact the manufacturer to ensure the alcohol used is gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Tomato Bisque</h2>

    <p>If you're preparing tomato bisque at home and want to ensure it's gluten-free, here are some tips to follow:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Gluten-Free Thickeners:</strong> Instead of regular flour, use gluten-free alternatives like cornstarch, rice flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Gluten-Free Stock:</strong> Opt for stocks and broths that are labeled gluten-free. Many brands now offer gluten-free options, so be sure to read the labels carefully.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Alcohol Labels:</strong> If your recipe calls for sherry or wine, make sure to choose a brand that is certified gluten-free or contact the manufacturer to confirm its gluten-free status.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Cross-Contamination:</strong> If you're preparing gluten-free tomato bisque in a kitchen that also handles gluten-containing foods, be sure to clean all utensils, pots, and surfaces thoroughly to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>1. Is canned tomato bisque gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Not all canned tomato bisques are gluten-free. Some brands may use flour or other gluten-containing ingredients as thickeners. Always check the label for gluten-free certification or contact the manufacturer to confirm.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I use almond milk instead of cream in tomato bisque?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use almond milk or other non-dairy alternatives to make a dairy-free and gluten-free version of tomato bisque. Just be sure to choose a gluten-free thickener if needed.</p>

        <h3>3. Are all tomato soups gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Not all tomato soups are gluten-free. Some may contain flour or other gluten-containing ingredients. Always check the label or ask the manufacturer if you're unsure.</p>
