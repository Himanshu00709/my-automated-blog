    <h1>Is Sabra Hummus Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Hummus has become a staple in many households, offering a delicious and nutritious snack option. Among the many brands available, Sabra is one of the most popular. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Is Sabra hummus gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to provide a clear answer.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial for these individuals to ensure that the foods they consume are free from gluten.</p>

    <p>When it comes to hummus, the primary ingredients—chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, and spices—are naturally gluten-free. However, cross-contamination during manufacturing or the addition of gluten-containing ingredients can pose a risk. This is why it’s essential to examine the specific brand and product in question.</p>

    <h2>Sabra Hummus: Ingredients and Manufacturing</h2>

    <p>Sabra offers a wide variety of hummus flavors, each with its own unique ingredient list. The classic Sabra Hummus, for example, contains the following ingredients:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Chickpeas</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Tahini (ground sesame)</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Olive Oil</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Garlic</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Citric Acid</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Potassium Sorbate</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Natural Flavors</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As you can see, the primary ingredients in Sabra Hummus are naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that Sabra does not label their hummus as “gluten-free” on the packaging. This is because the product is manufactured in facilities that also process gluten-containing ingredients, which could lead to cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free products come into contact with gluten-containing products during manufacturing. This can happen through shared equipment, storage facilities, or even during transportation. For individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, even trace amounts of gluten can trigger symptoms.</p>

    <p>Sabra acknowledges this risk on their website, stating that while their hummus products are made with gluten-free ingredients, they cannot guarantee that the final product is entirely free from gluten due to the potential for cross-contamination. Therefore, if you have celiac disease or a severe gluten intolerance, you may want to exercise caution when consuming Sabra hummus.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

    <p>One way to ensure that a product is safe for those with gluten sensitivities is to look for gluten-free certification. Products that are certified gluten-free have undergone rigorous testing to ensure that they contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

    <p>As of now, Sabra hummus does not carry a gluten-free certification. This is likely due to the risk of cross-contamination in their manufacturing facilities. However, Sabra does offer a range of other products that are certified gluten-free, such as their guacamole and some of their dips.</p>
