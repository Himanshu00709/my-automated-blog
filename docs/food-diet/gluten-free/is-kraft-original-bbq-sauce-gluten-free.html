<h1>Is Kraft Original BBQ Sauce Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>When it comes to dietary restrictions, particularly gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding the ingredients in your favorite condiments is crucial. Kraft Original BBQ Sauce is a popular choice for many households, but is it safe for those who need to avoid gluten? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to determine whether Kraft Original BBQ Sauce is gluten-free.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it’s essential to scrutinize food labels and understand the potential sources of gluten in products.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Kraft Original BBQ Sauce</h2>

<p>To determine whether Kraft Original BBQ Sauce is gluten-free, let’s first examine its ingredients. According to the label, the primary ingredients include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>High fructose corn syrup</li>
    <li>Tomato paste</li>
    <li>Vinegar</li>
    <li>Molasses</li>
    <li>Modified food starch</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Spices</li>
    <li>Natural smoke flavor</li>
    <li>Caramel color</li>
    <li>Garlic powder</li>
    <li>Onion powder</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, none of these ingredients explicitly contain gluten. However, the term "modified food starch" can be a red flag for those avoiding gluten, as it can sometimes be derived from wheat. Let’s explore this further.</p>

<h2>Is Modified Food Starch Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Modified food starch is a common ingredient used as a thickening agent in many processed foods. It can be derived from various sources, including corn, potatoes, tapioca, and wheat. In the United States, if modified food starch is derived from wheat, it must be listed as "wheat starch" on the label due to FDA regulations. Since Kraft Original BBQ Sauce does not list wheat starch as an ingredient, it’s safe to assume that the modified food starch used is derived from a gluten-free source, such as corn.</p>

<h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination</h2>

<p>Even if the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can be a concern. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free products come into contact with gluten-containing products or surfaces during production. Kraft Foods has stated that they take precautions to prevent cross-contamination, but they do not guarantee that their products are entirely free from gluten due to the shared equipment used in their facilities.</p>

<p>For individuals with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease, this potential for cross-contamination might be a deal-breaker. However, for those with mild gluten sensitivity, the risk may be minimal.</p>

<h2>Certifications and Labeling</h2>

<p>Kraft Original BBQ Sauce does not carry a gluten-free certification from organizations such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO) or the Celiac Support Association (CSA). These certifications require rigorous testing and adherence to strict gluten-free standards, including limits on gluten content (typically less than 20 parts per million). The absence of such certification means that Kraft Original BBQ Sauce has not been independently verified as gluten-free.</p>
