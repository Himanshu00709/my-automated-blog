    <h1>Are Braum's Fries Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can be a challenge. One of the most common questions that arise is whether certain menu items, like fries, are gluten-free. Braum's, a popular fast-food chain known for its ice cream and burgers, is no exception. In this article, we will delve into whether Braum's fries are gluten-free, what ingredients are used, and how they are prepared. We will also provide tips for those who need to avoid gluten and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it's crucial for these individuals to know whether the foods they consume contain gluten.</p>

    <p>When it comes to fries, the primary concern is whether they are coated with any flour or cooked in shared fryers with gluten-containing foods. Cross-contamination is a significant issue for those who need to avoid gluten, as even trace amounts can cause a reaction.</p>

    <h2>Are Braum's Fries Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Braum's fries are made from fresh, hand-cut potatoes, which are naturally gluten-free. However, the preparation process is where things can get tricky. According to Braum's, their fries are cooked in dedicated fryers, which means they are not fried in the same oil as gluten-containing items like breaded chicken or onion rings. This significantly reduces the risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>Additionally, Braum's does not use any coatings or batters on their fries, which further ensures that they remain gluten-free. However, it's always a good idea to double-check with the staff at your local Braum's to confirm their current practices, as recipes and preparation methods can change.</p>
