<h1>Are BJ's Wings Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>When it comes to dining out, individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease often face challenges in finding safe and delicious options. BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is a popular chain known for its wide variety of menu items, including their famous wings. But are BJ's wings gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, preparation methods, and potential cross-contamination risks to help you make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it’s crucial for those affected to be vigilant about the foods they consume, especially when dining out.</p>

<h2>Are BJ's Wings Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse offers a variety of wing flavors, but not all of them are gluten-free. The primary concern lies in the sauces and seasonings used on the wings, as well as the potential for cross-contamination during preparation. Below, we’ll break down the gluten-free status of BJ's wings and provide tips for ordering safely.</p>

<h3>Gluten-Free Wing Flavors at BJ's</h3>

<p>According to BJ's official allergen menu, some of their wing flavors are considered gluten-free. These include:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Wing Flavor</th>
        <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Traditional Buffalo</td>
        <td>Gluten-Free</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sweet Heat BBQ</td>
        <td>Gluten-Free</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Lemon Pepper</td>
        <td>Gluten-Free</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>It’s important to note that while these flavors are gluten-free, cross-contamination can still occur in the kitchen. Always inform your server about your gluten intolerance or celiac disease to ensure proper precautions are taken.</p>

<h3>Non-Gluten-Free Wing Flavors</h3>

<p>Some of BJ's wing flavors contain gluten due to the ingredients used in their sauces or seasonings. These include:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Wing Flavor</th>
        <th>Gluten-Containing Ingredients</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Spicy Garlic</td>
        <td>Wheat-based soy sauce</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Teriyaki</td>
        <td>Wheat-based soy sauce</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Honey Sriracha</td>
        <td>Wheat-based thickeners</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>If you’re avoiding gluten, it’s best to steer clear of these flavors to prevent any adverse reactions.</p>

<h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

<p>Even if a wing flavor is labeled as gluten-free, cross-contamination can still pose a risk. This can occur when gluten-free items come into contact with surfaces, utensils, or fryers that have been used to prepare gluten-containing foods. BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse does not have a dedicated gluten-free fryer, which means that their wings are typically fried in the same oil as other gluten-containing items.</p>

<p>To minimize the risk of cross-contamination, consider the following tips:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Inform your server about your gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</li>
    <li>Ask if the kitchen can prepare your wings separately to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
    <li>Consider ordering your wings grilled instead of fried, if available.</li>
</ul>
