    <h1>Is Kraft Parmesan Cheese Gluten-Free?</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, understanding whether a product is gluten-free is crucial. Kraft Parmesan Cheese is a popular ingredient in many households, but is it safe for those who need to avoid gluten? In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free status of Kraft Parmesan Cheese, its ingredients, and what you need to know to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it’s essential to carefully examine the ingredients of any food product, including cheese, to ensure it’s gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Kraft Parmesan Cheese</h2>

    <p>Kraft Parmesan Cheese is a grated cheese product that is widely used in various dishes, from pasta to salads. To determine whether it’s gluten-free, let’s take a closer look at its ingredients:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Source</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Parmesan Cheese</td>
                <td>Milk, Cheese Cultures, Salt, Enzymes</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cellulose Powder</td>
                <td>Plant-Based</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Potassium Sorbate</td>
                <td>Preservative</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cheese Culture</td>
                <td>Microbial</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As seen in the table above, the primary ingredients in Kraft Parmesan Cheese are gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that Kraft does not label this product as "gluten-free" on its packaging. This is likely due to the potential for cross-contamination during manufacturing, which we’ll discuss in the next section.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Concerns</h2>

    <p>Even if a product’s ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. This happens when gluten-free products come into contact with gluten-containing products or surfaces. Kraft has stated that they take precautions to prevent cross-contamination, but they do not guarantee that their Parmesan Cheese is entirely free from gluten traces.</p>

    <p>For individuals with severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, even trace amounts of gluten can cause adverse reactions. Therefore, it’s essential to consider the risk of cross-contamination when deciding whether to consume Kraft Parmesan Cheese.</p>

    <h2>Kraft’s Stance on Gluten-Free Labeling</h2>

    <p>Kraft Foods has a comprehensive approach to allergen labeling. They clearly list all major allergens, including wheat, on their product labels. However, they do not specifically label their Parmesan Cheese as "gluten-free." This is because the product may be processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing ingredients, increasing the risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>If you’re highly sensitive to gluten, it’s advisable to look for products that are certified gluten-free by a recognized organization, such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). These products undergo rigorous testing to ensure they meet strict gluten-free standards.</p>
