    <h1>Is Seaweed Salad Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Seaweed salad has become a popular dish in many cuisines, especially in Japanese and Korean restaurants. Known for its unique texture, vibrant color, and nutritional benefits, seaweed salad is often considered a healthy choice. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Is seaweed salad gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we will explore the ingredients typically used in seaweed salad, potential sources of gluten, and how to ensure your seaweed salad is safe to eat.</p>

    <h2>What is Seaweed Salad?</h2>

    <p>Seaweed salad is a dish made primarily from various types of edible seaweed, such as wakame, nori, or hijiki.

The salad is known for its refreshing taste and is often served as a side dish or appetizer in Japanese and Korean cuisine.</p>

    <h2>Is Seaweed Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>
