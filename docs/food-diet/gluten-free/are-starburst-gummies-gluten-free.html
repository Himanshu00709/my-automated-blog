    <h1>Are Starburst Gummies Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>
    <p>Starburst gummies are a popular treat enjoyed by many, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether these chewy candies are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to determine if Starburst gummies are safe for a gluten-free diet. We’ll also address common questions and provide a comprehensive conclusion to help you make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s essential to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and production processes of any food product, including candies like Starburst gummies.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Starburst Gummies</h2>
    <p>To determine if Starburst gummies are gluten-free, let’s first examine their ingredients. The primary ingredients in Starburst gummies include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Corn syrup</li>
        <li>Modified corn starch</li>
        <li>Fruit juice from concentrate</li>
        <li>Citric acid</li>
        <li>Natural and artificial flavors</li>
        <li>Color additives</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it’s important to consider potential cross-contamination during manufacturing, which we’ll discuss in the next section.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>
    <p>Even if a product’s ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can pose a risk. This occurs when gluten-free products come into contact with gluten-containing products or surfaces during production. Starburst gummies are manufactured in facilities that may also process gluten-containing products, which raises concerns about cross-contamination.</p>
    <p>However, Starburst has stated that they take precautions to minimize cross-contamination. They clean their equipment thoroughly between production runs and follow strict protocols to ensure the safety of their products. Despite these measures, the risk of cross-contamination cannot be entirely eliminated.</p>

    <h2>Certifications and Labeling</h2>
    <p>One way to ensure a product is gluten-free is to look for certifications from recognized organizations. Starburst gummies do not currently carry a gluten-free certification from organizations like the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). However, the absence of certification does not necessarily mean the product contains gluten. It simply means that the product has not undergone the rigorous testing required for certification.</p>
    <p>Starburst gummies are labeled as “gluten-free” on their packaging in some regions, which indicates that the manufacturer believes the product meets the FDA’s gluten-free standards. The FDA requires that products labeled as gluten-free contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Comparison of Starburst Gummies with Other Gluten-Free Candies</h2>
    <p>To provide a clearer picture, let’s compare Starburst gummies with other popular gluten-free candies:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Candy</th>

                <th>Risk of Cross-Contamination</th>
            </tr>

                <td>Low</td>

                <td>Moderate</td>
            </tr>
