<h1>Are Gorditas Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Gorditas, a beloved staple in Mexican cuisine, are thick, soft tortillas often stuffed with a variety of fillings like beans, cheese, meats, and vegetables. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Are gorditas gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients, preparation methods, and alternatives to help you enjoy gorditas without compromising your health.</p>

<h2>What Are Gorditas Made Of?</h2>

<p>Traditional gorditas are made from masa harina, a type of corn flour that is naturally gluten-free. Masa harina is derived from corn that has been treated with lime (calcium hydroxide) in a process called nixtamalization. This process not only enhances the nutritional value of the corn but also gives masa harina its distinctive flavor and texture.</p>

<p>However, not all gorditas are created equal. Some recipes or commercial versions may include wheat flour or other gluten-containing ingredients, especially in the fillings or toppings. Therefore, it’s crucial to examine the ingredients and preparation methods carefully.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Ingredients in Gorditas</h2>

<p>To ensure that gorditas are gluten-free, it’s essential to focus on the ingredients used in both the dough and the fillings. Below is a table summarizing common ingredients in gorditas and their gluten status:</p>
