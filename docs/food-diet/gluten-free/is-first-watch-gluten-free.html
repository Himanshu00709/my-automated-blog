<h1>Is First Watch Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>First Watch is a popular breakfast, brunch, and lunch restaurant chain known for its fresh, made-to-order dishes. With a growing number of people adopting gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, it's essential to know whether First Watch can accommodate these dietary needs. In this article, we'll explore the gluten-free options at First Watch, how the restaurant handles cross-contamination, and provide tips for dining safely.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including damage to the small intestine. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, ingesting gluten can cause discomfort and other symptoms. Therefore, it's crucial for those on a gluten-free diet to be vigilant about the foods they consume, especially when dining out.</p>

<h2>First Watch's Gluten-Free Menu Options</h2>

<p>First Watch offers a variety of gluten-free options, making it a relatively safe choice for those avoiding gluten. However, it's important to note that while the restaurant provides gluten-free dishes, cross-contamination can still occur in the kitchen. Here are some of the gluten-free options available at First Watch:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Category</th>
            <th>Gluten-Free Options</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Breakfast</td>
            <td>Eggs, bacon, sausage, avocado toast (with gluten-free bread), fresh fruit, and yogurt</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Lunch</td>
            <td>Salads (without croutons), grilled chicken, and certain soups (ask for gluten-free options)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sides</td>
            <td>Fresh fruit, cottage cheese, and certain vegetables</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Beverages</td>
            <td>Coffee, tea, and fresh juices</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
