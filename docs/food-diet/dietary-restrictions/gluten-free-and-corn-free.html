    <h1>Gluten-Free and Corn-Free Living: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free and corn-free diets has surged, driven by both medical necessity and personal preference. Whether you're managing celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or corn allergies, or simply exploring a healthier lifestyle, understanding how to navigate these dietary restrictions is essential. This guide will provide you with a detailed overview of gluten-free and corn-free living, including food options, health benefits, and practical tips for maintaining a balanced diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Corn</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It acts as a binding agent, giving elasticity to dough and helping it rise. Corn, on the other hand, is a staple grain that is widely used in various forms, including cornmeal, cornstarch, and high-fructose corn syrup. While both gluten and corn are common in many diets, they can cause adverse reactions in certain individuals.</p>

    <h3>Why Go Gluten-Free and Corn-Free?</h3>
    <p>For some, avoiding gluten and corn is a medical necessity. Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder, requires a strict gluten-free diet to prevent damage to the small intestine. Similarly, corn allergies or intolerances can cause symptoms ranging from digestive issues to skin rashes. Others may choose to eliminate these ingredients to reduce inflammation, improve digestion, or support overall health.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free and Corn-Free Foods</h2>
    <p>Adopting a gluten-free and corn-free diet doesn't mean sacrificing flavor or variety. There are plenty of delicious and nutritious options available. Below is a table of common gluten-free and corn-free foods:</p>
