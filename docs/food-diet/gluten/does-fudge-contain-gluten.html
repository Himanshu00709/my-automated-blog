<p>As you can see, most of the basic ingredients in fudge are naturally gluten-free. However, there are some potential sources of gluten that you need to be aware of, especially if you are highly sensitive or have celiac disease.</p>

<h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Fudge</h2>

<p>While the primary ingredients in fudge are gluten-free, there are a few ways that gluten can sneak into this treat:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Flavorings and Add-Ins:</strong> Some flavorings, such as certain types of chocolate or extracts, may contain gluten. Additionally, add-ins like cookies, pretzels, or certain types of candy can introduce gluten into the fudge.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If fudge is made in a facility that also processes gluten-containing products, there is a risk of cross-contamination. This is particularly important for those with celiac disease, as even trace amounts of gluten can cause a reaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Thickeners and Stabilizers:</strong> Some fudge recipes may include thickeners or stabilizers that contain gluten. Always check the labels of any pre-packaged ingredients you use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Ensure Your Fudge is Gluten-Free</h2>

<p>If you are making fudge at home or purchasing it from a store, there are several steps you can take to ensure that it is gluten-free:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Read Labels Carefully:</strong> When purchasing ingredients, always read the labels to check for any gluten-containing additives or cross-contamination warnings.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Certified Gluten-Free Ingredients:</strong> Opt for ingredients that are certified gluten-free, especially when it comes to chocolate, extracts, and add-ins.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid Cross-Contamination:</strong> If you are making fudge at home, ensure that all utensils, pans, and surfaces are thoroughly cleaned to avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing foods.</li>
    <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> When purchasing fudge from a bakery or store, don't hesitate to ask about the ingredients and preparation process to ensure that it is safe for you to eat.</li>
</ol>
