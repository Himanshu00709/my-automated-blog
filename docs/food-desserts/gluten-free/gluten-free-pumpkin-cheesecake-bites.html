    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a medium-sized bowl, combine the crushed gluten-free graham crackers with the melted butter. Mix until the crumbs are evenly coated. Press the mixture into the bottom of a mini muffin tin, forming a firm crust. Bake the crust for about 5 minutes, then remove from the oven and let it cool.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Cheesecake Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until it's smooth and creamy. Add the pumpkin puree, granulated sugar, vanilla extract, and pumpkin pie spice. Continue to beat the mixture until all the ingredients are well combined and the filling is smooth.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Once the crust has cooled, spoon the cheesecake filling over each crust in the mini muffin tin. Fill each cavity almost to the top. Bake the cheesecake bites for about 15-20 minutes, or until the filling is set. Allow the bites to cool completely before removing them from the tin.</p>

    <h3>4. Add the Finishing Touches</h3>
    <p>Once the cheesecake bites have cooled, you can add a dollop of whipped cream on top of each bite for an extra touch of indulgence. If you prefer, you can also sprinkle a little extra pumpkin pie spice on top for added flavor and decoration.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these cheesecake bites ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can! These gluten-free pumpkin cheesecake bites can be made a day in advance. Simply store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve. They also freeze well, so you can make a larger batch and save some for later.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of crust?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer a different type of crust, you can use gluten-free cookies, nuts, or even a mixture of oats and butter. Just make sure to press the crust firmly into the muffin tin to ensure it holds together.</p>

        <h3>Are these cheesecake bites suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This particular recipe is not vegan, as it contains cream cheese and butter. However, you can easily adapt it by using vegan cream cheese and a plant-based butter substitute. Be sure to check that all your ingredients are vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin puree?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh pumpkin puree if you prefer. Simply roast a small pumpkin, remove the flesh, and blend it until smooth. Make sure to drain any excess liquid to achieve the right consistency for the cheesecake filling.</p>
