    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Cheesecake Bars</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free cheesecake bars:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of almond flour with 1/2 cup of melted unsalted butter. Mix until the ingredients are well combined and the mixture resembles wet sand. Press this mixture firmly into the bottom of a parchment-lined baking dish to form the crust. Bake for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and let it cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Cheesecake Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat 24 oz of cream cheese until it’s smooth and creamy. Gradually add 1 cup of sugar, mixing until fully incorporated. Add 3 large eggs, one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully mixed before adding the next. Finally, stir in 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tbsp of lemon juice. Mix until the filling is smooth and well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the cheesecake filling over the cooled crust, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle. Remove from the oven and let it cool to room temperature before transferring to the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours, or overnight.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the cheesecake bars are fully chilled, remove them from the baking dish and cut into squares. Serve with your favorite toppings, such as fresh berries, whipped cream, or a drizzle of chocolate sauce.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cheesecake Bars</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different type of flour for the crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours such as oat flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. However, keep in mind that different flours may alter the texture and flavor of the crust.</p>

        <h3>2. How long do gluten-free cheesecake bars last?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cheesecake bars can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Make sure to keep them in an airtight container to maintain freshness.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I freeze gluten-free cheesecake bars?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze them for up to 2 months. Wrap individual bars in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe container. Thaw in the refrigerator before serving.</p>

        <h3>4. Are gluten-free cheesecake bars healthier than regular cheesecake?</h3>
        <p>While gluten-free cheesecake bars eliminate gluten, they still contain sugar and dairy, which should be consumed in moderation. However, using almond flour for the crust adds healthy fats and protein, making it a slightly healthier option.</p>
