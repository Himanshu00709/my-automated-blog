    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Ding Dong Cake</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free Ding Dong cake is a fun and rewarding process. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create this delicious dessert:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cake Batter</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and greasing your cake pans. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, butter (or oil), and milk. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Cream Filling</h3>
    <p>While the cake cools, prepare the cream filling. In a mixing bowl, beat together softened butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy. If desired, add a splash of milk to achieve a smoother consistency. Once the cake has cooled, spread the cream filling evenly over one layer of the cake, then place the second layer on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Chocolate Glaze</h3>
    <p>For the glaze, melt chocolate and cream together in a double boiler or microwave, stirring until smooth. Allow the glaze to cool slightly, then pour it over the assembled cake, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Let the glaze set before slicing and serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free Ding Dong cake turns out perfectly, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend for the best texture.</li>
        <li>Don't overmix the batter, as this can lead to a dense cake.</li>
        <li>Allow the cake to cool completely before adding the filling and glaze.</li>
        <li>Store the cake in an airtight container to keep it fresh.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Ding Dong Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Simply substitute the butter and milk with dairy-free alternatives like coconut oil and almond milk. Ensure the chocolate used in the glaze is also dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best?</h3>
        <p>A blend of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch is a great option. Many pre-made gluten-free flour blends are also available at grocery stores.</p>

        <h3>How long does the cake stay fresh?</h3>
        <p>When stored in an airtight container, the cake can last up to 3 days at room temperature or up to a week in the refrigerator.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cake for up to 2 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer-safe container.</p>
