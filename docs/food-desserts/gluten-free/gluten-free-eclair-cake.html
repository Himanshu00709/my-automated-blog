    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free eclair cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Pudding:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the instant vanilla pudding mix and milk until thickened. Add the softened cream cheese and mix until smooth. Fold in the whipped topping until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer the Cake:</strong> In a 9x13 inch baking dish, place a single layer of gluten-free graham crackers or cookies. Spread half of the pudding mixture over the crackers. Add another layer of crackers and top with the remaining pudding mixture. Finish with a final layer of crackers.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Chocolate Glaze:</strong> In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate chips and butter. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Stir in the vanilla extract if using.</li>
        <li><strong>Top the Cake:</strong> Pour the chocolate glaze over the top layer of crackers, spreading it evenly to cover the entire surface. Refrigerate the cake for at least 4 hours, or overnight, to allow the layers to set.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Once the cake has set, slice it into squares and serve. Store any leftovers in the refrigerator.</li>
