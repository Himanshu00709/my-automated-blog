    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Crust</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Crush the gluten-free graham crackers or cookies into fine crumbs using a food processor or by placing them in a zip-top bag and rolling them with a rolling pin. Mix the crumbs with melted unsalted butter until the mixture resembles wet sand. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie dish. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then let it cool completely before adding the mousse.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Chocolate Mousse</h3>

    <p>In a heatproof bowl, melt the dark chocolate over a double boiler or in the microwave, stirring until smooth. Let the chocolate cool slightly. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. In another bowl, beat the egg yolks with sugar until pale and fluffy. Gently fold the melted chocolate into the egg yolk mixture, then fold in the whipped cream until fully incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, as this can deflate the mousse.</p>

    <h3>3. Assembling the Pie</h3>

    <p>Pour the chocolate mousse into the cooled crust, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Refrigerate the pie for at least 4 hours, or until the mousse is set. For an extra touch of elegance, you can garnish the pie with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, or fresh berries before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free chocolate mousse pie turns out perfectly:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use high-quality chocolate:</strong> The flavor of your mousse will depend largely on the quality of the chocolate you use. Opt for a dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa content for a rich, intense flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill your mixing bowls:</strong> For the best results, chill your mixing bowls and beaters in the freezer for 10-15 minutes before whipping the cream. This will help the cream whip up faster and hold its shape better.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the mousse:</strong> When folding the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture, be gentle to maintain the light, airy texture of the mousse.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the pie set properly:</strong> Allow the pie to chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight if possible. This will ensure that the mousse is fully set and slices cleanly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this pie dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this pie dairy-free by substituting the heavy cream with a non-dairy alternative like coconut cream and using dairy-free chocolate. Be sure to also use a dairy-free butter substitute for the crust.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How long can I store the pie?</h3>
