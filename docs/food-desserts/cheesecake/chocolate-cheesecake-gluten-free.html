    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Chocolate Cheesecake</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing the Crust</h3>
    <p>The crust is the foundation of any cheesecake. For a gluten-free version, start by crushing gluten-free graham crackers or using almond flour. Mix the crumbs with melted butter and a touch of sugar, then press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a springform pan. Bake the crust for about 10 minutes to set it before adding the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Chocolate Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add sugar, cocoa powder, and heavy cream, mixing until well combined. Add eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next. The key to a smooth filling is to avoid overmixing, which can introduce air bubbles and cause cracks during baking.</p>

    <h3>3. Baking the Cheesecake</h3>
    <p>Pour the filling over the pre-baked crust and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake the cheesecake in a water bath to ensure even cooking and prevent cracking. The water bath creates a humid environment, which helps the cheesecake bake gently and evenly. Bake at 325°F (160°C) for about 50-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still jiggles slightly.</p>

    <h3>4. Cooling and Chilling</h3>
    <p>Once baked, turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool inside with the door slightly ajar. This gradual cooling process prevents sudden temperature changes that can cause cracks. After cooling, refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow it to set completely.</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular graham crackers for the crust?</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="faq">

    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>4. How long does gluten-free chocolate cheesecake last?</h3>
