<h1>Gluten-Free Cheesecake Sampler: A Delightful Journey</h1>

<p>Cheesecake is a timeless dessert that has been enjoyed for centuries. Its creamy texture and rich flavor make it a favorite among dessert lovers.

<h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>

<ol>

    <li><strong>Add Flavors:</strong> Divide the filling into separate bowls and add different flavorings to each (e.g., lemon zest, cocoa powder, or fruit puree).</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the filling into the prepared crusts and bake at 325°F (160°C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center is still slightly jiggly.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and Top:</strong> Allow the cheesecakes to cool completely before adding your desired toppings. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
