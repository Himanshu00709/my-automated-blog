Made without gluten-containing ingredients like wheat, barley, or rye, this dessert is perfect for those who need or choose to avoid gluten. The base of a gluten-free cookie cake typically includes gluten-free flour blends, such as almond flour, coconut flour, or a mix of rice and tapioca flour, which provide the structure and texture needed to mimic traditional cookies.</p>
