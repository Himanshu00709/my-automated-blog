    <h1>Gluten-Free Rainbow Cake: A Colorful Delight</h1>
    <p>Rainbow cakes are a feast for the eyes and the taste buds, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a traditional rainbow cake can be a challenge.

Each layer represents a different color of the rainbow, creating a stunning visual effect when the cake is sliced. The key difference between a traditional rainbow cake and a gluten-free version is the use of gluten-free flour, which ensures that the cake is safe for those with gluten intolerances or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>How to Make a Gluten-Free Rainbow Cake</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free rainbow cake is a fun and rewarding process. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create your own masterpiece:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Divide and Color the Batter</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter evenly into six separate bowls. Add a few drops of food coloring to each bowl, mixing until you achieve the desired color. The colors should correspond to the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Layers</h3>
    <p>Pour each colored batter into a greased and lined 8-inch round cake pan. Bake each layer for 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the layers to cool completely before removing them from the pans.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Cake</h3>
    <p>Once the layers are cool, it’s time to assemble the cake. Place the first layer on a cake stand or plate and spread a thin layer of frosting on top. Repeat with the remaining layers, stacking them in the order of the rainbow. Frost the entire cake with a generous layer of frosting, and decorate as desired.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Rainbow Cake</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free rainbow cake turns out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking cakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use gel food coloring:</strong> Gel food coloring is more concentrated than liquid, so you’ll need less of it to achieve vibrant colors.</li>
        <li><strong>Allow the layers to cool completely:</strong> Assembling the cake with warm layers can cause the frosting to melt and slide off.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Rainbow Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make a gluten-free rainbow cake without eggs?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a gluten-free rainbow cake without eggs by using egg substitutes such as flax eggs, applesauce, or commercial egg replacers. Keep in mind that the texture may vary slightly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use natural food coloring?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Natural food coloring made from fruits and vegetables can be used to achieve the rainbow effect. However, the colors may not be as vibrant as those achieved with synthetic food coloring.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I store a gluten-free rainbow cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. If the cake is frosted with a dairy-based frosting, refrigeration is recommended.</p>
    </div>
