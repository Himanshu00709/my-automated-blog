    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and make cleanup a breeze.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set this aside for later.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Cream Cheese</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter and cream cheese together until smooth and creamy. Add the granulated sugar and continue to beat until the mixture is light and fluffy.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined. Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure everything is evenly mixed.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to tough cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in Strawberries and Chocolate Chips</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the crushed freeze-dried strawberries and white chocolate chips. The strawberries will add a burst of fruity flavor, while the chocolate chips will provide a creamy contrast.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your gluten-free strawberry cheesecake cookies with a glass of milk or a cup of tea!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Cookies</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Make sure your butter, cream cheese, and egg are at room temperature before you start. This will help them mix together more smoothly.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too soft, you can chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before baking. This will help the cookies hold their shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to get creative with your add-ins. You can try using different types of freeze-dried fruit or even swap out the white chocolate chips for dark chocolate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh strawberries instead of freeze-dried?</h3>
        <p>While you can use fresh strawberries, they will add moisture to the dough, which can affect the texture of the cookies. Freeze-dried strawberries are recommended because they provide concentrated flavor without adding extra moisture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these cookies dairy-free by using dairy-free butter and cream cheese alternatives. Just make sure to check the labels to ensure they are gluten-free as well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 2 months. Just thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend you prefer. Just make sure it's a 1:1 substitute for all-purpose flour. Some blends may have a slightly different texture, so you may need to adjust the baking time accordingly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="conclusion">
