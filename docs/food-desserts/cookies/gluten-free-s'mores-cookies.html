    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free s'mores cookies. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure your cookies turn out perfectly every time.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you're ready to bake the cookies, which is crucial for achieving the perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer. Next, add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a smooth dough forms.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Mix-Ins</h3>

    <p>Once your dough is ready, it's time to add the mix-ins that will give your cookies that classic s'mores flavor. Fold in the mini marshmallows, chocolate chips, and crushed gluten-free graham crackers. Be gentle when mixing to avoid crushing the marshmallows too much.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Scoop and Bake</h3>

    <p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. This allows the cookies to spread evenly as they bake. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are set. Keep an eye on the cookies, as the marshmallows can cause them to brown quickly.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once the cookies are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. This helps the cookies set and prevents them from falling apart. Once cooled, enjoy your gluten-free s'mores cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite hot beverage!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free S'mores Cookies</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the cookies to be gluten-free. However, if you're catering to someone with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, it's important to stick with a gluten-free flour blend.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before baking. This can actually enhance the flavor as the ingredients have more time to meld together.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free s'mores cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. If you want to keep them longer, you can freeze the baked cookies for up to 2 months. Just make sure to thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use different types of chocolate?</h3>
        <p>Yes, feel free to experiment with different types of chocolate, such as milk chocolate, white chocolate, or even dark chocolate. You can also use chocolate chunks instead of chips for a more decadent texture.</p>
