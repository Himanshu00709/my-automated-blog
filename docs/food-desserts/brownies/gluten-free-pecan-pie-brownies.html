    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free pecan pie brownies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you’re ready to bake the brownies.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Brownie Batter</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, melt the butter and then mix in the granulated sugar. Add the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Pecan Pie Topping</h3>
    <p>In a small saucepan, combine the brown sugar, corn syrup, and a pinch of salt. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugar has dissolved. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the chopped pecans.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the brownie batter into a greased 9x9 inch baking pan, spreading it evenly. Next, pour the pecan pie topping over the brownie batter, spreading it out to cover the entire surface. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan before cutting them into squares. This will ensure that the pecan pie topping sets properly. Serve and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of nut?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute pecans with other nuts like walnuts or almonds if you prefer. However, pecans are traditional in pecan pie and provide a unique flavor and texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these brownies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine. Just make sure to use a dairy-free chocolate if you’re adding any chocolate chips.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these brownies?</h3>
        <p>Store the brownies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate them for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. Just make sure it’s a 1:1 substitute for all-purpose flour to ensure the right texture.</p>
    </div>
