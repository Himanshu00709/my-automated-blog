    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free pecan pie brownies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease an 8x8 inch baking pan and line it with parchment paper, leaving some overhang on the sides for easy removal later.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Brownie Batter</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, melt the butter and whisk in the granulated sugar until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Pecan Topping</h3>
    <p>In a small saucepan, combine the brown sugar, corn syrup (or maple syrup), and a pinch of salt. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is smooth. Remove from heat and stir in the chopped pecans.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the brownie batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly. Spoon the pecan mixture over the top, spreading it out as evenly as possible. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Be careful not to overbake, as the brownies will continue to set as they cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan before lifting them out using the parchment paper overhang. Cut into squares and serve. Enjoy your gluten-free pecan pie brownies with a glass of milk or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra treat!</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free pecan pie brownies are not only delicious but also offer some nutritional benefits. Pecans are a great source of healthy fats, fiber, and essential vitamins and minerals like magnesium and zinc. Using gluten-free flour can also make this dessert easier to digest for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Additionally, by using natural sweeteners like maple syrup, you can reduce the overall sugar content while still enjoying a sweet treat.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of nut?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute pecans with other nuts like walnuts or almonds if you prefer. However, pecans have a unique flavor and texture that pairs particularly well with the chocolatey brownie base.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these brownies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or a plant-based butter. Make sure to check that all other ingredients are also dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these brownies?</h3>
        <p>Store the brownies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can keep them in the refrigerator for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. Just make sure it's a 1:1 substitute for regular flour to ensure the right texture.</p>

Whether you're gluten-free by necessity or choice, this recipe is a fantastic way to enjoy a classic dessert without compromising on flavor or texture.
