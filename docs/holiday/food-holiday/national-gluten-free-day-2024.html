    <h1>National Gluten-Free Day 2024: A Celebration of Health and Awareness</h1>
    <p>Every year on January 11th, National Gluten-Free Day is celebrated to raise awareness about gluten-related disorders and to promote the benefits of a gluten-free lifestyle. As we approach 2024, this day holds even more significance as the gluten-free movement continues to grow, with more people recognizing the importance of dietary choices for their health and well-being. Whether you're living with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply exploring gluten-free options, this day is a perfect opportunity to learn, share, and celebrate.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale.

    <p>Going gluten-free is not just a trend; for many, it's a medical necessity. However, even for those without gluten-related disorders, a gluten-free diet can offer benefits such as improved digestion, increased energy levels, and better overall health.
