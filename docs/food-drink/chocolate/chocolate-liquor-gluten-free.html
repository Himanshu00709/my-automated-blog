<h1>Is Chocolate Liquor Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Chocolate liquor, despite its name, is not an alcoholic beverage. It is a key ingredient in chocolate production, made by grinding cocoa beans into a smooth, liquid form. For individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, understanding whether chocolate liquor is gluten-free is crucial. This article delves into the details of chocolate liquor, its gluten-free status, and what you need to know to make informed dietary choices.</p>

<h2>What is Chocolate Liquor?</h2>

<p>Chocolate liquor, also known as cocoa liquor, is the purest form of chocolate. It is produced by grinding cocoa beans into a liquid state, which contains both cocoa solids and cocoa butter. This liquid is then used as the base for making various chocolate products, including dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate. Despite its name, chocolate liquor contains no alcohol and is not related to alcoholic beverages.</p>

<h2>Is Chocolate Liquor Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Yes, chocolate liquor is naturally gluten-free. Cocoa beans, the primary ingredient in chocolate liquor, do not contain gluten.
