    <h1>Gluten-Free Ice Cream: A Guide to the Best Places</h1>
    <p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding delicious and safe treats can be a challenge. Ice cream, a beloved dessert, often contains hidden gluten in the form of additives, mix-ins, or cross-contamination. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free awareness has led to an increasing number of ice cream shops offering gluten-free options. In this guide, we’ll explore some of the best gluten-free ice cream places, what to look for when choosing a safe option, and tips for enjoying your favorite frozen treat without worry.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Ice Cream Matters</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Even trace amounts of gluten can trigger symptoms, making it crucial to choose ice cream that is certified gluten-free or made in a dedicated gluten-free facility.</p>
    <p>Many traditional ice cream brands and shops use gluten-containing ingredients like cookie dough, brownie chunks, or waffle cones. Cross-contamination can also occur during production or serving. Therefore, it’s essential to seek out places that prioritize gluten-free options and follow strict protocols to ensure safety.</p>
