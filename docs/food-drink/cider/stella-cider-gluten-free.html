    <h1>Stella Cider Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Stella Cider has become a popular choice among cider enthusiasts, especially those who are gluten-intolerant or simply prefer a gluten-free lifestyle. This refreshing beverage offers a crisp, fruity flavor that appeals to a wide range of palates. In this article, we will delve into the details of Stella Cider, its gluten-free status, nutritional information, and why it has become a favorite among cider lovers.</p>

    <h2>What is Stella Cider?</h2>

    <p>Stella Cider is a premium alcoholic beverage produced by Stella Artois, a brand renowned for its high-quality beers. Unlike traditional beers, Stella Cider is made from fermented apples, giving it a distinctively sweet and tangy flavor profile. It is a popular choice for those who enjoy a lighter, fruitier alternative to beer.</p>

    <p>One of the key selling points of Stella Cider is its gluten-free nature. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding a safe and enjoyable alcoholic beverage can be challenging. Stella Cider provides a delicious option that doesn't compromise on taste or quality.</p>

    <h2>Is Stella Cider Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, Stella Cider is gluten-free. Unlike beer, which is typically made from barley, wheat, or rye—all of which contain gluten—cider is made from apples. The fermentation process of apples does not involve gluten-containing grains, making cider a naturally gluten-free beverage.</p>

    <p>However, it's important to note that not all ciders are created equal. Some ciders may be produced in facilities that also process gluten-containing products, leading to potential cross-contamination. Stella Cider, on the other hand, is produced in a controlled environment to ensure that it remains gluten-free. This makes it a safe choice for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>
