<h1>Gluten-Free Cocktails: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and the world of cocktails is no exception. Whether you're celiac, gluten-sensitive, or simply choosing to avoid gluten for health reasons, there's no need to miss out on the joy of a well-crafted cocktail. This guide will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free cocktails, from understanding what makes a cocktail gluten-free to recipes you can try at home.</p>

<h2>What Makes a Cocktail Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>At its core, a gluten-free cocktail is one that contains no ingredients derived from gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, or rye. This includes the base spirits, mixers, and any additional flavorings or garnishes. However, the process of distillation typically removes gluten proteins from spirits, making many distilled beverages inherently gluten-free. But it's essential to be cautious, as some products may still contain gluten due to additives or cross-contamination during production.</p>

<h2>Popular Gluten-Free Spirits</h2>

<p>When crafting a gluten-free cocktail, the choice of spirit is crucial. Here are some popular gluten-free spirits that you can confidently use:</p>
