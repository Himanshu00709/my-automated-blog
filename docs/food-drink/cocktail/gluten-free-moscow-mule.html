    <h1>Gluten-Free Moscow Mule: A Refreshing Twist on a Classic Cocktail</h1>

    <p>The Moscow Mule is a timeless cocktail that has been enjoyed by many for decades. Its refreshing blend of vodka, ginger beer, and lime juice served in a copper mug has made it a favorite at bars and parties worldwide. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying this classic drink can be a challenge due to the potential presence of gluten in certain ingredients. Enter the <strong>Gluten-Free Moscow Mule</strong>—a delicious and safe alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this iconic cocktail without compromising their dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Moscow Mule Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Traditionally, the Moscow Mule is made with three key ingredients: vodka, ginger beer, and lime juice. While vodka is typically gluten-free (as it is distilled from grains like wheat, rye, or barley, which removes gluten proteins), some brands may still contain trace amounts of gluten. Ginger beer, on the other hand, can be a bit more problematic. Many commercial ginger beers contain gluten as a result of the brewing process or added flavorings. Therefore, to create a truly gluten-free Moscow Mule, it's essential to choose your ingredients carefully.</p>
