    <h1>Gluten-Free Moscow Mule: A Refreshing Twist on a Classic Cocktail</h1>
    <p>The Moscow Mule is a timeless cocktail that has been enjoyed by many for decades. Its refreshing combination of vodka, ginger beer, and lime juice makes it a favorite at parties, bars, and casual gatherings. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a traditional Moscow Mule can be a challenge due to the gluten content in some ginger beers and vodkas. Enter the gluten-free Moscow Mule—a delicious and safe alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this classic drink without worry.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Moscow Mule Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>To create a gluten-free Moscow Mule, it’s essential to ensure that all the ingredients used are free from gluten. This includes the vodka, ginger beer, and any additional flavorings or garnishes. While vodka is typically distilled from grains like wheat, rye, or barley, the distillation process removes gluten proteins, making most vodkas inherently gluten-free. However, some individuals with severe gluten sensitivities may prefer vodkas made from gluten-free sources like potatoes or grapes.</p>
    <p>Ginger beer, on the other hand, can be a bit trickier. Many commercial ginger beers contain gluten or are processed in facilities that handle gluten-containing ingredients. Therefore, it’s crucial to choose a ginger beer that is certified gluten-free. Fortunately, there are several brands available that cater to gluten-free diets, ensuring that your Moscow Mule is both safe and delicious.</p>
