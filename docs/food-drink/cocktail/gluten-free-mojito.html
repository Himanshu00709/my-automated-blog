    <h1>Gluten-Free Mojito: A Refreshing Twist on a Classic Cocktail</h1>

    <p>The mojito, a classic cocktail that originated in Cuba, has long been a favorite for its refreshing blend of mint, lime, sugar, and rum. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a traditional mojito can be a bit of a gamble due to the potential for gluten contamination in certain ingredients. Enter the gluten-free mojito—a delicious and safe alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this timeless drink without worry. In this article, we’ll explore the origins of the mojito, how to make a gluten-free version, and why it’s a great choice for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>The Origins of the Mojito</h2>

    <p>The mojito has a rich history that dates back to the 16th century. It is believed to have been invented in Cuba, where it was originally known as "El Draque" after Sir Francis Drake, who was said to have created a similar drink to ward off scurvy among his crew. Over time, the drink evolved into the mojito we know today, with its signature combination of fresh mint, lime juice, sugar, white rum, and soda water. The mojito gained international popularity in the 20th century and has since become a staple in bars and restaurants around the world.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause serious health issues for people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Even trace amounts of gluten can trigger symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue in those who are sensitive. While the traditional mojito is naturally gluten-free, certain ingredients, such as flavored rums or pre-made mixes, may contain gluten. Therefore, it’s essential to choose your ingredients carefully when making a gluten-free mojito.</p>

    <h2>How to Make a Gluten-Free Mojito</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free mojito is simple and requires just a few key ingredients. Here’s a step-by-step guide to crafting the perfect gluten-free mojito:</p>
