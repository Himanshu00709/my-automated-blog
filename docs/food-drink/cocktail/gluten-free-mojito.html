    <h1>Gluten-Free Mojito: A Refreshing Twist on a Classic Cocktail</h1>

    <p>The mojito, a classic Cuban cocktail, has been a favorite among cocktail enthusiasts for decades. Its refreshing blend of mint, lime, sugar, rum, and soda water makes it the perfect drink for a hot summer day. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a traditional mojito can be a bit of a gamble. Enter the gluten-free mojito—a delicious and safe alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this iconic drink without worry.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Mojito Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>At its core, a mojito is a simple cocktail made with just a few ingredients: rum, lime juice, sugar, mint leaves, and soda water. The primary concern for those avoiding gluten is the rum. While rum is typically made from sugarcane or molasses, which are naturally gluten-free, some brands may use additives or flavorings that contain gluten. Therefore, it's essential to choose a rum that is certified gluten-free to ensure your mojito is safe to drink.</p>

    <p>Here’s a breakdown of the key ingredients and their gluten-free status:</p>
