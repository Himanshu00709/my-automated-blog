    <h1>Gluten-Free Margarita: A Refreshing Twist on a Classic Cocktail</h1>

    <p>Margaritas are a beloved cocktail, known for their tangy, refreshing flavor and versatility. Whether you're lounging on a beach or hosting a party, a margarita is always a crowd-pleaser. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a traditional margarita can be a challenge due to the potential presence of gluten in certain ingredients. Enter the gluten-free margarita—a delicious and safe alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this classic drink without worry.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Margarita Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>At its core, a margarita is made with three primary ingredients: tequila, lime juice, and orange liqueur. The good news is that tequila, made from the agave plant, is naturally gluten-free. However, the orange liqueur and any additional flavorings or mixers can sometimes contain gluten. To ensure your margarita is gluten-free, it's essential to choose ingredients carefully and verify their gluten-free status.</p>
