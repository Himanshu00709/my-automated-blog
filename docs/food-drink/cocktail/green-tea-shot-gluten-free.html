    <h1>Green Tea Shot: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>Green tea shots have become a popular choice for those looking to enjoy a quick, refreshing drink that packs a punch. But what exactly is a green tea shot, and is it gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the world of green tea shots, exploring their ingredients, benefits, and how they fit into a gluten-free lifestyle. Whether you're a cocktail enthusiast or someone with dietary restrictions, this guide will provide you with all the information you need to enjoy this delightful drink.</p>

    <h2>What is a Green Tea Shot?</h2>
    <p>Despite its name, a green tea shot doesn’t actually contain green tea. Instead, it’s a cocktail made with a combination of whiskey, peach schnapps, sour mix, and sometimes a splash of lemon-lime soda. The drink gets its name from its vibrant green color, which resembles that of green tea. It’s a sweet, tangy, and slightly boozy shot that’s perfect for parties or a night out.</p>

    <h2>Is a Green Tea Shot Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>For those who follow a gluten-free diet, the question of whether a green tea shot is safe to consume is an important one. The good news is that, in most cases, a green tea shot can be gluten-free. However, it’s essential to check the ingredients of each component to ensure they don’t contain any gluten. Here’s a breakdown of the typical ingredients and their gluten status:</p>

                <td>Lemon-Lime Soda</td>
                <td>Most brands are gluten-free, but always double-check.</td>
