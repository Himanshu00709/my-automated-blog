    <h1>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Beer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply choosing to avoid gluten, finding a satisfying alternative to traditional beer can be a challenge. Beer is traditionally made from barley, wheat, or rye, all of which contain gluten. However, the growing demand for gluten-free options has led to the development of a variety of delicious and refreshing gluten-free beers and other beverages. In this article, we will explore the world of gluten-free beer alternatives, including their ingredients, brewing processes, and where to find them.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Beer Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free beer is made using grains that do not contain gluten, such as sorghum, millet, rice, corn, or buckwheat. Some breweries also use enzymes to break down gluten in traditional beer, making it safe for those with gluten intolerance. However, it's important to note that not all gluten-free beers are created equal. Some may still contain trace amounts of gluten, so it's crucial to check the label and ensure the product is certified gluten-free.</p>
