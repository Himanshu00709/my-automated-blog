<h1>Spanish Gluten-Free Beer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Spain, a country renowned for its vibrant culture, delicious cuisine, and world-class beverages, has also made significant strides in the gluten-free beer market. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding a beer that is both safe and enjoyable can be a challenge. Fortunately, Spanish breweries have risen to the occasion, offering a variety of gluten-free beers that cater to this growing demand. In this article, we will explore the world of Spanish gluten-free beer, highlighting popular brands, brewing techniques, and what makes these beers stand out.</p>

<h2>What Makes a Beer Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free beer is brewed without the use of gluten-containing grains such as barley, wheat, or rye. Instead, brewers use alternative grains like sorghum, rice, millet, or corn. Some breweries also use enzymes to break down gluten proteins in traditional grains, making the beer safe for those with gluten intolerance. In Spain, the production of gluten-free beer adheres to strict regulations to ensure that the final product contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>
