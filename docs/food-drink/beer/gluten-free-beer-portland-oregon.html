    <h2>What Makes Gluten-Free Beer Different?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free beer is made without the use of barley, wheat, or rye, which are the traditional grains used in brewing.

Some breweries also use enzymes to break down gluten proteins in traditional grains, creating gluten-reduced beers that are safe for most people with gluten sensitivities. However, those with celiac disease should stick to beers that are certified gluten-free.</p>
