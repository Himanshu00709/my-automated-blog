    <h1>Gluten-Free Beer: A Deep Dive into Heineken's Offering</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Among the many products that have been reformulated to meet this demand, beer stands out as a particularly challenging one. Traditional beer is made from barley, wheat, or rye—all of which contain gluten. However, breweries around the world have risen to the challenge, and Heineken is one of the pioneers in this space. In this article, we’ll explore Heineken’s gluten-free beer, its brewing process, and why it’s a game-changer for beer lovers with gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Heineken’s Gluten-Free Beer Special?</h2>

    <p>Heineken’s gluten-free beer is a testament to the brand’s commitment to innovation and inclusivity. Unlike many other gluten-free beers that use alternative grains like sorghum or rice, Heineken has managed to create a beer that retains the classic taste and quality of their original lager while being safe for those with gluten sensitivities. This is achieved through a meticulous brewing process that removes gluten proteins without compromising on flavor.</p>

    <p>One of the key factors that set Heineken’s gluten-free beer apart is its adherence to the same high standards of quality that the brand is known for. The beer is brewed using the same ingredients as the original Heineken lager, but with an additional step to ensure that the gluten content is reduced to below 20 parts per million (ppm), which is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>The Brewing Process: How Heineken Achieves Gluten-Free Status</h2>

    <p>The brewing process for Heineken’s gluten-free beer is a fascinating blend of traditional techniques and modern innovation. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how it’s done:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Step</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1. Malting</td>
                <td>Barley is malted to convert starches into fermentable sugars. This is the same process used in traditional brewing.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2. Mashing</td>
                <td>The malted barley is mashed with water to extract the sugars. This step is crucial for developing the beer’s flavor profile.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3. Fermentation</td>
                <td>Yeast is added to the wort (the liquid extracted from the mashing process) to ferment the sugars into alcohol.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4. Gluten Removal</td>
                <td>After fermentation, the beer undergoes a specialized filtration process to remove gluten proteins. This step ensures that the gluten content is reduced to below 20 ppm.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5. Packaging</td>
                <td>The beer is then packaged and ready for distribution, maintaining the same crisp and refreshing taste that Heineken is known for.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
