<h1>Stone Brewery Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Stone Brewery has long been a name synonymous with bold flavors, innovative brewing techniques, and a commitment to quality. But for those who follow a gluten-free diet, the question often arises: Does Stone Brewery offer gluten-free options? In this article, we’ll dive deep into Stone Brewery’s gluten-free offerings, their brewing process, and what makes them stand out in the craft beer industry.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Beer</h2>

<p>Gluten-free beer is crafted to cater to individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Traditional beer is made from barley, wheat, or rye, all of which contain gluten.

The process requires meticulous attention to avoid cross-contamination, ensuring the final product is safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

<h2>The Brewing Process: How Stone Brewery Ensures Gluten-Free Quality</h2>

<p>Stone Brewery’s commitment to quality extends to their gluten-free brewing process. They use a combination of alternative grains and a specialized enzyme to break down gluten proteins, ensuring that the final product contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold for being considered gluten-free. Additionally, they implement rigorous testing protocols to verify that their gluten-free beers meet these standards.</p>

<p>Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of their gluten-free brewing process:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Selection of Gluten-Free Grains:</strong> Stone Brewery carefully selects gluten-free grains such as sorghum, rice, or millet to use as the base for their gluten-free beers.</li>
    <li><strong>Brewing:</strong> The grains are mashed and boiled, just like in traditional brewing, but with the absence of gluten-containing grains.</li>
    <li><strong>Enzyme Treatment:</strong> A specialized enzyme is added during the brewing process to break down any residual gluten proteins.</li>
    <li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> The wort is fermented using yeast, which converts sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.</li>
    <li><strong>Testing:</strong> The final product is rigorously tested to ensure it meets the gluten-free standard of less than 20 ppm of gluten.</li>
</ol>
