    <h2>The Brewing Process of Daura Damm</h2>
    <p>The brewing process of Daura Damm is a testament to the brewery's commitment to quality. The beer is brewed using barley, which is naturally high in gluten.

The result is a beer that retains the traditional flavors and aromas of a classic lager, but without the gluten.</p>

    <p>The process begins with the selection of high-quality barley, which is then malted and mashed.

The final product is a beer that is not only safe for those with celiac disease but also delicious and satisfying.</p>
