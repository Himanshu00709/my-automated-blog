    <h1>Coors Gluten-Free Beer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For beer enthusiasts who are gluten-intolerant or have celiac disease, finding a beer that is both delicious and safe to consume can be a challenge. Enter Coors Gluten-Free Beer, a refreshing option that promises the same great taste you expect from Coors, but without the gluten. In this article, we’ll dive deep into what makes Coors Gluten-Free Beer a standout choice, its brewing process, nutritional information, and more.</p>

    <h2>What is Coors Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>
    <p>Coors Gluten-Free Beer is a specially crafted beverage designed for those who need or prefer to avoid gluten. Unlike traditional beers that are made from barley or wheat, Coors Gluten-Free Beer is brewed using alternative grains such as sorghum, rice, or corn. This ensures that the beer contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, making it safe for most people with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>The Brewing Process</h2>
    <p>The brewing process for Coors Gluten-Free Beer is meticulous and designed to eliminate gluten while maintaining the beer’s signature flavor. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Selection of Gluten-Free Grains:</strong> The process begins with the careful selection of gluten-free grains such as sorghum, rice, or corn. These grains are naturally gluten-free and provide the base for the beer.</li>
        <li><strong>Mashing:</strong> The grains are mashed to extract fermentable sugars. This step is crucial as it determines the beer’s flavor profile and alcohol content.</li>
        <li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> The extracted sugars are then fermented using specific yeast strains that are gluten-free. This fermentation process is closely monitored to ensure that no gluten contamination occurs.</li>
        <li><strong>Filtration:</strong> After fermentation, the beer undergoes a rigorous filtration process to remove any remaining gluten particles. This step ensures that the final product meets the gluten-free standard of less than 20 ppm.</li>
        <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> Finally, the beer is packaged in a controlled environment to prevent cross-contamination with gluten-containing products.</li>
