<p>It’s important to note that while these beers are labeled as gluten-reduced, they are not entirely gluten-free. Stone Brewing uses an enzyme called Clarex during the brewing process, which breaks down gluten proteins to levels that are generally considered safe for most people with gluten sensitivity. However, those with celiac disease should exercise caution and consult with a healthcare professional before consuming these beers.</p>

<h2>The Brewing Process: How Stone Brewing Achieves Gluten-Reduced Beers</h2>

This includes testing the raw ingredients, the beer during fermentation, and the final product to confirm that the gluten levels meet the required standards.</p>
