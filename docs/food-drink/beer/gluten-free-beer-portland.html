    <h1>Gluten-Free Beer in Portland: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Portland, Oregon, is renowned for its vibrant craft beer scene, and for those who follow a gluten-free diet, the city offers a surprising array of options.

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free beer is essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Traditional beer is made from barley, wheat, or rye, all of which contain gluten. For those who cannot tolerate gluten, consuming these beers can lead to severe health issues. Gluten-free beer, on the other hand, is brewed using alternative grains like sorghum, rice, millet, or even gluten-free oats. These beers are crafted to provide the same rich flavors and aromas as traditional beers, without the gluten.</p>
