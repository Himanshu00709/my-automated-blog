    <h1>Gluten-Free Beer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and the beer industry is no exception. For those with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or simply a preference for gluten-free options, finding a delicious and satisfying gluten-free beer can be a game-changer. This guide will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free beer, including its history, brewing process, popular brands, and where to find it for sale.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free beer is a type of beer that is brewed without gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, or rye. Instead, it is made from alternative grains like sorghum, millet, rice, or corn. Some breweries also use enzymes to break down gluten proteins in traditional grains, making the beer safe for those with gluten sensitivities. The result is a beer that is both flavorful and safe for individuals who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>The History of Gluten-Free Beer</h2>

    <p>The history of gluten-free beer is relatively short compared to traditional beer, which has been brewed for thousands of years. The rise of gluten-free beer can be traced back to the early 2000s when awareness of celiac disease and gluten intolerance began to grow. As more people sought gluten-free alternatives, breweries started experimenting with alternative grains and brewing techniques to create beers that could be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions.</p>

    <h2>How is Gluten-Free Beer Made?</h2>

    <p>The brewing process for gluten-free beer is similar to that of traditional beer, but with a few key differences. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
