<h1>Rice Beer: A Gluten-Free Alternative for Beer Enthusiasts</h1>

<p>For many beer lovers, the discovery of gluten intolerance or celiac disease can feel like a death sentence for their favorite pastime.

    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Step</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1. Malting</td>
            <td>Rice is soaked in water to initiate germination, which activates enzymes that convert starches into fermentable sugars.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2. Mashing</td>
            <td>The malted rice is mixed with water and heated to break down the starches into sugars. This mixture, known as the mash, is then strained to separate the liquid (wort) from the solids.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3. Boiling</td>
            <td>The wort is boiled, and hops or other flavoring agents are added to impart bitterness, flavor, and aroma.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4. Fermentation</td>
            <td>The boiled wort is cooled and transferred to a fermentation vessel, where yeast is added. The yeast consumes the sugars, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5. Conditioning</td>
            <td>After fermentation, the beer is conditioned to allow flavors to mature and any remaining sediments to settle.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6. Packaging</td>
            <td>The finished beer is filtered, carbonated, and packaged into bottles, cans, or kegs for distribution.</td>
        </tr>
