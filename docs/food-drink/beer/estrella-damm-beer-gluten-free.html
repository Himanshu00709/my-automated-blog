<h1>Estrella Damm Beer: A Gluten-Free Option?</h1>

<p>Estrella Damm is one of Spain's most iconic beers, known for its refreshing taste and rich history. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Estrella Damm is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will explore the gluten content in Estrella Damm beer, its brewing process, and whether it can be considered a safe option for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten in Beer</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, which are common ingredients in traditional beer brewing. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. As a result, the demand for gluten-free beer has grown significantly in recent years.</p>

<p>Traditional beers, including many lagers and ales, are brewed using barley, which contains gluten. However, some breweries have started producing gluten-free beers using alternative grains such as sorghum, rice, or millet. The question is, where does Estrella Damm fit into this spectrum?</p>

<h2>Is Estrella Damm Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Estrella Damm is a traditional lager brewed using barley malt, which means it contains gluten. As such, it is not considered a gluten-free beer. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming Estrella Damm could lead to adverse health effects.</p>

<p>However, it's worth noting that Estrella Damm has introduced a gluten-free variant called <strong>Estrella Damm Daura</strong>. This beer is specifically brewed to remove gluten, making it a suitable option for those who need to avoid gluten in their diet.</p>

<h3>Estrella Damm Daura: The Gluten-Free Alternative</h3>

<p>Estrella Damm Daura is a gluten-free beer that has been crafted to cater to the needs of individuals with gluten intolerance. The brewing process for Daura involves using barley malt, but the gluten is removed through a specialized filtration process. The result is a beer that contains less than 6 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is well below the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

<p>Here’s a comparison between Estrella Damm and Estrella Damm Daura:</p>
