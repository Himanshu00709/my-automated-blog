    <h1>Does Stella Beer Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Stella Artois is one of the most popular beers in the world, known for its crisp taste and rich history. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, the question of whether Stella beer contains gluten is of paramount importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of Stella Artois, its brewing process, and whether it is safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten in Beer</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions. Traditional beers are typically brewed using barley, which contains gluten, making them unsuitable for those who need to avoid it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients and Brewing Process of Stella Artois</h2>
    <p>Stella Artois is a Belgian pilsner that has been brewed since 1926. The beer is made using a combination of malted barley, hops, water, and yeast. The brewing process involves fermenting the barley, which is a gluten-containing grain. As a result, Stella Artois is not considered gluten-free.</p>
