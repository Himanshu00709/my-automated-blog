<h1>Pumpkin Beer Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>As the leaves change color and the air turns crisp, pumpkin-flavored everything begins to take over the culinary world.

        <tr>
            <td>1. Selecting Gluten-Free Grains</td>
            <td>Brewers use gluten-free grains like sorghum, rice, millet, or buckwheat as the base for the beer. These grains are milled and mashed to extract fermentable sugars.</td>
