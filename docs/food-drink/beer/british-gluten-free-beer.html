    <h2>How Gluten-Free Beer is Made</h2>

    <p>The production of gluten-free beer involves a few key steps that differentiate it from traditional beer brewing. Here’s a brief overview of the process:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Selection of Gluten-Free Grains:</strong> Brewers choose grains that are naturally gluten-free, such as sorghum, millet, rice, or corn. These grains are used as the base for the beer.</li>
        <li><strong>Mashing:</strong> The grains are mashed to extract fermentable sugars. This process is similar to traditional brewing but uses gluten-free ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> Yeast is added to the mash to ferment the sugars, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide. The type of yeast used can influence the flavor profile of the beer.</li>
        <li><strong>Filtration:</strong> Some breweries use enzymes to break down any remaining gluten proteins, ensuring that the final product is safe for those with gluten intolerance.</li>
        <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> The beer is then packaged and labeled as gluten-free, often with certifications to assure consumers of its safety.</li>
    </ol>
