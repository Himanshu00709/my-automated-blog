    <h1>Gluten-Free Beer: A Deep Dive into Daura Damm</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of celiac disease and gluten intolerance. Among the many gluten-free options available, gluten-free beer has carved out a niche for itself, offering a refreshing alternative for those who cannot consume traditional barley-based beers. One of the most popular gluten-free beers on the market is Daura Damm, a Spanish beer that has gained international acclaim for its taste and quality. In this article, we will explore the world of gluten-free beer, with a particular focus on Daura Damm, its brewing process, nutritional profile, and why it stands out in the crowded beer market.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free beer is a type of beer that is brewed without the use of gluten-containing grains such as barley, wheat, or rye. Instead, these beers are made from alternative grains like sorghum, rice, millet, or corn. The absence of gluten makes these beers safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, brewing a gluten-free beer that retains the flavor and texture of traditional beer is no easy task. This is where Daura Damm excels, offering a beer that not only meets gluten-free standards but also delivers a rich, satisfying taste.</p>

    <h2>The Brewing Process of Daura Damm</h2>

    <p>Daura Damm is brewed by the Spanish company Estrella Damm, which has been producing beer since 1876. The brewing process of Daura Damm is unique in that it starts with traditional barley malt, which contains gluten. However, through a proprietary process, the gluten content is reduced to less than 6 parts per million (ppm), which is well below the threshold of 20 ppm considered safe for most people with celiac disease. This process involves the use of enzymes that break down the gluten proteins, making the beer safe for consumption without compromising on flavor.</p>

    <p>The result is a beer that has the same aroma, body, and taste as a traditional lager, but with the added benefit of being gluten-free. Daura Damm is available in several varieties, including Daura Original, Daura Marzen, and Daura IPA, each offering a unique flavor profile to suit different preferences.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Profile of Daura Damm</h2>
