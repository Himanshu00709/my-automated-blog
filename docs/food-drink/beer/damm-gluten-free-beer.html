    <h1>Exploring the World of Gluten-Free Beer</h1>
    <p>For beer enthusiasts with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the rise of gluten-free beer has been nothing short of a revolution. Gone are the days when avoiding gluten meant sacrificing the joy of a cold, refreshing beer. Today, the market is brimming with gluten-free options that cater to a variety of tastes and preferences. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the world of gluten-free beer, exploring its origins, production methods, popular brands, and what makes it a great choice for those seeking a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free beer is a type of beer that is brewed without the use of gluten-containing grains such as barley, wheat, or rye. Instead, brewers use alternative grains like sorghum, millet, rice, or corn to create a beer that is safe for those with gluten intolerances or celiac disease. The result is a beverage that mimics the taste and texture of traditional beer but without the gluten.</p>

    <h2>How is Gluten-Free Beer Made?</h2>
    <p>The process of making gluten-free beer is similar to that of traditional beer, with a few key differences. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Step</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1. Malting</td>
            <td>Instead of barley or wheat, gluten-free grains like sorghum or millet are malted. This involves soaking the grains in water, allowing them to germinate, and then drying them to stop the germination process.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2. Mashing</td>
            <td>The malted grains are then mashed, which involves mixing them with hot water to extract fermentable sugars. This creates a sweet liquid known as wort.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3. Boiling</td>
            <td>The wort is boiled, and hops are added for flavor and aroma. Hops are naturally gluten-free, so they can be used in gluten-free beer without any issues.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4. Fermentation</td>
            <td>After boiling, the wort is cooled and transferred to a fermentation vessel. Yeast is added, which consumes the sugars and produces alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5. Conditioning</td>
            <td>Once fermentation is complete, the beer is conditioned, which allows the flavors to mature and develop. This step can take a few weeks to several months, depending on the style of beer.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6. Packaging</td>
            <td>Finally, the beer is filtered, carbonated, and packaged into bottles, cans, or kegs, ready to be enjoyed.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
