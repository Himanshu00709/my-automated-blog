<h1>Best Gluten-Free Lager: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For those who are gluten-intolerant or have celiac disease, finding a good gluten-free lager can be a challenge. However, the market has evolved significantly over the years, and there are now several excellent options available. In this article, we will explore the best gluten-free lagers, their unique characteristics, and what makes them stand out. Whether you're a beer enthusiast or someone looking to enjoy a cold one without the gluten, this guide will help you make an informed choice.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten-Free Lager?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free lager is a type of beer that is brewed without gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, or rye. Instead, these beers are made from alternative grains like sorghum, rice, millet, or corn. The brewing process is carefully managed to ensure that the final product contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most people with gluten sensitivities.</p>
