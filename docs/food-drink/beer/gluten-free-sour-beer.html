    <h1>Gluten-Free Sour Beer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the craft beer industry has seen a surge in the popularity of sour beers. These tart, tangy, and often complex brews have captured the hearts of beer enthusiasts worldwide. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a sour beer can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free sour beer—a delicious and inclusive option that allows everyone to partake in the sour beer revolution. In this article, we’ll explore what gluten-free sour beer is, how it’s made, and why it’s becoming a favorite among beer lovers.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Sour Beer?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free sour beer is a type of beer that is brewed without gluten-containing grains such as barley, wheat, or rye. Instead, it uses alternative grains like sorghum, millet, rice, or buckwheat. The sourness in these beers comes from the fermentation process, where wild yeast strains or bacteria like <em>Lactobacillus</em> and <em>Pediococcus</em> are introduced to create a tart flavor profile. The result is a beer that is both gluten-free and delightfully sour, offering a unique drinking experience.</p>

    <h2>The Brewing Process of Gluten-Free Sour Beer</h2>

    <p>Brewing gluten-free sour beer is a meticulous process that requires careful attention to detail. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how it’s done:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Step</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1. Selecting Gluten-Free Grains</td>
                <td>Brewers choose gluten-free grains like sorghum, millet, or rice as the base for the beer. These grains are milled and mashed to extract fermentable sugars.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2. Fermentation</td>
                <td>The mash is boiled, and hops are added for bitterness. After cooling, the wort is transferred to a fermentation vessel where yeast and bacteria are added. The bacteria, such as <em>Lactobacillus</em>, produce lactic acid, which gives the beer its sour taste.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3. Aging</td>
                <td>The beer is aged in barrels or tanks for several months to develop its complex flavors. During this time, the bacteria continue to work, enhancing the sourness.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4. Packaging</td>
                <td>Once the desired flavor profile is achieved, the beer is filtered, carbonated, and packaged. Some brewers may add fruit or other flavorings during this stage to create unique variations.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
