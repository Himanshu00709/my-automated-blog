<h2>The Brewing Process: How Stone Delicious IPA Gluten-Free is Made</h2>

<p>Creating a gluten-free beer that doesn’t compromise on taste is no small feat. Stone Brewing’s approach involves a combination of traditional brewing techniques and innovative methods. Here’s a step-by-step look at how the Stone Delicious IPA Gluten-Free is crafted:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Mashing:</strong> The process begins with mashing barley and wheat, which are typically high in gluten. However, Stone Brewing uses an enzyme called Clarex during this stage. This enzyme breaks down the gluten proteins, rendering the beer gluten-free.</li>
    <li><strong>Boiling:</strong> The mash is then boiled, and hops are added at various stages to achieve the desired bitterness and aroma. For the Stone Delicious IPA, Lemondrop and El Dorado hops are used to impart the signature citrusy flavors.</li>
    <li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> After boiling, the wort is cooled and transferred to fermentation tanks. Yeast is added, and the mixture is left to ferment for several weeks. During this time, the yeast converts the sugars into alcohol, and the beer develops its characteristic flavors.</li>
    <li><strong>Conditioning:</strong> Once fermentation is complete, the beer is conditioned to allow the flavors to meld and mature. This step is crucial for achieving the balanced taste that Stone Delicious IPA is known for.</li>
    <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> Finally, the beer is filtered, carbonated, and packaged. Stone Brewing ensures that the gluten-free status is maintained throughout the packaging process to meet the strict standards for gluten-free certification.</li>
</ol>
