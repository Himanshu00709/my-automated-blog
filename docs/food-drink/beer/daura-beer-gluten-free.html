    <h1>Daura Beer: A Gluten-Free Revolution in the World of Craft Brews</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten intolerance. Among the many gluten-free options available today, Daura Beer stands out as a pioneer in the craft beer industry. Brewed by the Spanish company Estrella Damm, Daura Beer has become a favorite among beer enthusiasts who seek a gluten-free alternative without compromising on taste or quality. This article delves into the history, brewing process, and unique characteristics of Daura Beer, offering a comprehensive guide for those curious about this gluten-free gem.</p>

    <h2>The Rise of Gluten-Free Beer</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free beer has emerged as a significant segment in the beverage market, catering to individuals who must avoid gluten due to medical conditions or personal preferences. Traditional beer is made from barley, wheat, or rye, all of which contain gluten. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming these beers can lead to severe health issues. This has led to the development of gluten-free beers, which are brewed using alternative grains such as sorghum, rice, or millet.</p>

    <p>Daura Beer, however, takes a different approach. Instead of using alternative grains, it is brewed from barley and then undergoes a specialized process to remove the gluten, making it safe for most people with gluten intolerance. This innovative method allows Daura Beer to retain the classic flavor profile of traditional beer, setting it apart from other gluten-free options.</p>

    <h2>The Brewing Process of Daura Beer</h2>

    <p>The brewing process of Daura Beer is a testament to the ingenuity and dedication of Estrella Damm. The beer starts with high-quality barley, which is malted and mashed to extract the sugars needed for fermentation. After the initial brewing process, the beer undergoes a proprietary gluten-removal process. This involves the use of enzymes that break down the gluten proteins into smaller fragments, reducing the gluten content to below 20 parts per million (ppm), the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

    <p>Here’s a breakdown of the key steps in the brewing process:</p>

            <tr>
                <td>Malting</td>
                <td>Barley is soaked, germinated, and dried to produce malt.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Mashing</td>
                <td>The malt is mixed with water to extract fermentable sugars.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Fermentation</td>
                <td>Yeast is added to the wort to convert sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Gluten Removal</td>
                <td>Enzymes are used to break down gluten proteins, reducing gluten content to below 20 ppm.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Filtration</td>
                <td>The beer is filtered to remove any remaining solids and clarify the liquid.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Packaging</td>
                <td>The beer is bottled or canned, ready for distribution.</td>
            </tr>
