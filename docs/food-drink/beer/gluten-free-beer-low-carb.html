<h2>How is Gluten-Free Low-Carb Beer Made?</h2>

<p>The brewing process for gluten-free low-carb beer is similar to traditional beer brewing but with a few key differences. Here’s a step-by-step overview:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Grain Selection:</strong> Instead of barley or wheat, brewers use gluten-free grains like sorghum, rice, millet, or quinoa.</li>
    <li><strong>Mashing:</strong> The grains are mashed to extract fermentable sugars. This step is crucial for determining the beer’s flavor and carbohydrate content.</li>
    <li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> Yeast is added to ferment the sugars, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide. Some brewers use specific yeast strains to reduce carbohydrate content further.</li>
    <li><strong>Filtration:</strong> The beer is filtered to remove any remaining gluten particles, ensuring it meets gluten-free standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Carbonation:</strong> The beer is carbonated and then packaged for distribution.</li>
</ol>
