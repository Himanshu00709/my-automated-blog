    <h1>Gluten-Free Beer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For beer enthusiasts with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, the idea of enjoying a cold brew might seem like a distant dream. However, the rise of gluten-free beer has made it possible for everyone to savor the rich flavors of beer without the adverse effects of gluten. In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free beer, from its production process to the best brands available online.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free beer is a type of beer that is brewed without the use of gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, or rye. Instead, brewers use alternative grains like sorghum, millet, rice, or corn to create a beer that is safe for those with gluten intolerance. The result is a beverage that retains the traditional flavors and aromas of beer but is free from the proteins that can cause health issues for some individuals.</p>

    <h2>How is Gluten-Free Beer Made?</h2>
    <p>The production of gluten-free beer involves a unique brewing process that differs from traditional beer-making. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Selection of Gluten-Free Grains:</strong> Brewers choose grains like sorghum, millet, rice, or corn as the base for the beer. These grains are naturally gluten-free and provide the necessary sugars for fermentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Mashing:</strong> The selected grains are mashed to extract fermentable sugars. This process involves mixing the grains with water and heating them to break down the starches into sugars.</li>
        <li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> The extracted sugars are then fermented using yeast. The yeast consumes the sugars and produces alcohol and carbon dioxide, giving the beer its characteristic flavor and carbonation.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavoring:</strong> Additional ingredients like hops, fruits, or spices may be added to enhance the flavor profile of the beer.</li>
        <li><strong>Filtration and Packaging:</strong> The beer is filtered to remove any remaining solids and then packaged in bottles, cans, or kegs for distribution.</li>
    </ol>
