    <h1>Gluten-Free Michelob Ultra: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and the general trend toward healthier lifestyles. Among the many products that have adapted to this trend is Michelob Ultra, a popular light beer known for its low calorie and carbohydrate content. But is Michelob Ultra gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free Michelob Ultra, including its ingredients, brewing process, and how it fits into a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>What is Michelob Ultra?</h2>

    <p>Michelob Ultra is a light lager beer introduced by Anheuser-Busch in 2002. It has gained popularity among health-conscious consumers due to its low calorie and carbohydrate content. With only 95 calories and 2.6 grams of carbs per 12-ounce serving, Michelob Ultra is often marketed as a beer for those who lead an active lifestyle. But what about its gluten content?</p>

    <h2>Is Michelob Ultra Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Michelob Ultra is not entirely gluten-free. Traditional Michelob Ultra is brewed with barley, which contains gluten. However, Anheuser-Busch has recognized the growing demand for gluten-free options and has introduced Michelob Ultra Pure Gold, a gluten-free version of the beer. Michelob Ultra Pure Gold is brewed with organic grains, including sorghum, which is naturally gluten-free. This makes it a suitable option for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients and Brewing Process</h2>

    <p>Understanding the ingredients and brewing process is crucial when determining whether a beer is gluten-free. Let’s take a closer look at the ingredients and brewing process of both traditional Michelob Ultra and Michelob Ultra Pure Gold.</p>

    <h3>Traditional Michelob Ultra</h3>

    <p>Traditional Michelob Ultra is brewed with the following ingredients:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Barley malt</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Hops</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Barley malt contains gluten, which means that traditional Michelob Ultra is not suitable for those on a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h3>Michelob Ultra Pure Gold</h3>

    <p>Michelob Ultra Pure Gold, on the other hand, is brewed with organic grains, including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Organic sorghum</li>
        <li>Organic rice</li>
        <li>Hops</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Since sorghum is naturally gluten-free, Michelob Ultra Pure Gold is a safe option for those who need to avoid gluten. Additionally, it is certified gluten-free by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO), ensuring that it meets strict gluten-free standards.</p>
