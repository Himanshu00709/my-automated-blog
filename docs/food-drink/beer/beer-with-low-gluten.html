    <h1>Exploring Low-Gluten Beer: A Guide for Beer Enthusiasts</h1>
    <p>Beer has been a beloved beverage for centuries, enjoyed by people across the globe. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional beer can be off-limits due to its gluten content. Fortunately, the rise of low-gluten and gluten-free beers has opened up new possibilities for beer lovers who need to avoid gluten. In this article, we’ll dive into the world of low-gluten beer, exploring what it is, how it’s made, and some of the best options available today.</p>

    <h2>What is Low-Gluten Beer?</h2>
    <p>Low-gluten beer is a type of beer that contains significantly less gluten than traditional beers. Traditional beers are typically made from barley, wheat, or rye, all of which are high in gluten. Low-gluten beers, on the other hand, are often made from alternative grains such as sorghum, millet, rice, or corn, which naturally contain little to no gluten. Some low-gluten beers are also made using a process that breaks down gluten proteins, making them safe for those with mild gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <h2>How is Low-Gluten Beer Made?</h2>
    <p>The production of low-gluten beer involves either using gluten-free grains or employing a process to reduce gluten content. Here’s a breakdown of the two main methods:</p>

    <h3>1. Using Gluten-Free Grains</h3>
    <p>Brewers can create low-gluten beer by using grains that are naturally gluten-free. Common alternatives include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sorghum:</strong> A versatile grain that adds a slightly sweet flavor to beer.</li>
        <li><strong>Millet:</strong> Known for its light, crisp taste, millet is a popular choice for gluten-free brewing.</li>
        <li><strong>Rice:</strong> Often used in lighter beers, rice contributes a clean, refreshing taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Corn:</strong> Adds a mild sweetness and is commonly used in American lagers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Gluten Reduction Process</h3>
    <p>Some breweries use enzymes to break down gluten proteins in traditional grains like barley or wheat. This process reduces the gluten content to levels that are considered safe for most people with gluten sensitivities. However, it’s important to note that these beers may still contain trace amounts of gluten and may not be suitable for those with celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Popular Low-Gluten Beer Brands</h2>
    <p>With the growing demand for low-gluten options, many breweries have started producing beers that cater to gluten-sensitive consumers. Here are some popular low-gluten beer brands:</p>
