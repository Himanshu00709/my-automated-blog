    <h1>Stella Artois Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Stella Artois, a name synonymous with premium Belgian beer, has long been celebrated for its rich history and exceptional quality. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a classic Stella Artois has often been off the table. But what if we told you that Stella Artois has ventured into the gluten-free market? In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about Stella Artois Gluten-Free, from its brewing process to its taste profile, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Stella Artois Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Stella Artois Gluten-Free is crafted using a unique brewing process that removes gluten while maintaining the beer’s signature flavor. Traditional Stella Artois is brewed with barley, which contains gluten. However, the gluten-free version uses a combination of alternative grains and advanced filtration techniques to ensure that the final product contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, the threshold considered safe for most people with gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <p>The brewing process involves:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Alternative Grains:</strong> Instead of barley, Stella Artois Gluten-Free uses grains like sorghum, millet, and rice, which are naturally gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Enzymatic Treatment:</strong> Special enzymes are added during the brewing process to break down any residual gluten proteins.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Filtration:</strong> The beer undergoes a rigorous filtration process to remove any remaining gluten particles, ensuring it meets the gluten-free standard.</li>
    </ul>
