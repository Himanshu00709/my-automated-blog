<h1>Gluten-Free Beer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For beer enthusiasts with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, the idea of enjoying a cold brew might seem like a distant dream.

In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free beer, its production, benefits, and some of the best options available today.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free beer is a type of beer that is brewed without the use of gluten-containing grains such as barley, wheat, or rye. Instead, it is made from alternative grains like sorghum, millet, rice, or corn. Some breweries also use enzymes to break down gluten in traditional beers, making them safe for those with gluten intolerance. However, it’s important to note that not all gluten-free beers are created equal, and the methods used to produce them can vary significantly.</p>

<h2>How is Gluten-Free Beer Made?</h2>

<p>The production of gluten-free beer involves several key steps, each of which is crucial to ensuring the final product is safe for those with gluten sensitivities. Here’s a breakdown of the process:</p>
