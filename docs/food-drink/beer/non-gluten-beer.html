    <h1>Non-Gluten Beer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for non-gluten beer has surged, driven by the growing awareness of gluten-related health issues and the increasing popularity of gluten-free diets. Whether you're a beer enthusiast with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply someone looking to explore new flavors, non-gluten beer offers a refreshing alternative to traditional brews. This guide delves into the world of non-gluten beer, exploring its origins, brewing process, health benefits, and some of the best options available today.</p>

    <h2>What is Non-Gluten Beer?</h2>

    <p>Non-gluten beer, also known as gluten-free beer, is a type of beer that is brewed without the use of gluten-containing grains such as barley, wheat, or rye. Instead, brewers use alternative grains like sorghum, millet, rice, corn, or quinoa to create a beer that is safe for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. The result is a beverage that retains the flavor and complexity of traditional beer while being accessible to a wider audience.</p>

    <h2>The Brewing Process of Non-Gluten Beer</h2>

    <p>The brewing process for non-gluten beer is similar to that of traditional beer, with a few key differences. The primary distinction lies in the choice of grains. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how non-gluten beer is made:</p>
