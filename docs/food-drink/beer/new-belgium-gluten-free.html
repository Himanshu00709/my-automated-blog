    <h1>New Belgium Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and the beer industry is no exception. New Belgium Brewing, a pioneer in the craft beer movement, has responded to this growing demand with a range of gluten-free options that cater to those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake. In this article, we’ll dive deep into New Belgium’s gluten-free offerings, exploring their brewing process, flavor profiles, and what sets them apart in the competitive gluten-free beer market.</p>

    <h2>The Rise of Gluten-Free Beer</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free beer has come a long way since its inception. Initially, the options were limited and often lacked the depth of flavor found in traditional beers. However, with advancements in brewing technology and a better understanding of gluten-free grains, breweries like New Belgium have been able to create gluten-free beers that rival their gluten-containing counterparts in both taste and quality.</p>

    <h2>New Belgium’s Gluten-Free Brewing Process</h2>
    <p>New Belgium Brewing has always been at the forefront of innovation, and their approach to gluten-free beer is no different. The brewery uses a combination of gluten-free grains, such as sorghum, millet, and rice, to create a base for their beers. These grains are carefully selected to ensure they provide the necessary enzymes and sugars for fermentation, resulting in a beer that is both gluten-free and full of flavor.</p>

    <p>One of the key aspects of New Belgium’s gluten-free brewing process is their commitment to quality control. The brewery employs rigorous testing methods to ensure that their gluten-free beers contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold set by the FDA for a product to be considered gluten-free. This ensures that even those with severe gluten sensitivities can enjoy New Belgium’s gluten-free offerings without worry.</p>
