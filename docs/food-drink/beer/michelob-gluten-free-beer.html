    <h1>Michelob Gluten-Free Beer: A Detailed Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and the beer industry is no exception. Michelob, a well-known brand under the Anheuser-Busch umbrella, has stepped up to the plate with its Michelob Gluten-Free Beer. This beer is not only a great option for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease but also for anyone looking to enjoy a lighter, refreshing beer without compromising on taste. In this article, we’ll dive deep into what makes Michelob Gluten-Free Beer stand out, its brewing process, nutritional information, and more.</p>

    <h2>What is Michelob Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>
    <p>Michelob Gluten-Free Beer is a premium light lager that is crafted to be free from gluten, making it a safe and enjoyable option for those who need or prefer to avoid gluten in their diet. The beer is brewed using traditional ingredients like water, hops, and yeast, but instead of barley or wheat, it uses a gluten-free grain, typically sorghum. This substitution allows the beer to maintain a crisp, clean taste while being gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>The Brewing Process</h2>
    <p>The brewing process of Michelob Gluten-Free Beer is similar to that of traditional beers, but with a few key differences to ensure the final product is gluten-free. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mashing:</strong> The gluten-free grains, such as sorghum, are mashed to extract fermentable sugars. This step is crucial as it determines the beer’s flavor profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Boiling:</strong> The mash is then boiled, and hops are added for bitterness and aroma. The type and amount of hops used can vary, but they are carefully selected to complement the gluten-free grains.</li>
        <li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> After boiling, the wort (the liquid extracted from the mashing process) is cooled and transferred to fermentation tanks. Yeast is added, and the fermentation process begins, converting sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.</li>
        <li><strong>Filtration:</strong> Once fermentation is complete, the beer is filtered to remove any remaining solids. This step is particularly important for gluten-free beers to ensure no gluten-containing particles are present.</li>
        <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> The final product is then packaged in bottles, cans, or kegs, ready to be enjoyed by consumers.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nutritional Information</h2>
    <p>Michelob Gluten-Free Beer is not only a great option for those avoiding gluten but also for those who are mindful of their calorie and carbohydrate intake. Below is a table summarizing the nutritional information per 12-ounce serving:</p>
