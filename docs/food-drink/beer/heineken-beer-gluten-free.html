    <h1>Is Heineken Beer Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>
    <p>Heineken is one of the most popular beer brands globally, known for its distinctive green bottle and crisp, refreshing taste. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Heineken is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten content in Heineken beer, its ingredients, and alternatives for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Does It Matter?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in grains like wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, inflammation, and nutrient malabsorption. As a result, many people seek gluten-free alternatives to their favorite foods and beverages, including beer.</p>

    <h2>Heineken Beer Ingredients</h2>
    <p>To understand whether Heineken is gluten-free, it’s essential to examine its ingredients. Heineken is brewed using the following primary ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Malted Barley</li>
        <li>Hops</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Barley is a gluten-containing grain, which means that traditional Heineken beer is not gluten-free. However, the brewing process may reduce gluten content to some extent, but it does not eliminate it entirely.</p>

    <h2>Gluten Content in Heineken Beer</h2>
    <p>According to the FDA, for a product to be labeled as gluten-free, it must contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. Traditional Heineken beer contains gluten levels higher than this threshold, making it unsuitable for those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance.</p>
    <p>However, Heineken has introduced a gluten-free version of its beer in some markets, known as <strong>Heineken 0.0 Gluten-Free</strong>. This variant is brewed using a special process that removes gluten, making it safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Heineken 0.0 Gluten-Free: A Safe Alternative</h2>
    <p>Heineken 0.0 Gluten-Free is a non-alcoholic beer that has been specifically crafted to meet the needs of gluten-sensitive individuals. It is brewed using a unique process that ensures the gluten content is below the 20 ppm threshold. Here’s a quick comparison between traditional Heineken and Heineken 0.0 Gluten-Free:</p>

                <td>150 kcal per 12 oz</td>
                <td>69 kcal per 12 oz</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Taste</td>
                <td>Crisp, malty, and slightly bitter</td>
                <td>Light, refreshing, and similar to traditional Heineken</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
