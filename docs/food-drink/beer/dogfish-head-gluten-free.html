    <h2>The Brewing Process: How Dogfish Head Achieves Gluten-Free Perfection</h2>

    <p>Creating a gluten-free beer that doesn’t sacrifice flavor or quality is no small feat. Dogfish Head’s brewing process for their gluten-free beers involves several key steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Grain Selection:</strong> The brewery carefully selects alternative grains such as sorghum, millet, and buckwheat, which are naturally gluten-free. These grains are milled and mashed to extract fermentable sugars.</li>
        <li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> The mash is then transferred to the fermentation vessel, where yeast is added. The yeast ferments the sugars, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process is closely monitored to ensure the desired flavor profile is achieved.</li>
        <li><strong>Conditioning:</strong> After fermentation, the beer is conditioned to allow the flavors to meld and mature. This step is crucial for developing the complex flavors that Dogfish Head is known for.</li>
        <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> Once the beer has reached its peak flavor, it is packaged in bottles or cans. The brewery takes extra care to ensure that the packaging process is free from cross-contamination.</li>
