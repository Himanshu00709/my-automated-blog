    <h1>Estrella Daura Beer: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

    <p>For beer enthusiasts with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a beer that is both safe and delicious can be a challenge. Enter Estrella Daura, a gluten-free beer that has been making waves in the beer community. Brewed by the renowned Spanish brewery, Damm, Estrella Daura offers a refreshing and flavorful alternative to traditional beers. In this article, we will explore the history, brewing process, and unique qualities of Estrella Daura, as well as answer some frequently asked questions about this gluten-free beer.</p>

    <h2>The History of Estrella Daura</h2>

    <p>Estrella Daura is a product of Damm, a Spanish brewery with a rich history dating back to 1876. Damm has long been known for its commitment to quality and innovation, and Estrella Daura is no exception. The beer was first introduced in 2006, making it one of the earliest gluten-free beers on the market. Since then, it has gained a loyal following among those who need or choose to avoid gluten in their diet.</p>

    <p>The name "Daura" is derived from the Latin word "daura," meaning "golden," which perfectly describes the beer's appearance. Estrella Daura is brewed using traditional methods, but with a twist: it is made from barley that has been specially treated to remove gluten, ensuring that it meets the strict gluten-free standards set by the European Union (less than 20 parts per million of gluten).</p>

    <h2>The Brewing Process</h2>

    <p>Estrella Daura is brewed using a unique process that sets it apart from other gluten-free beers. The beer is made from malted barley, which is then treated with an enzyme that breaks down the gluten proteins. This process reduces the gluten content to below the threshold required for a product to be labeled gluten-free. The result is a beer that retains the full flavor and aroma of traditional beer, without the gluten.</p>

    <p>The brewing process begins with the selection of high-quality barley, which is malted and then mashed to extract the sugars needed for fermentation. The wort is then boiled with hops, which add bitterness and aroma to the beer. After boiling, the wort is cooled and fermented with a special strain of yeast that is also gluten-free. The beer is then filtered and carbonated before being packaged and shipped to retailers.</p>

    <h2>Flavor Profile and Pairing Suggestions</h2>

    <p>Estrella Daura is known for its crisp, clean taste and refreshing finish. It has a light golden color and a subtle maltiness, with hints of citrus and floral notes from the hops. The beer has a moderate level of carbonation, which enhances its drinkability and makes it a great choice for warm weather or casual gatherings.</p>

    <p>When it comes to food pairings, Estrella Daura is versatile and can complement a wide range of dishes. Its light and refreshing character makes it an excellent match for seafood, salads, and grilled vegetables. It also pairs well with spicy foods, as the carbonation helps to cleanse the palate. For a more indulgent pairing, try Estrella Daura with a plate of Spanish tapas, such as patatas bravas or gambas al ajillo.</p>
