    <h1>Estrella Daura Beer: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

    <p>For beer enthusiasts who are sensitive to gluten or have celiac disease, finding a beer that is both delicious and safe to consume can be a challenge. Enter Estrella Daura, a gluten-free beer that has been making waves in the craft beer scene. Brewed by the renowned Spanish brewery, Damm, Estrella Daura offers a refreshing and flavorful alternative to traditional beers. In this article, we’ll dive deep into what makes Estrella Daura a standout choice for gluten-free beer lovers.</p>

    <h2>What is Estrella Daura Beer?</h2>

    <p>Estrella Daura is a gluten-free beer crafted by Damm, a Spanish brewery with a rich history dating back to 1876. The beer is brewed using barley malt, but it undergoes a unique process to remove gluten, making it safe for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. The result is a crisp, golden lager with a smooth finish that rivals traditional beers in taste and quality.</p>

    <h2>The Brewing Process</h2>

    <p>One of the key factors that set Estrella Daura apart is its innovative brewing process. The beer is brewed using barley malt, which is naturally high in gluten. However, Damm employs a specialized enzymatic process to break down the gluten proteins, reducing the gluten content to less than 6 parts per million (ppm). This level is well below the threshold of 20 ppm, which is considered safe for most people with gluten sensitivities.</p>
