<h1>Best Gluten-Free Beer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, enjoying a cold beer can be a challenge. Traditional beers are made from barley, wheat, or rye, all of which contain gluten. However, the rise of gluten-free beer options has made it possible for everyone to enjoy a refreshing brew without the worry of adverse health effects. In this article, we’ll explore the best gluten-free beers available, what makes them unique, and how to choose the right one for your palate.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free beer is brewed using grains that do not contain gluten, such as sorghum, rice, millet, or corn. Some breweries also use gluten-removed processes, where the gluten is broken down to levels that are considered safe for most people with gluten intolerance. However, it’s important to note that gluten-removed beers may not be suitable for those with celiac disease, as trace amounts of gluten may still be present.</p>
