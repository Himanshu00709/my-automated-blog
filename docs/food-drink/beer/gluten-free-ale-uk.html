<h2>How is Gluten-Free Ale Made?</h2>

<p>The production of gluten-free ale involves several key steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Selection of Gluten-Free Grains:</strong> Brewers choose grains like sorghum, millet, rice, or corn as the base for the ale. These grains are naturally gluten-free and provide the necessary sugars for fermentation.</li>
    <li><strong>Mashing:</strong> The grains are mashed to extract fermentable sugars. This process is similar to traditional brewing but requires careful handling to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> The extracted sugars are fermented using yeast, which converts the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. The type of yeast used can influence the flavor profile of the ale.</li>
    <li><strong>Filtration:</strong> After fermentation, the ale is filtered to remove any remaining solids. This step is crucial to ensure the final product is clear and free from gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> The finished ale is packaged in bottles, cans, or kegs, ready for distribution. Brewers must ensure that the packaging process is free from gluten contamination.</li>
</ol>
