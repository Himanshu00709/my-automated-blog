    <h1>Gluten-Free Stout: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Stout beer, with its rich, dark, and creamy texture, has long been a favorite among beer enthusiasts. Traditionally brewed with barley, stouts are known for their deep flavors of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying a classic stout can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free stout—a delicious alternative that allows everyone to savor the complex flavors of this beloved beer style. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free stout, from its brewing process to its unique characteristics and where to find the best options.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Stout?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free stout is a variation of traditional stout beer that is brewed without gluten-containing grains like barley, wheat, or rye. Instead, brewers use gluten-free grains such as sorghum, millet, rice, or quinoa to create a beer that is safe for those with gluten sensitivities. Despite the absence of barley, gluten-free stouts aim to replicate the rich, roasted flavors and creamy mouthfeel of their traditional counterparts.</p>

    <h2>The Brewing Process of Gluten-Free Stout</h2>

    <p>Brewing a gluten-free stout requires careful attention to ingredients and process. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how it’s done:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Step</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1. Selecting Gluten-Free Grains</td>
                <td>Brewers choose gluten-free grains like sorghum, millet, or rice as the base. These grains are malted to develop the necessary enzymes for fermentation.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2. Mashing</td>
                <td>The grains are mashed to extract fermentable sugars. This step is crucial for developing the beer’s body and flavor.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3. Boiling and Hopping</td>
                <td>The wort is boiled, and hops are added for bitterness and aroma. Some brewers also add roasted gluten-free grains to mimic the dark, roasted flavors of traditional stouts.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>4. Fermentation</td>
                <td>Yeast is added to the cooled wort to begin fermentation. This process converts sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5. Conditioning</td>
                <td>The beer is conditioned to allow flavors to meld and mature. This step is essential for achieving the smooth, creamy texture of a stout.</td>
