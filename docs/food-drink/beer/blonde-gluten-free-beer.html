<h2>What is Blonde Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>

<h2>The Brewing Process of Blonde Gluten-Free Beer</h2>

<p>Brewing blonde gluten-free beer involves a unique process that differs from traditional beer brewing. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how it’s done:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Step</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1. Selection of Gluten-Free Grains</td>
            <td>Brewers choose gluten-free grains such as sorghum, millet, rice, or corn as the base for the beer. These grains are milled to break them down into a form suitable for brewing.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2. Mashing</td>
            <td>The milled grains are mixed with hot water in a process called mashing. This step activates enzymes that convert the grain's starches into fermentable sugars.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3. Lautering</td>
            <td>The liquid (wort) is separated from the grain solids. This is done by lautering, where the wort is filtered out, leaving behind the spent grains.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4. Boiling</td>
            <td>The wort is boiled, and hops are added for bitterness, flavor, and aroma. This step also sterilizes the wort, ensuring it’s free from unwanted microorganisms.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5. Fermentation</td>
            <td>The wort is cooled and transferred to a fermentation vessel. Yeast is added, which consumes the sugars and produces alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process typically takes one to two weeks.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6. Conditioning</td>
            <td>After fermentation, the beer is conditioned to allow flavors to mature and any remaining yeast to settle. This step can take a few weeks to several months, depending on the desired flavor profile.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>7. Packaging</td>
            <td>Finally, the beer is filtered, carbonated, and packaged into bottles, cans, or kegs, ready for distribution and consumption.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
