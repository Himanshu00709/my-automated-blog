    <h1>Gluten-Free Porter: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For beer enthusiasts with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the quest for a delicious and safe beer can be challenging. Enter the gluten-free porter—a rich, dark, and flavorful alternative that doesn't compromise on taste. In this article, we'll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free porters, from their brewing process to their unique characteristics, and why they are becoming a favorite among beer lovers.</p>

    <h2>What is a Gluten-Free Porter?</h2>
    <p>A gluten-free porter is a type of dark beer that is brewed without gluten-containing grains like barley, wheat, or rye. Instead, brewers use alternative grains such as sorghum, millet, rice, or buckwheat to create a beer that is safe for those with gluten intolerance. Despite the absence of traditional grains, gluten-free porters retain the rich, malty flavors and dark color that porters are known for.</p>

    <h2>The Brewing Process of Gluten-Free Porter</h2>
    <p>Brewing a gluten-free porter requires careful selection of ingredients and a meticulous brewing process. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Step</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1. Selecting Gluten-Free Grains</td>
                <td>Brewers choose gluten-free grains like sorghum, millet, or rice. These grains provide the necessary sugars for fermentation without introducing gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2. Mashing</td>
                <td>The grains are mashed to extract fermentable sugars. This process involves soaking the grains in hot water to break down the starches into sugars.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3. Boiling</td>
                <td>The mash is boiled, and hops are added for bitterness and aroma. Hops are naturally gluten-free, making them safe for gluten-sensitive individuals.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4. Fermentation</td>
                <td>Yeast is added to the cooled wort to begin fermentation. The yeast consumes the sugars, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5. Conditioning</td>
                <td>The beer is conditioned to develop its flavors. This can take several weeks, depending on the desired taste profile.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6. Packaging</td>
                <td>Once conditioned, the beer is packaged in bottles, cans, or kegs, ready for consumption.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
