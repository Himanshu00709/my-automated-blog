    <h1>Low Gluten Beer List: A Guide for Beer Lovers</h1>
    <p>For beer enthusiasts who are sensitive to gluten or have celiac disease, finding a beer that suits their dietary needs can be a challenge. Fortunately, the rise of low gluten and gluten-free beers has made it easier than ever to enjoy a cold one without the worry. In this article, we’ll explore what low gluten beer is, how it’s made, and provide a comprehensive list of some of the best low gluten beers available today.</p>

    <h2>What is Low Gluten Beer?</h2>
    <p>Low gluten beer is a type of beer that contains reduced levels of gluten, making it suitable for individuals with mild gluten sensitivities. Unlike gluten-free beers, which are made from gluten-free grains like sorghum, rice, or millet, low gluten beers are typically brewed from barley or wheat but undergo a process to reduce the gluten content. This process often involves the use of enzymes that break down gluten proteins, making the beer safer for those who need to limit their gluten intake.</p>

    <h2>How is Low Gluten Beer Made?</h2>
    <p>The production of low gluten beer involves a few key steps. First, traditional brewing grains like barley or wheat are used. During the brewing process, enzymes are added to break down the gluten proteins into smaller fragments. These fragments are then removed or reduced to a level that is considered safe for those with gluten sensitivities. It’s important to note that low gluten beer is not completely gluten-free, so individuals with celiac disease should exercise caution and consult with their healthcare provider before consuming these beers.</p>
