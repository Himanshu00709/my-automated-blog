    <h1>Is Michelob Ultra Pure Gold Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>
    <p>Michelob Ultra Pure Gold has gained popularity among health-conscious beer drinkers for its low-calorie and low-carb profile. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question remains: Is Michelob Ultra Pure Gold gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, brewing process, and certifications to determine whether this beer is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten in Beer</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in grains like wheat, barley, and rye. Traditional beers are typically brewed with barley, which contains gluten. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, fatigue, and long-term damage to the small intestine. As a result, many people seek out gluten-free beer options to enjoy without the risk of adverse reactions.</p>

    <h2>What is Michelob Ultra Pure Gold?</h2>
    <p>Michelob Ultra Pure Gold is a light beer marketed as a healthier alternative to traditional beers. It is brewed with organic grains and contains only 85 calories and 2.5 grams of carbohydrates per 12-ounce serving. The beer is also free from artificial colors and flavors, making it an attractive option for those looking to maintain a clean and balanced diet.</p>

    <h2>Is Michelob Ultra Pure Gold Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Michelob Ultra Pure Gold is not certified gluten-free. While it is brewed with organic grains, it still contains barley, which is a gluten-containing grain. However, the brewing process may reduce the gluten content to some extent. According to the FDA, a product can be labeled "gluten-free" if it contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. Michelob Ultra Pure Gold does not meet this standard, and therefore, it is not considered gluten-free.</p>
