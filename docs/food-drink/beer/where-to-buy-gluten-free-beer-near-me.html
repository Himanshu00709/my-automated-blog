<p>For those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply a preference for gluten-free options, finding a good gluten-free beer can be a challenge.

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free beer is made from grains that do not contain gluten, such as sorghum, rice, millet, or corn. Traditional beers are made from barley, wheat, or rye, all of which contain gluten. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and skin problems. Even for those without gluten-related health concerns, gluten-free beer can be a refreshing alternative that offers a unique flavor profile.</p>
