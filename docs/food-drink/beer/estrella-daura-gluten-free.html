    <h1>Estrella Daura Gluten-Free Beer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For those who love beer but need to avoid gluten due to celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding a tasty and safe option can be a challenge. Enter <strong>Estrella Daura</strong>, a gluten-free beer that has gained popularity for its authentic taste and high quality. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about Estrella Daura, from its brewing process to its nutritional profile, and why it stands out in the gluten-free beer market.</p>

    <h2>What is Estrella Daura?</h2>

    <p>Estrella Daura is a gluten-free beer produced by the Spanish brewery <strong>Damm</strong>. It is specifically crafted for individuals who need to avoid gluten but still want to enjoy the taste of a traditional beer. Unlike many gluten-free beers that use alternative grains like sorghum or rice, Estrella Daura is made from barley, which is naturally gluten-containing. However, through a specialized brewing process, the gluten content is reduced to below 6 parts per million (ppm), making it safe for most people with gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>The Brewing Process</h2>

    <p>The secret behind Estrella Daura’s gluten-free status lies in its unique brewing process. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>

            <tr>
                <td>1. Malting</td>
                <td>Barley is malted to convert starches into fermentable sugars.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2. Mashing</td>
                <td>The malted barley is mashed with water to extract sugars and flavors.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3. Fermentation</td>
                <td>Yeast is added to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4. Gluten Reduction</td>
                <td>Special enzymes are used to break down gluten proteins, reducing them to below 6 ppm.</td>
            </tr>

                <td>5. Filtration</td>
                <td>The beer is filtered to remove any remaining gluten particles.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6. Packaging</td>
                <td>The final product is packaged and ready for distribution.</td>
