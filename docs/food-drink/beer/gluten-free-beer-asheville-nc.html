<h1>Gluten-Free Beer in Asheville, NC: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<h2>The Brewing Process of Gluten-Free Beer</h2>

<p>Brewing gluten-free beer requires a different approach compared to traditional beer. The primary difference lies in the choice of grains. Instead of using barley or wheat, gluten-free brewers opt for grains like sorghum, rice, millet, or buckwheat. These grains are naturally gluten-free and provide a unique flavor profile to the beer.</p>

<p>The brewing process begins with the selection of high-quality gluten-free grains. These grains are then malted, mashed, and fermented similarly to traditional brewing methods. However, brewers must ensure that all equipment and facilities are thoroughly cleaned to avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing ingredients. This meticulous attention to detail is crucial to producing a safe and enjoyable gluten-free beer.</p>

<p>In addition to using alternative grains, some breweries employ enzymes that break down gluten proteins during the brewing process. This method allows them to create beers that are technically gluten-removed rather than gluten-free. While these beers may test below the FDA's threshold for gluten content, they may not be suitable for individuals with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>
