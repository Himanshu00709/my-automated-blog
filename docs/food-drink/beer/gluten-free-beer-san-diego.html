    <h1>Gluten-Free Beer in San Diego: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>San Diego, often referred to as the "Craft Beer Capital of America," is a haven for beer enthusiasts. With over 150 breweries, the city offers a diverse range of beer styles, from hoppy IPAs to rich stouts. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a safe and delicious beer can be a challenge. Fortunately, San Diego's craft beer scene has embraced the gluten-free movement, offering a variety of options that cater to gluten-free drinkers. In this guide, we’ll explore the best gluten-free beers in San Diego, where to find them, and what makes them unique.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free beer is brewed without the use of gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, or rye. Instead, brewers use alternative grains like sorghum, millet, rice, or corn. Some breweries also use enzymes to break down gluten proteins in traditional beer, making it safe for those with gluten sensitivities. However, it’s important to note that not all gluten-free beers are created equal. Some may still contain trace amounts of gluten, so it’s crucial to check the labeling and certifications if you have celiac disease.</p>
