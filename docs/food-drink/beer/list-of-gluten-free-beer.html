    <h1>Gluten-Free Beer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, enjoying a cold beer can be a challenge. Traditional beers are made from barley, wheat, or rye, all of which contain gluten. However, the growing demand for gluten-free options has led to the development of a variety of gluten-free beers that cater to those who need to avoid gluten. In this article, we will explore some of the best gluten-free beers available, their unique characteristics, and what makes them stand out in the market.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free beer is brewed using ingredients that do not contain gluten, such as sorghum, rice, millet, or corn. Some breweries also use enzymes to break down gluten in traditional grains, making the beer safe for those with gluten intolerance. It's important to note that not all gluten-free beers are created equal, and the taste and quality can vary significantly between brands.</p>
