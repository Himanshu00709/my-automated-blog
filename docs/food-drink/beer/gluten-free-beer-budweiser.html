    <h1>Gluten-Free Beer: Budweiser's Take on a Healthier Brew</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by a growing awareness of gluten-related health issues such as celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. The beer industry, traditionally reliant on barley and wheat, has been challenged to adapt. Enter Budweiser, one of the most iconic beer brands in the world, which has stepped up to the plate with its gluten-free offering. This article delves into Budweiser's gluten-free beer, exploring its ingredients, brewing process, and how it compares to traditional beers.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free beer is a type of beer that is brewed without the use of gluten-containing grains such as barley, wheat, or rye. Instead, these beers are made from alternative grains like sorghum, rice, millet, or corn. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, gluten-free beer provides a safe and enjoyable alternative to traditional beers.</p>

    <p>Budweiser's gluten-free beer is crafted to meet the needs of this growing market. By using a combination of rice and other gluten-free grains, Budweiser has managed to create a beer that retains the classic taste and quality that the brand is known for, while also being safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>The Brewing Process of Budweiser's Gluten-Free Beer</h2>

    <p>The brewing process for Budweiser's gluten-free beer is similar to that of traditional beer, with a few key differences. The primary difference lies in the ingredients used. Instead of barley, Budweiser uses rice as the main grain. Rice is naturally gluten-free and provides a light, crisp flavor that is characteristic of Budweiser's beers.</p>

    <p>Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the brewing process:</p>
