    <h1>Beers Under 20 ppm Gluten: A Guide for Gluten-Sensitive Drinkers</h1>

    <p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a cold beer can often feel like a distant dream. Traditional beers are brewed with barley, wheat, or rye—all of which contain gluten. However, the rise of gluten-free and gluten-reduced beers has opened up a world of possibilities for beer lovers who need to avoid gluten. In this guide, we’ll explore beers that contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, a threshold considered safe for most people with gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <h2>What Does "Under 20 ppm Gluten" Mean?</h2>

    <p>The term "under 20 ppm gluten" refers to the amount of gluten present in a product. Parts per million (ppm) is a measurement used to indicate the concentration of gluten. For a product to be labeled as gluten-free in many countries, including the United States and the European Union, it must contain less than 20 ppm of gluten. This threshold is based on scientific research showing that most people with celiac disease can tolerate this level without adverse effects.</p>

    <p>It’s important to note that "gluten-free" and "gluten-reduced" are not the same. Gluten-free beers are made without any gluten-containing ingredients, while gluten-reduced beers are made with gluten-containing grains but are treated to reduce the gluten content to below 20 ppm. Both types can be safe for those with gluten sensitivities, but individuals with celiac disease should consult their healthcare provider before consuming gluten-reduced beers.</p>

    <h2>Popular Beers Under 20 ppm Gluten</h2>

    <p>Here’s a list of some popular beers that are either gluten-free or gluten-reduced, ensuring they contain less than 20 ppm of gluten:</p>

    <h2>How Are Gluten-Reduced Beers Made?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-reduced beers are typically made using traditional brewing methods with gluten-containing grains like barley or wheat. However, after the brewing process, the beer is treated with enzymes that break down the gluten proteins into smaller fragments. These fragments are then filtered out, reducing the gluten content to below 20 ppm. It’s important to note that while these beers are safe for many people with gluten sensitivities, they may not be suitable for everyone with celiac disease, as the enzyme treatment does not remove all gluten.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, gluten-free beers are made without any gluten-containing ingredients. Instead, they use alternative grains like sorghum, millet, rice, or corn. These beers are naturally free of gluten and are safe for those with celiac disease.</p>
