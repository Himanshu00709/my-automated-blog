    <h1>Gluten-Free Mexican Beer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>When it comes to beer, Mexico is renowned for its rich brewing traditions and iconic brands like Corona, Modelo, and Dos Equis. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a traditional Mexican beer can be a challenge. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free beer options has made it possible for everyone to savor the flavors of Mexico without compromising their health. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free Mexican beer, its history, popular brands, and how it’s made.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free beer is brewed without the use of gluten-containing grains like barley, wheat, or rye. Instead, it uses alternative grains such as sorghum, rice, corn, or millet. These grains provide the necessary sugars for fermentation while ensuring the final product is safe for those with gluten intolerance. The process of making gluten-free beer is similar to traditional brewing, but it requires careful attention to avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

    <h2>The Rise of Gluten-Free Mexican Beer</h2>
    <p>Mexico’s beer culture is deeply rooted in its history, with brewing traditions dating back to the Spanish colonial era. However, the demand for gluten-free options has grown significantly in recent years, driven by increased awareness of gluten-related health issues. Mexican breweries have responded by developing gluten-free beers that cater to this growing market. These beers often incorporate traditional Mexican flavors, such as lime and agave, to create a unique drinking experience.</p>

    <h2>How Gluten-Free Mexican Beer is Made</h2>
    <p>The brewing process for gluten-free beer is similar to traditional beer production, but with a few key differences. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Selection of Gluten-Free Grains:</strong> Brewers choose grains like sorghum, rice, corn, or millet as the base for the beer. These grains are naturally gluten-free and provide the necessary sugars for fermentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Mashing:</strong> The grains are mixed with water and heated to extract fermentable sugars. This process is known as mashing.</li>
        <li><strong>Boiling and Hopping:</strong> The liquid, known as wort, is boiled and hops are added for flavor and aroma. Hops are naturally gluten-free, so they are safe for use in gluten-free beer.</li>
        <li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> The wort is cooled and yeast is added to begin fermentation. The yeast consumes the sugars, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide.</li>
        <li><strong>Filtration and Packaging:</strong> After fermentation, the beer is filtered to remove any remaining solids and then packaged. Brewers take extra care to avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing ingredients during this stage.</li>
    </ol>
