    <h1>Gluten Reduced Beer Near Me: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For beer enthusiasts with gluten sensitivities, finding a beer that doesn’t compromise on taste while being safe to consume can be a challenge. Gluten-reduced beer has emerged as a popular alternative, offering a solution for those who want to enjoy a cold brew without the adverse effects of gluten. In this article, we’ll explore what gluten-reduced beer is, how it’s made, where to find it, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Reduced Beer?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-reduced beer is a type of beer that has been treated to reduce its gluten content to a level that is generally considered safe for most people with gluten sensitivities. Unlike gluten-free beer, which is made from grains that are naturally free of gluten (such as sorghum, rice, or millet), gluten-reduced beer is typically made from barley or wheat, which contain gluten. The gluten is then broken down using enzymes during the brewing process, reducing it to a level that is usually below 20 parts per million (ppm), the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>How is Gluten-Reduced Beer Made?</h2>
    <p>The process of making gluten-reduced beer involves the use of enzymes that break down the gluten proteins into smaller fragments. These fragments are small enough that they do not trigger an immune response in most people with gluten sensitivities. The enzymes are typically added during the fermentation process, and the beer is then tested to ensure that the gluten content is below the 20 ppm threshold.</p>
