    <h1>Best Rated Gluten-Free Beers: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, enjoying a cold beer can be a challenge. Traditional beers are made from barley, wheat, or rye, all of which contain gluten. However, the growing demand for gluten-free products has led to the development of a variety of gluten-free beers that cater to those with dietary restrictions. In this article, we will explore some of the best-rated gluten-free beers available today, their unique characteristics, and what makes them stand out in the market.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Beer Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free beers are brewed using alternative grains such as sorghum, rice, millet, or corn, which do not contain gluten. Some breweries also use enzymes to break down gluten proteins in traditional grains, making the beer safe for those with gluten intolerance. It's important to note that not all gluten-free beers are created equal, and the taste, texture, and quality can vary significantly between brands.</p>
