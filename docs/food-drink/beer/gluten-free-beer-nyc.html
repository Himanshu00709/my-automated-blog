    <h1>Gluten-Free Beer in NYC: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>New York City, a melting pot of cultures and cuisines, is also a haven for beer enthusiasts. For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a good gluten-free beer can be a challenge. However, NYC’s vibrant craft beer scene has embraced the demand for gluten-free options, offering a variety of brews that cater to this niche. In this guide, we’ll explore the best gluten-free beers available in NYC, where to find them, and what makes them stand out.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free beer is brewed without the use of gluten-containing grains like barley, wheat, or rye. Instead, brewers use alternative grains such as sorghum, rice, millet, or buckwheat. Some breweries also use enzymes to break down gluten in traditional beers, making them safe for those with gluten intolerance. However, it’s important to note that not all gluten-free beers are created equal, and the taste can vary significantly depending on the ingredients and brewing process.</p>
