    <h1>Gluten-Free Beer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For many beer enthusiasts, the idea of giving up beer due to gluten intolerance or celiac disease can be disheartening. However, the rise of gluten-free beer has opened up a world of possibilities for those who need or choose to avoid gluten. In this article, we’ll explore what gluten-free beer is, how it’s made, its benefits, and some of the best options available on the market today.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free beer is a type of beer that is brewed without gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, or rye. Instead, it uses alternative grains like sorghum, rice, millet, or corn. These grains do not contain gluten, making the beer safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Gluten-free beer can also be made by removing gluten from traditional beer through a process called enzymatic treatment, which breaks down the gluten proteins to a level that is considered safe for consumption.</p>

    <h2>How is Gluten-Free Beer Made?</h2>

    <p>The process of making gluten-free beer is similar to that of traditional beer, with a few key differences. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Step</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1. Mashing</td>
                <td>Gluten-free grains like sorghum, rice, or millet are mashed to extract fermentable sugars. This step is crucial as it determines the beer's flavor profile.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2. Boiling</td>
                <td>The mash is boiled, and hops are added for bitterness and aroma. Hops are naturally gluten-free, so they can be used in gluten-free beer without issue.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3. Fermentation</td>
                <td>Yeast is added to the cooled wort to begin fermentation. The yeast consumes the sugars, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4. Conditioning</td>
                <td>The beer is conditioned to allow flavors to mature and any remaining yeast to settle out.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5. Packaging</td>
                <td>The beer is filtered, carbonated, and packaged into bottles, cans, or kegs.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
