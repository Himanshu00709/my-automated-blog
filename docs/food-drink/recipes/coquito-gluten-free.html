    <h1>Coquito Gluten-Free: A Delicious Holiday Treat</h1>
    <p>Coquito, often referred to as "Puerto Rican eggnog," is a creamy, coconut-based holiday drink that has been a staple in Puerto Rican households for generations. Traditionally made with ingredients like coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and rum, coquito is a festive beverage that brings warmth and joy to holiday celebrations. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, the good news is that coquito is naturally gluten-free, making it a safe and delicious option for everyone to enjoy.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Coquito Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Coquito is inherently gluten-free because its primary ingredients—coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg—do not contain gluten. However, it's essential to ensure that any additional ingredients or garnishes you use are also gluten-free. For example, some brands of rum may contain additives or flavorings that could introduce gluten, so it's crucial to check the labels or opt for a certified gluten-free rum.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Coquito</h2>
    <p>While coquito is undoubtedly a treat, it does offer some health benefits, especially when made with high-quality, natural ingredients. Coconut milk, the base of coquito, is rich in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are known to support metabolism and provide a quick source of energy. Additionally, coconut milk contains lauric acid, which has antimicrobial and antiviral properties. The spices used in coquito, such as cinnamon and nutmeg, are also packed with antioxidants and have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
