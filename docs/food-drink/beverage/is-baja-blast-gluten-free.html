<h1>Is Baja Blast Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For those who are gluten-sensitive or have celiac disease, navigating the world of beverages can be a daunting task. One popular drink that often comes under scrutiny is Mountain Dew's Baja Blast. Known for its unique tropical lime flavor, Baja Blast has garnered a massive following. But the question remains: Is Baja Blast gluten-free? In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and other factors to determine whether Baja Blast is safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Implications</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it's crucial for these individuals to ensure that the foods and beverages they consume are free from gluten.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Baja Blast</h2>

<p>To determine whether Baja Blast is gluten-free, we first need to examine its ingredients. The primary ingredients in Baja Blast include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Carbonated Water</li>
    <li>High Fructose Corn Syrup</li>
    <li>Concentrated Orange Juice</li>
    <li>Citric Acid</li>
    <li>Natural Flavors</li>
    <li>Sodium Benzoate</li>
    <li>Caffeine</li>
    <li>Sodium Citrate</li>
    <li>Erythorbic Acid</li>
    <li>Calcium Disodium EDTA</li>
    <li>Yellow 5</li>
    <li>Brominated Vegetable Oil</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it's essential to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process.</p>

<h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination</h2>

<p>Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free products are processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing ingredients. This can happen through shared equipment or airborne particles. To assess the risk of cross-contamination with Baja Blast, we need to look at the manufacturing practices of PepsiCo, the parent company of Mountain Dew.</p>

<p>PepsiCo has a stringent quality control process in place to prevent cross-contamination. However, they do not explicitly label Baja Blast as gluten-free. This lack of certification can be a concern for those with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Information and Allergen Statements</h2>

<p>PepsiCo provides detailed nutritional information and allergen statements for their products. According to their official statements, Baja Blast does not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, they also state that they cannot guarantee that their products are entirely free from gluten due to the potential for cross-contamination.</p>
