    <h1>Is Humm Kombucha Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Kombucha has become a popular beverage choice for health-conscious individuals, and Humm Kombucha is one of the leading brands in the market. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Is Humm Kombucha gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, brewing process, and certifications to provide a comprehensive answer.</p>

    <h2>What is Kombucha?</h2>
    <p>Kombucha is a fermented tea beverage made by combining tea, sugar, and a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY). The fermentation process produces probiotics, organic acids, and a small amount of alcohol, making it a popular choice for gut health and overall wellness.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Gluten Sensitivity</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems. Therefore, it’s crucial to know whether a product like Humm Kombucha is safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>
