    <h1>Is Mountain Dew Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Mountain Dew is one of the most popular carbonated soft drinks in the world, known for its bold citrus flavor and high caffeine content. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, the question of whether Mountain Dew is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of Mountain Dew, explore its gluten-free status, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to ensure that the foods and beverages they consume are free from gluten.</p>

    <h2>Mountain Dew Ingredients: A Closer Look</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Mountain Dew is gluten-free, we need to examine its ingredients. The primary ingredients in Mountain Dew include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Carbonated water</li>
        <li>High fructose corn syrup</li>
        <li>Concentrated orange juice</li>
        <li>Citric acid</li>
        <li>Natural flavors</li>
        <li>Sodium benzoate (preservative)</li>
        <li>Caffeine</li>
        <li>Sodium citrate</li>
        <li>Erythorbic acid (preservative)</li>
        <li>Gum arabic</li>
        <li>Calcium disodium EDTA (to protect flavor)</li>
        <li>Brominated vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Yellow 5</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it's important to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process, as well as the source of some ingredients like natural flavors, which can sometimes be derived from gluten-containing grains.</p>

    <h2>Is Mountain Dew Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>According to the manufacturer, PepsiCo, Mountain Dew is considered gluten-free. The company states that their products are formulated to be free from gluten-containing ingredients. However, it's important to note that PepsiCo does not test for gluten in their finished products, and they do not label their products as "certified gluten-free."</p>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, this lack of certification may be a cause for concern. While the ingredients themselves do not contain gluten, the risk of cross-contamination cannot be entirely ruled out. Therefore, it is always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional if you have any doubts.</p>
