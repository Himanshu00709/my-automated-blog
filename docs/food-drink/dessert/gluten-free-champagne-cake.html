    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free champagne cake:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Incorporate Dry Ingredients and Champagne</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the champagne. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Adjust Consistency with Milk</h3>
    <p>If the batter seems too thick, add the milk a little at a time until you reach the desired consistency. The batter should be smooth and pourable.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Frost</h3>
    <p>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, frost with your favorite gluten-free frosting and decorate as desired.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Champagne Cake?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free champagne cake is more than just a dessert; it’s a statement. It’s perfect for those who want to enjoy a luxurious treat without compromising their dietary needs. The champagne adds a touch of elegance, making it ideal for weddings, anniversaries, or any special occasion. Plus, with the right gluten-free flour blend, you won’t even miss the gluten!</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a non-dairy milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. If you’ve frosted the cake, make sure the frosting is suitable for refrigeration.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the cake?</h3>
