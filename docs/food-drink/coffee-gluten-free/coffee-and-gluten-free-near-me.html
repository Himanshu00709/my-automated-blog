    <h1>Coffee and Gluten-Free Near Me: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For coffee enthusiasts with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a café that offers both high-quality coffee and gluten-free options can be a challenge.

While coffee itself is naturally gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur in cafés where gluten-containing foods are prepared. Additionally, many coffee additives, such as flavored syrups or baked goods, may contain gluten. Therefore, it’s essential to choose a café that understands and accommodates gluten-free needs.</p>
