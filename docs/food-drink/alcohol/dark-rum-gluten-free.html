    <h1>Is Dark Rum Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Dark rum is a beloved spirit known for its rich, complex flavors and versatility in cocktails. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether dark rum is gluten-free is a critical one. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten content in dark rum, how it’s made, and what you need to know to enjoy it safely.</p>

    <h2>What is Dark Rum?</h2>
    <p>Dark rum is a type of rum that is aged longer than light or white rum, giving it a deeper color and more robust flavor profile. It is typically made from sugarcane byproducts like molasses or sugarcane juice, which are fermented and then distilled. The aging process in charred oak barrels contributes to its dark hue and complex taste, often featuring notes of caramel, vanilla, and spices.</p>

    <h2>Is Dark Rum Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>The good news for rum enthusiasts is that dark rum is generally considered gluten-free. This is because the distillation process removes gluten proteins from the final product. However, there are some important considerations to keep in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Dark rum is typically made from gluten-free ingredients like molasses or sugarcane juice. However, some flavored rums or spiced rums may contain additives that could introduce gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> While the distillation process eliminates gluten, cross-contamination can occur during production or bottling if the facility also processes gluten-containing products.</li>
        <li><strong>Certification:</strong> For those with severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, it’s advisable to look for rums that are certified gluten-free by a reputable organization.</li>
    </ul>
