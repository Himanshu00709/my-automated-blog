<h1>Is Mulled Wine Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>Mulled wine, a traditional winter beverage, is a favorite for many during the holiday season. Its warm, spiced aroma and rich flavors make it a comforting drink for cold evenings. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Is mulled wine gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we will explore the ingredients of mulled wine, potential sources of gluten, and how to ensure your mulled wine is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What is Mulled Wine?</h2>

<p>Mulled wine is a heated beverage made by simmering red wine with a variety of spices, fruits, and sweeteners. Common ingredients include cinnamon sticks, cloves, star anise, orange slices, and sugar or honey. The mixture is gently heated to infuse the flavors, creating a warm and aromatic drink that is often enjoyed during the winter months.</p>

<p>While the base of mulled wine is typically red wine, the additional ingredients can vary depending on regional traditions and personal preferences. This variability is important to consider when determining whether mulled wine is gluten-free.</p>
