    <h1>Is Tequila Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Tequila, the iconic Mexican spirit, has gained worldwide popularity for its unique flavor and versatility in cocktails. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether tequila is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the production process of tequila, explore its gluten-free status, and provide answers to frequently asked questions about tequila and gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Tequila?</h2>
    <p>Tequila is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from the blue agave plant, primarily in the region surrounding the city of Tequila in Mexico. The production process involves harvesting the agave plant, extracting its core (called the piña), fermenting the sugars, and distilling the liquid to create the final product. Tequila is classified into several categories, including Blanco (unaged), Reposado (aged 2-12 months), Añejo (aged 1-3 years), and Extra Añejo (aged over 3 years).</p>

    <h2>Is Tequila Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>The short answer is yes, pure tequila made from 100% blue agave is gluten-free. Gluten is a protein found in grains like wheat, barley, and rye, and since tequila is made from agave, it does not contain gluten. However, there are some important considerations to keep in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>100% Agave Tequila:</strong> This type of tequila is made exclusively from blue agave and is naturally gluten-free. Always check the label to ensure it says "100% agave."</li>
        <li><strong>Mixto Tequila:</strong> Some tequilas, known as "mixto," are made with a combination of agave and other sugars, which may include gluten-containing grains. These are not considered gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavored Tequilas:</strong> Flavored or infused tequilas may contain additives or flavorings that introduce gluten. Always verify the ingredients before consuming.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How is Tequila Made?</h2>
