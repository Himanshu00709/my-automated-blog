            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2. Fermentation</td>
                <td>The grape juice is fermented into wine, which is then distilled twice in copper pot stills.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3. Distillation</td>
                <td>The wine is distilled to produce a clear, high-alcohol spirit known as "eau-de-vie."</td>

    <h2>Is Cognac Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>The good news for gluten-sensitive individuals is that cognac is generally considered gluten-free. Here’s why:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Grape-Based:</strong> Cognac is made from grapes, which are naturally gluten-free. The fermentation and distillation processes further eliminate any potential gluten contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Distillation Process:</strong> Distillation removes proteins, including gluten, from the final product. This makes distilled spirits like cognac safe for most people with gluten sensitivities.</li>
        <li><strong>No Gluten-Containing Additives:</strong> Authentic cognac does not contain additives or flavorings that might introduce gluten.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, it’s important to note that cross-contamination can occur during production or bottling, especially if the facility also processes gluten-containing products. Always check with the manufacturer if you have severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>
