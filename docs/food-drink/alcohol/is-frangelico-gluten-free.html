    <h1>Is Frangelico Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Frangelico, the iconic hazelnut liqueur, has been a favorite among cocktail enthusiasts and dessert lovers for decades. Its rich, nutty flavor makes it a versatile ingredient in both drinks and culinary creations. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Frangelico is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we’ll delve into the ingredients, production process, and gluten content of Frangelico to provide a clear answer to this question.</p>

    <h2>What is Frangelico?</h2>

    <p>Frangelico is an Italian liqueur made from hazelnuts, cocoa, vanilla, and other natural flavors. It has a distinctively sweet and nutty taste, making it a popular choice for cocktails, desserts, and even coffee. The liqueur is named after a hermit monk, Fra Angelico, who is said to have created the original recipe. Frangelico is often enjoyed on its own, over ice, or as a key ingredient in cocktails like the Nutty Irishman or the Frangelico Sour.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions. Therefore, it’s crucial to understand whether a product like Frangelico contains gluten or is processed in a way that could lead to cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Is Frangelico Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>According to the manufacturer, Frangelico is gluten-free. The primary ingredients in Frangelico—hazelnuts, cocoa, and vanilla—are naturally gluten-free. Additionally, the distillation process used to produce the liqueur typically removes gluten proteins, making it safe for most people with gluten sensitivities. However, it’s always a good idea to check the label or contact the manufacturer if you have severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients in Frangelico</h3>
