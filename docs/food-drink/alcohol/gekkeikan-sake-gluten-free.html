    <h1>Gekkeikan Sake: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

    <p>When it comes to traditional Japanese beverages, sake holds a special place in the hearts of many. Among the myriad of sake brands available, Gekkeikan stands out as one of the most renowned and respected names in the industry. But what makes Gekkeikan sake even more appealing to a broader audience is its gluten-free nature. In this article, we will delve into the world of Gekkeikan sake, exploring its gluten-free qualities, production process, and why it’s a great choice for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <h2>What is Gekkeikan Sake?</h2>

    <p>Gekkeikan is one of the oldest and most prestigious sake breweries in Japan, with a history that dates back to 1637. Located in Fushimi, Kyoto, Gekkeikan has been producing high-quality sake for over 380 years. The name "Gekkeikan" translates to "Laurel Wreath," symbolizing the company's commitment to excellence and tradition.</p>

    <p>Gekkeikan sake is made from four primary ingredients: rice, water, yeast, and koji mold. The brewing process is meticulous, involving multiple steps such as polishing the rice, fermenting the mixture, and aging the sake. The result is a smooth, flavorful beverage that can be enjoyed on its own or paired with a variety of dishes.</p>

    <h2>Is Gekkeikan Sake Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, Gekkeikan sake is gluten-free. Unlike beer, which is typically made from barley and contains gluten, sake is made from rice, which is naturally gluten-free. The brewing process of sake does not introduce any gluten-containing ingredients, making it a safe choice for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <p>However, it’s important to note that while sake itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur if the sake is produced in a facility that also handles gluten-containing products. Gekkeikan takes great care to prevent cross-contamination, ensuring that their sake remains gluten-free from start to finish.</p>

    <h2>The Brewing Process of Gekkeikan Sake</h2>

    <p>The brewing process of Gekkeikan sake is a blend of tradition and modern technology. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how this gluten-free sake is made:</p>

        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1. Rice Polishing</td>
                <td>The outer layers of the rice grains are polished away to remove impurities and reveal the starchy core. The degree of polishing affects the sake's flavor and quality.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2. Washing and Soaking</td>
                <td>The polished rice is washed and soaked to prepare it for steaming. This step ensures that the rice absorbs the right amount of water.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3. Steaming</td>

                <td>4. Koji Production</td>
