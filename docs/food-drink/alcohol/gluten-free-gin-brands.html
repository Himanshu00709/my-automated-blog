    <h1>Gluten-Free Gin Brands: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gin, a beloved spirit with a rich history, has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying gin can be a bit of a challenge. The good news is that there are several gluten-free gin brands available that allow everyone to enjoy this classic spirit without worry. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free gin, discuss what makes a gin gluten-free, and highlight some of the best brands on the market.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Gin Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gin is typically made from a base spirit that is distilled from grains such as wheat, barley, or rye. These grains contain gluten, which can be problematic for individuals with gluten sensitivities. However, during the distillation process, the gluten protein is removed, making the final product gluten-free. It’s important to note that while most gins are technically gluten-free due to the distillation process, some brands may add flavorings or other ingredients after distillation that could contain gluten. Therefore, it’s crucial to choose brands that are certified gluten-free or explicitly state that they are safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>
