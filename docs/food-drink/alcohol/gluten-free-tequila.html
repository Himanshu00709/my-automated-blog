    <h1>Gluten-Free Tequila: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Tequila, the iconic Mexican spirit, has long been celebrated for its rich history, unique flavor profiles, and versatility in cocktails. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether tequila is gluten-free is a critical one. The good news? Authentic tequila is naturally gluten-free, making it a safe and enjoyable option for those avoiding gluten. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the world of gluten-free tequila, exploring its production process, types, and how to choose the best options for your needs.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Tequila Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Tequila is made from the blue agave plant, which is naturally gluten-free. Unlike spirits derived from grains like wheat, barley, or rye, tequila’s primary ingredient contains no gluten proteins. The production process involves harvesting the agave plant, extracting its sugars, fermenting them, and then distilling the liquid. Distillation is a key factor in ensuring that any potential gluten contaminants are removed, as gluten proteins do not vaporize and are left behind during the process.</p>

    <h2>Types of Gluten-Free Tequila</h2>
    <p>Tequila comes in several varieties, each with its own distinct characteristics. Here’s a breakdown of the main types:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Type</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Aging Period</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
