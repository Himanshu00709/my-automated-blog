<h1>Best Gluten-Free Vodka: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding gluten-free alcoholic beverages can be a challenge. Vodka, a popular spirit, is traditionally made from grains like wheat, rye, or barley, which contain gluten. However, there are now many gluten-free vodka options available that are safe for those avoiding gluten. In this guide, we’ll explore the best gluten-free vodkas, how they’re made, and what to look for when choosing one.</p>

<h2>What Makes Vodka Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Vodka is typically distilled from grains, but the distillation process removes most of the gluten proteins. However, some people with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease may still react to trace amounts of gluten. To be considered truly gluten-free, vodka must be made from gluten-free ingredients such as potatoes, corn, grapes, or other non-grain sources. Additionally, the production process must avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing products.</p>
