<h1>Gluten-Free Vodka: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding gluten-free alcoholic beverages can be a challenge. Vodka, a popular spirit, is often made from grains like wheat, barley, or rye, which contain gluten. However, there are many gluten-free vodka options available that are safe for those who need to avoid gluten. In this article, we will explore the world of gluten-free vodka, including what makes vodka gluten-free, a list of popular gluten-free vodka brands, and answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

<h2>What Makes Vodka Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Vodka is typically distilled from grains, but the distillation process removes most of the gluten proteins. However, some people with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity may still react to trace amounts of gluten that remain in the final product. To ensure a vodka is truly gluten-free, it should be made from gluten-free ingredients such as potatoes, corn, grapes, or other non-grain sources. Additionally, some brands use a gluten-free certification process to guarantee their products are safe for those with gluten intolerance.</p>
