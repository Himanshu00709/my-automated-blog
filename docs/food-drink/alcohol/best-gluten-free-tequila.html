    <h1>Best Gluten-Free Tequila: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Tequila, the iconic Mexican spirit, has gained immense popularity worldwide. For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free tequila is essential. The good news is that most tequilas are naturally gluten-free, as they are made from the blue agave plant, not grains. However, it's crucial to understand the production process and choose brands that adhere to strict gluten-free standards. In this guide, we’ll explore the best gluten-free tequilas, how they’re made, and what to look for when selecting a bottle.</p>

Always look for certifications or labels that confirm the absence of gluten.</p>
