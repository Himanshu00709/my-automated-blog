    <h1>Does Bacardi Contain Gluten? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, understanding whether alcoholic beverages contain gluten is crucial. Bacardi, one of the most popular rum brands globally, often comes under scrutiny for its gluten content. In this article, we will explore whether Bacardi contains gluten, how it is produced, and what you need to know if you're following a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Does It Matter?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and long-term complications like intestinal damage. Even trace amounts of gluten can trigger symptoms, making it essential to carefully scrutinize food and beverage labels.</p>

    <h2>How is Bacardi Made?</h2>

    <p>Bacardi is a type of rum, which is distilled from sugarcane byproducts such as molasses or sugarcane juice. The distillation process involves fermenting these byproducts, distilling the liquid, and then aging it in barrels. The key point here is that rum, including Bacardi, is typically made from sugarcane, not grains like wheat or barley, which are the primary sources of gluten.</p>

    <h2>Does Bacardi Contain Gluten?</h2>

    <p>According to Bacardi's official statements and independent testing, Bacardi rum is gluten-free. The distillation process used to produce Bacardi removes gluten proteins, even if the original ingredients contained trace amounts. However, it's important to note that while the distillation process eliminates gluten, cross-contamination can occur during production or bottling. Bacardi has stated that they take precautions to prevent cross-contamination, making their products safe for most people with gluten sensitivities.</p>
