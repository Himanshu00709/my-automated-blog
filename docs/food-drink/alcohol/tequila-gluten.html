    <h1>Tequila and Gluten: What You Need to Know</h1>
    <p>Tequila, a beloved spirit originating from Mexico, has gained global popularity for its unique flavor profile and versatility in cocktails. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, understanding whether tequila contains gluten is crucial. This article delves into the relationship between tequila and gluten, providing a comprehensive guide for those who need to navigate this aspect of their diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Tequila Made From?</h2>
    <p>Tequila is distilled from the blue agave plant, specifically the heart of the plant, known as the piña. The production process involves harvesting the piñas, cooking them to extract fermentable sugars, fermenting the sugars, and then distilling the resulting liquid. Unlike other spirits such as whiskey or beer, which are made from gluten-containing grains like barley, wheat, or rye, tequila is inherently gluten-free due to its agave base.</p>

    <h2>Is Tequila Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Yes, pure tequila made from 100% blue agave is gluten-free. The distillation process removes any potential gluten proteins, making it safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it's important to note that some tequilas may contain additives or flavorings that could introduce gluten. Always check the label or contact the manufacturer to ensure the product is gluten-free.</p>

    <h3>Types of Tequila and Gluten Content</h3>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Type of Tequila</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free?</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>100% Blue Agave Tequila</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
                <td>Made exclusively from blue agave, no gluten-containing ingredients.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mixto Tequila</td>
                <td>Usually</td>
                <td>Contains at least 51% blue agave; the remaining 49% can include other sugars, but gluten is typically not present.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Flavored Tequila</td>
                <td>Depends</td>
                <td>Check for additives or flavorings that may contain gluten.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>How to Ensure Your Tequila is Gluten-Free</h2>
    <p>To ensure that the tequila you consume is gluten-free, follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check the Label:</strong> Look for tequilas labeled as "100% Blue Agave." These are the safest options for those avoiding gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Research the Brand:</strong> Some brands may use additives or flavorings that contain gluten. Research the brand or contact the manufacturer for clarification.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Mixto Tequilas:</strong> While most mixto tequilas are gluten-free, they are not as reliable as 100% blue agave tequilas.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Cautious with Flavored Tequilas:</strong> Flavored tequilas may contain gluten-containing additives. Always verify the ingredients before consuming.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Misconceptions About Tequila and Gluten</h2>
    <p>There are several misconceptions surrounding tequila and gluten. One common myth is that all alcoholic beverages contain gluten. While many spirits are made from gluten-containing grains, tequila is an exception due to its agave base. Another misconception is that the distillation process does not remove gluten. In reality, distillation effectively removes gluten proteins, making the final product safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Tequila and Gluten</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can people with celiac disease drink tequila?</h3>
        <p>Yes, people with celiac disease can safely drink 100% blue agave tequila, as it is gluten-free. However, they should avoid flavored tequilas or those with unknown additives.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Is there a risk of cross-contamination in tequila production?</h3>
        <p>Cross-contamination is rare in tequila production, especially in facilities that exclusively produce tequila. However, if the facility also produces gluten-containing spirits, there may be a risk. Always check with the manufacturer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Are all tequilas labeled as "gluten-free"?</h3>
        <p>Not all tequilas are labeled as gluten-free, even if they are. The safest bet is to choose tequilas labeled as "100% Blue Agave," as these are inherently gluten-free.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Tequila, particularly 100% blue agave tequila, is a safe and enjoyable option for individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease. The distillation process ensures that gluten proteins are removed, making it a gluten-free spirit. However, it's essential to be cautious with flavored tequilas or those with additives, as these may introduce gluten. By following the guidelines outlined in this article, you can confidently enjoy tequila without compromising your dietary needs.</p>
