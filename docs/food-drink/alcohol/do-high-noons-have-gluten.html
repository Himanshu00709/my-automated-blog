    <h1>Do High Noons Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the popularity of hard seltzers has skyrocketed, with brands like High Noon leading the charge. These refreshing, low-calorie beverages have become a staple at parties, barbecues, and casual gatherings. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether High Noons contain gluten is of paramount importance. In this article, we’ll delve into the ingredients of High Noon, explore the gluten content, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>What is High Noon?</h2>

    <p>High Noon is a brand of hard seltzer that has gained a reputation for its clean, crisp taste and high-quality ingredients. Unlike many other hard seltzers on the market, High Noon is made with real fruit juice and vodka, rather than malted barley or other gluten-containing grains. This distinction is crucial for those who need to avoid gluten in their diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it’s essential for individuals with these conditions to carefully scrutinize the ingredients of any food or beverage they consume.</p>

    <h2>Do High Noons Contain Gluten?</h2>

    <p>The good news for gluten-sensitive individuals is that High Noon hard seltzers are gluten-free. High Noon is made with vodka, which is typically distilled from grains like wheat or corn. However, the distillation process removes gluten proteins, making the final product safe for those with gluten sensitivities. Additionally, High Noon uses real fruit juice and natural flavors, further ensuring that the product is free from gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients Breakdown</h3>

    <p>Let’s take a closer look at the ingredients in High Noon to understand why it’s considered gluten-free:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Source</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free?</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Vodka</td>
                <td>Distilled from grains (wheat, corn, etc.)</td>
                <td>Yes (gluten removed during distillation)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Real Fruit Juice</td>
                <td>Fruits like black cherry, pineapple, etc.</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Natural Flavors</td>
                <td>Derived from natural sources</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Carbonated Water</td>
                <td>Water with added carbonation</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As you can see, none of the ingredients in High Noon contain gluten, making it a safe choice for those who need to avoid gluten in their diet.</p>

    <h2>Certifications and Labeling</h2>

    <p>While High Noon is made with gluten-free ingredients, it’s important to note that the product is not certified gluten-free by a third-party organization. However, the distillation process used to produce the vodka in High Noon effectively removes gluten proteins, and the brand has stated that their product is gluten-free. For those with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, it’s always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before consuming any product that isn’t certified gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Comparing High Noon to Other Hard Seltzers</h2>

    <p>When it comes to gluten content, not all hard seltzers are created equal. Many hard seltzers on the market are made with malted barley, which contains gluten. This makes them unsuitable for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. High Noon, on the other hand, stands out as a gluten-free option due to its use of vodka and real fruit juice.</p>

                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Truly</td>
                <td>Malted Barley</td>
                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
