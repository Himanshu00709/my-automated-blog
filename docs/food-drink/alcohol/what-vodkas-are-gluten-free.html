<h1>Gluten-Free Vodkas: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding gluten-free alcoholic beverages can be a challenge. Vodka, a popular spirit, is often made from grains like wheat, rye, or barley, which contain gluten. However, there are many gluten-free vodka options available that are safe for those avoiding gluten. In this article, we will explore what makes vodka gluten-free, list some popular gluten-free vodka brands, and answer frequently asked questions about gluten-free vodka.</p>

<h2>What Makes Vodka Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Vodka is traditionally made from grains, but it can also be distilled from other gluten-free ingredients such as potatoes, corn, grapes, or even sugar cane. The distillation process plays a crucial role in determining whether vodka is gluten-free. During distillation, the liquid is heated to create vapor, which is then condensed back into liquid form. This process removes impurities, including gluten proteins, from the final product. However, some experts argue that trace amounts of gluten may still remain, especially if the vodka is made from gluten-containing grains. For this reason, many people with gluten sensitivities prefer vodkas made from naturally gluten-free ingredients.</p>
