    <h1>Gluten-Free Bourbon: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Bourbon, a quintessential American spirit, has long been a favorite among whiskey enthusiasts. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether bourbon is gluten-free is a pressing one. In this article, we will delve into the world of gluten-free bourbon, exploring what makes bourbon gluten-free, popular brands, and how to enjoy it safely.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Bourbon Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Bourbon is traditionally made from a mash bill that includes at least 51% corn, with the remainder typically consisting of barley, rye, or wheat. While barley, rye, and wheat all contain gluten, the distillation process plays a crucial role in determining whether the final product is gluten-free.</p>

    <p>During distillation, the liquid is heated to create vapor, which is then condensed back into liquid form. Gluten proteins are too large to vaporize, meaning they are left behind in the distillation process. As a result, even bourbons made from gluten-containing grains can be considered gluten-free, provided they are properly distilled.</p>

    <h2>Popular Gluten-Free Bourbon Brands</h2>

    <p>While most bourbons are inherently gluten-free due to the distillation process, some brands go the extra mile to ensure their products are safe for those with gluten sensitivities. Below is a table of popular gluten-free bourbon brands:</p>
