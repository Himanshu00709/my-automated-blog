    <h1>Best Gluten-Free Vodkas: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding gluten-free alcoholic beverages can be a challenge. Vodka, a popular spirit, is traditionally made from grains like wheat, rye, or barley, which contain gluten. However, there are many gluten-free vodka options available today, made from alternative ingredients such as potatoes, corn, or grapes.

Therefore, it’s essential to choose vodkas made from naturally gluten-free ingredients. These vodkas are distilled from sources like potatoes, corn, grapes, or even quinoa, ensuring they are safe for gluten-sensitive individuals.</p>
