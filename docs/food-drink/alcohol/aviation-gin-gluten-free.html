    <h1>Aviation Gin: A Gluten-Free Spirit for Discerning Palates</h1>

    <p>In the world of spirits, gin has long been celebrated for its versatility and complex flavor profiles. Among the many brands available, Aviation Gin has carved out a niche for itself as a premium, gluten-free option that appeals to both gin enthusiasts and those with dietary restrictions. Whether you're a seasoned gin drinker or someone exploring gluten-free options, Aviation Gin offers a unique experience that combines tradition with modern craftsmanship.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Aviation Gin Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Aviation Gin is crafted using a meticulous distillation process that ensures it is gluten-free. The primary ingredient in gin is typically grain, which contains gluten. However, during the distillation process, the gluten proteins are removed, leaving behind a spirit that is safe for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Aviation Gin is made from a blend of botanicals, including juniper, lavender, cardamom, and sarsaparilla, which contribute to its distinctive flavor profile.</p>

    <p>It's important to note that while Aviation Gin is gluten-free, individuals with severe gluten allergies should always check with the manufacturer or consult their healthcare provider before consuming any spirit. The distillation process generally removes gluten, but cross-contamination can occur during production or bottling.</p>

    <h2>The Distillation Process: A Closer Look</h2>

    <p>The distillation process is key to understanding why Aviation Gin is gluten-free. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Step</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1. Fermentation</td>
                <td>The base ingredients, typically grains like wheat or barley, are fermented to produce alcohol. This step creates a liquid known as "wash," which contains alcohol and gluten proteins.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2. Distillation</td>
                <td>The wash is heated in a still, causing the alcohol to evaporate. The vapor is then condensed back into liquid form. Gluten proteins, which are larger molecules, do not evaporate and are left behind in the still.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3. Botanicals Infusion</td>
                <td>During or after distillation, botanicals are added to the spirit to impart flavor. Aviation Gin uses a unique blend of botanicals that give it its signature taste.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4. Filtration</td>
                <td>The final product is filtered to remove any remaining impurities, ensuring a smooth and clean finish.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>This process ensures that the final product is free from gluten, making Aviation Gin a safe choice for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <h2>Flavor Profile: What to Expect</h2>

    <p>Aviation Gin is known for its balanced and approachable flavor profile. Unlike some gins that can be overly juniper-forward, Aviation Gin offers a more nuanced taste that appeals to a wide range of palates. Here are some of the key flavor notes you can expect:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Juniper:</strong> The classic gin flavor, providing a piney and slightly citrusy note.</li>
        <li><strong>Lavender:</strong> Adds a floral and slightly sweet aroma.</li>
        <li><strong>Cardamom:</strong> Contributes a warm, spicy undertone.</li>
        <li><strong>Sarsaparilla:</strong> Offers a subtle root beer-like sweetness.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These botanicals come together to create a gin that is both complex and easy to drink, making it an excellent choice for cocktails or sipping neat.</p>
