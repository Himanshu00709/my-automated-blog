    <h1>Gluten-Free Whiskey Bourbon: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Whiskey bourbon has long been a beloved spirit for its rich flavors and deep history. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a glass of bourbon can be a source of concern. The good news is that many whiskeys, including bourbon, are naturally gluten-free. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free whiskey bourbon, how it’s made, what to look for, and some of the best options available on the market today.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Whiskey Bourbon Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Whiskey bourbon is typically made from a mash bill that includes corn, rye, barley, and wheat. While barley and wheat contain gluten, the distillation process removes gluten proteins, making the final product gluten-free. According to the FDA, distilled spirits, including bourbon, are considered gluten-free as long as no gluten-containing ingredients are added after distillation.</p>

    <p>However, it’s important to note that some individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease may still react to trace amounts of gluten. For these individuals, it’s crucial to choose bourbons that are certified gluten-free or made from 100% gluten-free grains like corn or rice.</p>

    <h2>How Bourbon is Made: The Gluten-Free Process</h2>

    <p>The process of making bourbon involves several key steps, each of which plays a role in determining whether the final product is gluten-free:</p>
