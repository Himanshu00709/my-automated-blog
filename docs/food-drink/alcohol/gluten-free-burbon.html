<h1>Gluten-Free Bourbon: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Bourbon, a quintessential American spirit, has long been celebrated for its rich flavors and deep cultural roots. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying bourbon can be a source of concern. The good news is that many bourbons are naturally gluten-free, making it possible for everyone to savor this iconic drink. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free bourbon, including what makes bourbon gluten-free, popular brands, and tips for selecting the right bottle for your needs.</p>

<h2>What Makes Bourbon Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Bourbon is a type of whiskey that is primarily made from corn. According to U.S. regulations, bourbon must be made from at least 51% corn, with the remainder typically consisting of barley, rye, or wheat. The distillation process plays a crucial role in determining whether a bourbon is gluten-free. During distillation, the liquid is heated to create vapor, which is then condensed back into liquid form. This process removes most of the gluten proteins, making the final product safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

<p>However, it’s important to note that not all bourbons are created equal. Some bourbons may contain trace amounts of gluten due to cross-contamination during production or the addition of flavorings after distillation. Therefore, it’s essential to choose bourbons that are certified gluten-free or produced in facilities that adhere to strict gluten-free standards.</p>
