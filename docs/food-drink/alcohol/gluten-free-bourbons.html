<h1>Gluten-Free Bourbons: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Bourbon, America's native spirit, has long been a favorite among whiskey enthusiasts. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying bourbon can be a bit of a gamble. The good news is that many bourbons are naturally gluten-free, making them a safe choice for those avoiding gluten. In this article, we'll explore what makes a bourbon gluten-free, highlight some of the best gluten-free bourbons on the market, and answer some frequently asked questions about gluten-free bourbons.</p>

<h2>What Makes a Bourbon Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Bourbon is a type of whiskey that is primarily made from corn. According to the U.S. government's standards, bourbon must be made from a grain mixture that is at least 51% corn. The remaining grains can include barley, rye, or wheat. While barley, rye, and wheat all contain gluten, the distillation process typically removes gluten proteins, making the final product gluten-free. However, it's important to note that some individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease may still react to trace amounts of gluten that could be present due to cross-contamination during production.</p>

<h2>How to Choose a Gluten-Free Bourbon</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Look for bourbons that are made from a mash bill that is primarily corn. While most bourbons are gluten-free, those with a higher percentage of corn are less likely to contain trace amounts of gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Distillation Process:</strong> The distillation process should effectively remove gluten proteins, but it's always a good idea to check with the distillery if you have severe gluten sensitivities.</li>
    <li><strong>Certifications:</strong> Some bourbons may carry a gluten-free certification, which can provide additional assurance for those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivities.</li>
</ul>
