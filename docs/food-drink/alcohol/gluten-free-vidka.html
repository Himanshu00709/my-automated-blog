    <h1>Gluten-Free Vodka: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Among the many products that have come under scrutiny is vodka, a staple in many cocktails and social gatherings. But is vodka gluten-free? The answer is not as straightforward as you might think. In this article, we will delve into the world of gluten-free vodka, exploring what makes vodka gluten-free, the best brands to try, and how to enjoy it responsibly.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Vodka Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Vodka is traditionally made from grains such as wheat, rye, or barley, all of which contain gluten. However, the distillation process plays a crucial role in determining whether the final product is gluten-free. During distillation, the liquid is heated to create vapor, which is then condensed back into liquid form. This process is believed to remove gluten proteins, making the vodka safe for those with gluten sensitivities. However, some experts argue that trace amounts of gluten may still remain, especially in vodkas made from gluten-containing grains.</p>

    <p>For those who are highly sensitive to gluten or have celiac disease, it is often recommended to opt for vodkas made from gluten-free ingredients such as potatoes, corn, or grapes. These vodkas are naturally gluten-free and are considered safer options.</p>
