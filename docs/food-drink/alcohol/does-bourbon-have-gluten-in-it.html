    <h1>Does Bourbon Have Gluten in It? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Bourbon, a beloved American whiskey, is often a topic of discussion among those who follow a gluten-free diet. Whether you're a bourbon enthusiast or someone with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, understanding whether bourbon contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we'll explore the relationship between bourbon and gluten, how bourbon is made, and what you need to know to enjoy it safely.</p>

    <h2>What is Bourbon?</h2>

    <p>Bourbon is a type of American whiskey that is primarily made from corn. According to U.S. regulations, bourbon must be made from a grain mixture that is at least 51% corn. The remaining grains typically include barley, rye, or wheat. Bourbon is aged in new charred oak barrels, which gives it its distinctive flavor and amber color. The distillation process and aging are key factors that differentiate bourbon from other types of whiskey.</p>

    <h2>Does Bourbon Contain Gluten?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in grains like wheat, barley, and rye. Since bourbon is made from a mixture of grains that often includes barley, it raises the question: does bourbon contain gluten? The answer lies in the distillation process.</p>

    <p>During distillation, the liquid is heated to create vapor, which is then condensed back into liquid form. Gluten proteins are too large to vaporize, so they are left behind in the distillation process. This means that pure distilled bourbon should, in theory, be gluten-free. However, there are some caveats to consider.</p>

    <h3>Potential Sources of Gluten in Bourbon</h3>

    <p>While the distillation process removes gluten, there are a few scenarios where gluten might still be present in bourbon:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Post-Distillation Additives:</strong> Some bourbons may have additives or flavorings added after distillation. If these additives contain gluten, the bourbon may not be gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If the bourbon is produced in a facility that also processes gluten-containing products, there is a risk of cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Barrel Aging:</strong> Some bourbons are aged in barrels that previously held gluten-containing products, such as beer. This could potentially introduce gluten into the bourbon.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Bourbon Brands</h2>

    <p>If you're looking for gluten-free bourbon options, there are several brands that are considered safe for those with gluten sensitivities. Here are a few popular choices:</p>
