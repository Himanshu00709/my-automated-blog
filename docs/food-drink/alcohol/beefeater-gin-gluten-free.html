    <h1>Beefeater Gin: A Gluten-Free Spirit for Gin Enthusiasts</h1>
    <p>Gin has long been a beloved spirit, celebrated for its versatility and complex flavors. Among the many brands available, Beefeater Gin stands out as a classic choice for gin lovers. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Beefeater Gin is gluten-free is a crucial one. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free nature of Beefeater Gin, its distillation process, and why it’s a safe choice for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Beefeater Gin Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Beefeater Gin is crafted using a traditional recipe that includes a blend of botanicals such as juniper berries, coriander seeds, angelica root, and citrus peels. The base spirit used in Beefeater Gin is derived from grains, which typically contain gluten. However, the distillation process plays a key role in making Beefeater Gin gluten-free.</p>
    <p>During distillation, the liquid is heated to a high temperature, causing it to vaporize. The vapor is then condensed back into liquid form. Gluten proteins are too large to vaporize, so they are left behind in the distillation process. As a result, the final distilled spirit is free from gluten proteins, making Beefeater Gin safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <h2>The Distillation Process: Ensuring Gluten-Free Quality</h2>
    <p>Beefeater Gin’s distillation process is a meticulous one, designed to extract the best flavors from its botanicals while ensuring the purity of the spirit. The process involves the following steps:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Step</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1. Mashing</td>
                <td>The grains are mashed to extract fermentable sugars, which are then converted into alcohol during fermentation.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2. Fermentation</td>
                <td>Yeast is added to the mash, converting sugars into alcohol and producing a low-alcohol liquid known as "wash."</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3. Distillation</td>
                <td>The wash is distilled in copper pot stills, separating the alcohol from impurities and gluten proteins.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4. Infusion</td>
                <td>The distilled spirit is infused with botanicals to create the signature flavor profile of Beefeater Gin.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5. Bottling</td>
                <td>The final product is bottled at the desired alcohol strength, ready for consumption.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
