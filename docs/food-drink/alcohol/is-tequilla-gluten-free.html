    <h1>Is Tequila Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Tequila, the iconic Mexican spirit, has gained immense popularity worldwide. Whether sipped neat, mixed into cocktails, or enjoyed as a shot with salt and lime, tequila is a versatile drink. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether tequila is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten content in tequila, how it’s made, and what you need to know to enjoy it safely.</p>

    <h2>What is Tequila?</h2>

    <p>Tequila is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from the blue agave plant, primarily in the region surrounding the city of Tequila in Mexico. The production process involves harvesting the agave plant, extracting its core (piña), fermenting the sugars, and distilling the liquid. The result is a spirit with a unique flavor profile that ranges from earthy and herbal to sweet and citrusy, depending on the aging process.</p>

    <h2>Is Tequila Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The short answer is yes, tequila is generally gluten-free. Since tequila is made from the agave plant, which is naturally gluten-free, the distillation process further removes any potential gluten proteins. However, there are some caveats to consider, especially when it comes to flavored tequilas or additives that may be introduced during production.</p>

    <h3>How Distillation Affects Gluten Content</h3>

    <p>Distillation is a process that separates alcohol from other components in a liquid mixture. During distillation, gluten proteins, which are large molecules, are left behind in the distillation residue. This means that even if a spirit is made from gluten-containing grains (like whiskey or vodka), the final distilled product is typically gluten-free. Since tequila is made from agave, which is gluten-free to begin with, the distillation process ensures that the final product remains gluten-free.</p>

    <h3>Potential Gluten Contamination in Tequila</h3>

    <p>While pure tequila is gluten-free, there are some exceptions to be aware of:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flavored Tequilas:</strong> Some tequilas are infused with flavors or additives that may contain gluten. Always check the label or contact the manufacturer to confirm.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> In facilities that produce both tequila and gluten-containing spirits, there is a risk of cross-contamination. Look for tequilas labeled as "gluten-free" to ensure safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Mixto Tequilas:</strong> Mixto tequilas are made with at least 51% agave and may include other sugars or additives. These additives could potentially contain gluten, so it’s best to stick with 100% agave tequilas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Tequila and Gluten Content</h2>

    <p>Tequila comes in several varieties, each with its own characteristics. Here’s a breakdown of the most common types and their gluten-free status:</p>
