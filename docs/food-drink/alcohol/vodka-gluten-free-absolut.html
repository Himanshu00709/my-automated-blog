Absolut Vodka, a well-known brand, often comes under scrutiny in this regard. In this article, we’ll explore whether Absolut Vodka is gluten-free, how it’s made, and what you need to know if you’re avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>What is Absolut Vodka?</h2>

<p>Absolut Vodka is a Swedish vodka brand that has been around since 1879. It is made from winter wheat and pure water sourced from a deep well in Åhus, Sweden.

<p>Absolut Vodka has also stated that their vodka is gluten-free, and they adhere to strict quality control measures to ensure that their products meet the necessary standards for gluten-free certification.</p>
