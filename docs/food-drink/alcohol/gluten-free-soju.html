In this article, we will delve into the world of gluten-free soju, exploring its production, ingredients, and how it fits into a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>How is Gluten-Free Soju Made?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free soju is typically made using a distillation process that removes gluten proteins from the final product.

The distillation process is key, as it ensures that any gluten present in the raw materials is eliminated, making the final product safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <h3>The Distillation Process</h3>

    <p>Distillation involves heating the fermented liquid to create vapor, which is then cooled and condensed back into a liquid. This process separates the alcohol from the solid components, including gluten proteins. As a result, even if the base ingredient contains gluten, the final distilled product is gluten-free.</p>

        <li><strong>Healthier Option:</strong> Many gluten-free soju brands use natural ingredients like sweet potatoes, which can be a healthier alternative to traditional wheat-based spirits.</li>
    </ul>
