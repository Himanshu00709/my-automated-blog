    <h1>Grand Marnier and Gluten: What You Need to Know</h1>
    <p>Grand Marnier, the iconic French liqueur, is a staple in many bars and kitchens around the world. Known for its rich blend of cognac and bitter orange, it adds a luxurious touch to cocktails and desserts alike. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Grand Marnier contains gluten is a crucial one. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten content of Grand Marnier, its ingredients, and what you need to know to enjoy it safely.</p>

    <h2>What is Grand Marnier?</h2>
