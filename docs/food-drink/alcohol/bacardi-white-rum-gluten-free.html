    <h1>Is Bacardi White Rum Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>When it comes to enjoying a refreshing cocktail, many people are concerned about whether their drink of choice is gluten-free. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, this is a critical consideration. Bacardi White Rum is one of the most popular spirits in the world, but is it safe for those avoiding gluten? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, production process, and gluten-free status of Bacardi White Rum, providing you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>What is Bacardi White Rum?</h2>

    <p>Bacardi White Rum is a light, clear rum that originates from Puerto Rico. It is one of the flagship products of Bacardi Limited, a company with a rich history dating back to 1862. Known for its smooth and versatile flavor profile, Bacardi White Rum is a staple in many classic cocktails, such as the Mojito, Daiquiri, and Piña Colada. But what exactly goes into making this iconic spirit, and is it gluten-free?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients and Production Process</h2>

    <p>Bacardi White Rum is made from molasses, a byproduct of sugar production. The molasses is fermented using yeast, which converts the sugars into alcohol. The resulting liquid is then distilled to increase its alcohol content and remove impurities. Finally, the rum is filtered and aged in oak barrels to develop its flavor before being bottled.</p>

    <p>Here’s a breakdown of the key ingredients and steps involved in the production of Bacardi White Rum:</p>
