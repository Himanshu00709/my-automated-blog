    <h1>Does Soju Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Soju, a traditional Korean distilled spirit, has gained immense popularity worldwide due to its smooth taste and versatility in cocktails. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether soju contains gluten is of paramount importance. This article delves into the ingredients, production process, and gluten content of soju to provide a clear answer to this pressing question.</p>

    <h2>What is Soju?</h2>

    <p>Soju is a clear, colorless distilled beverage that originated in Korea. Traditionally, it is made from rice, but modern production methods often use other starches such as wheat, barley, or sweet potatoes. The alcohol content of soju typically ranges from 16% to 25%, making it stronger than beer or wine but milder than many other spirits.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients and Production Process</h2>

    <p>The primary ingredients in soju are water, starch, and a fermentation starter called nuruk. The starch source can vary, and this is where the potential for gluten comes into play. Traditional soju is made from rice, which is naturally gluten-free. However, some modern soju brands use wheat or barley as the starch source, both of which contain gluten.</p>

    <p>The production process involves fermenting the starch with nuruk, which contains enzymes that break down the starch into sugars. These sugars are then fermented into alcohol. The fermented liquid is distilled to increase the alcohol content and then diluted with water to achieve the desired strength.</p>

    <h2>Does Soju Contain Gluten?</h2>

    <p>The gluten content in soju depends on the ingredients used in its production. Here’s a breakdown:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten Content</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Rice</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Wheat</td>
                <td>Contains Gluten</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Barley</td>
                <td>Contains Gluten</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sweet Potatoes</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As the table illustrates, soju made from rice or sweet potatoes is gluten-free, while soju made from wheat or barley contains gluten. It’s essential to check the label or contact the manufacturer to determine the starch source used in a particular brand of soju.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Soju Brands</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Is all soju gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>No, not all soju is gluten-free. The gluten content depends on the starch source used in production. Soju made from rice or sweet potatoes is gluten-free, while soju made from wheat or barley contains gluten.</p>

        <h3>2. How can I tell if a soju brand is gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Check the label for the ingredients list. If the soju is made from rice or sweet potatoes, it is gluten-free. If the label does not specify, contact the manufacturer for clarification.</p>

        <h3>3. Can people with celiac disease drink soju?</h3>

        <h3>4. Are there any risks of cross-contamination in soju production?</h3>

If you have severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease, it’s best to choose brands that specifically state they are gluten-free and produced in a gluten-free facility.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Soju can be a safe and enjoyable beverage for those avoiding gluten, provided it is made from gluten-free ingredients like rice or sweet potatoes.
