    <h1>Does Soju Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Soju, a traditional Korean alcoholic beverage, has gained immense popularity worldwide due to its smooth taste and versatility. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, the question of whether soju contains gluten is of paramount importance. This article delves into the ingredients, production process, and gluten content of soju, providing a detailed analysis to help you make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>What is Soju?</h2>

    <p>Soju is a clear, colorless distilled spirit that originated in Korea. It is typically made from rice, wheat, barley, or sweet potatoes, and has an alcohol content ranging from 16% to 45%. Soju is often compared to vodka due to its neutral flavor profile, but it is generally sweeter and less potent. The drink is traditionally consumed neat, but it is also a popular base for cocktails.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients and Production Process</h2>

    <p>The primary ingredients used in the production of soju can vary, but they generally include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rice:</strong> Traditionally, soju was made from rice, which is naturally gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Wheat:</strong> Some modern soju brands use wheat as a base ingredient, which contains gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Barley:</strong> Another common ingredient, barley also contains gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweet Potatoes:</strong> A gluten-free alternative used in some soju varieties.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The production process involves fermenting the base ingredient, followed by distillation. The distillation process is crucial because it can remove gluten proteins, making the final product gluten-free even if the base ingredient contains gluten. However, this is not always the case, and cross-contamination can occur during production.</p>

    <h2>Gluten Content in Soju</h2>

    <p>The gluten content in soju largely depends on the ingredients used and the production process. Here’s a breakdown:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten Content</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Rice</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
                <td>Traditional soju made from rice is safe for those with gluten sensitivity.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Wheat</td>
                <td>Contains Gluten</td>
                <td>Soju made from wheat may contain gluten unless thoroughly distilled.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Barley</td>
                <td>Contains Gluten</td>
                <td>Similar to wheat, barley-based soju may contain gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sweet Potatoes</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
                <td>Soju made from sweet potatoes is a safe option for gluten-sensitive individuals.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>It’s important to note that even if the base ingredient contains gluten, the distillation process can remove gluten proteins, making the final product gluten-free. However, cross-contamination during production or the addition of flavorings and additives after distillation can reintroduce gluten.</p>
