<h1>Gluten-Free Hard Cider: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Gluten-free hard cider has become a popular choice for those who are gluten intolerant or simply looking for a refreshing alternative to traditional beers and ales. Made from fermented apples, hard cider is naturally gluten-free, making it a safe and delicious option for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. In this article, we will explore the world of gluten-free hard cider, its benefits, how it's made, and some of the best brands to try.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten-Free Hard Cider?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free hard cider is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermentation of apple juice. Unlike beer, which is typically made from barley, wheat, or rye—all of which contain gluten—hard cider is naturally free from gluten. This makes it an excellent choice for those who need to avoid gluten in their diet. The fermentation process converts the sugars in the apple juice into alcohol, resulting in a beverage that is both refreshing and flavorful.</p>

<h2>How is Gluten-Free Hard Cider Made?</h2>

<p>The process of making gluten-free hard cider begins with the selection of apples. Different varieties of apples can be used to create a range of flavors, from sweet to dry. The apples are crushed to extract the juice, which is then fermented using yeast. The yeast consumes the sugars in the apple juice, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide. The cider is then aged, filtered, and sometimes carbonated before being bottled or canned.</p>

<p>Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the cider-making process:</p>
