    <h1>Gluten-Free Vodka Drinks: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Vodka, a versatile and beloved spirit, has long been a staple in bars and homes worldwide. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying vodka can be a bit of a challenge. Traditional vodka is often made from grains like wheat, barley, or rye, which contain gluten. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free vodka options has made it possible for everyone to enjoy this classic spirit without worry. In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free vodka drinks, from what makes vodka gluten-free to some delicious recipes you can try at home.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Vodka Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Vodka is typically distilled from grains, but the distillation process itself removes most of the gluten proteins. However, for those with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease, even trace amounts of gluten can be problematic. Gluten-free vodka is made from non-gluten-containing ingredients such as potatoes, corn, grapes, or even quinoa. These vodkas are distilled in a way that ensures no gluten contamination, making them safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>
