<h1>Gluten-Free Rums: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply choosing a gluten-free lifestyle, navigating the world of alcoholic beverages can be challenging. Rum, a popular spirit derived from sugarcane, is often a go-to choice for many. But is rum gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free rums, including how they’re made, which brands to trust, and how to enjoy them responsibly.</p>

<h2>What Makes Rum Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Rum is traditionally made from sugarcane byproducts like molasses or directly from sugarcane juice. Since sugarcane is naturally gluten-free, the distillation process of rum typically removes any trace of gluten proteins, making most rums safe for those avoiding gluten. However, it’s essential to be cautious about flavored rums or those with additives, as these may introduce gluten into the product.</p>

<p>The distillation process plays a crucial role in ensuring the final product is gluten-free. During distillation, the liquid is heated, and the alcohol vapors are collected and condensed. Gluten proteins, being large molecules, do not vaporize and are left behind in the distillation process. This means that even if the base ingredient contains gluten, the final distilled product should be gluten-free.</p>

<h2>Popular Gluten-Free Rum Brands</h2>

<p>Here’s a list of some well-known gluten-free rum brands that are safe for those with gluten sensitivities:</p>
