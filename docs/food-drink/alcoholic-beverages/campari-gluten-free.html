<h1>Is Campari Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Campari, the iconic Italian aperitif, is renowned for its vibrant red color and distinctive bitter flavor. It has been a staple in cocktails like the Negroni and Americano for over a century. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Campari is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, production process, and scientific evidence to determine if Campari is safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>What is Campari?</h2>

<p>Campari is a bitter liqueur that originated in Italy in 1860. It is made from a blend of herbs, fruits, and spices, which are macerated in alcohol and water. The exact recipe is a closely guarded secret, but it is known to include ingredients like chinotto (a type of bitter orange) and cascarilla (a type of bark). The result is a complex, slightly sweet, and intensely bitter liqueur that is often enjoyed as an aperitif or used as a key ingredient in cocktails.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Implications</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and production processes of the foods and beverages they consume.</p>

<h2>Is Campari Gluten-Free?</h2>

Additionally, the distillation process used to produce Campari typically removes any gluten proteins that may have been present in the original ingredients. However, it is important to note that Campari is not certified gluten-free, and there is always a risk of cross-contamination during production.</p>
