    <h1>Caramel Vodka: A Gluten-Free Indulgence</h1>
    <p>Caramel vodka is a delightful and versatile spirit that has gained popularity among cocktail enthusiasts and those with dietary restrictions alike. For individuals who follow a gluten-free diet, finding alcoholic beverages that align with their dietary needs can be challenging. Fortunately, caramel vodka offers a delicious solution. In this article, we will explore the world of caramel vodka, its gluten-free nature, and how you can enjoy it in various ways.</p>

    <h2>What is Caramel Vodka?</h2>
    <p>Caramel vodka is a flavored vodka that combines the smoothness of traditional vodka with the rich, sweet taste of caramel.
