<h1>Fernet Gluten Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Fernet, a bitter and aromatic spirit, has been a staple in the world of digestifs for centuries. Originating in Italy, this herbal liqueur has gained global popularity, especially among those who appreciate its complex flavor profile. But for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Is Fernet gluten-free? In this article, we will delve into the details of Fernet, its ingredients, and whether it is safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>What is Fernet?</h2>

<p>Fernet is a type of amaro, a category of Italian herbal liqueurs known for their bitter and complex flavors. It is made by infusing a variety of herbs, spices, and botanicals in a neutral spirit, which is then aged in barrels. The exact recipe for Fernet is often a closely guarded secret, but common ingredients include myrrh, saffron, chamomile, aloe, and rhubarb. The result is a bold, bitter, and slightly sweet liqueur that is typically enjoyed as a digestif after meals.</p>

<p>Fernet has a rich history, with its origins dating back to the early 19th century in Milan, Italy. It was initially used for medicinal purposes, believed to aid digestion and cure various ailments. Over time, it became a popular drink in Italy and eventually spread to other parts of the world, including Argentina, where it is often mixed with cola in a drink known as "Fernet con Coca."</p>
