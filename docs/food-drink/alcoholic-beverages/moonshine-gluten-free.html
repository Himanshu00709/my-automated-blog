    <h1>Moonshine Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Moonshine, often associated with its rebellious history and high-proof potency, has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years. As more people adopt gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, the question arises: Is moonshine gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore the intricacies of moonshine production, its gluten content, and what you need to know to enjoy it safely on a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Moonshine?</h2>

    <p>Moonshine is a high-proof distilled spirit traditionally made from corn, sugar, or other grains. Its name originates from the practice of distilling the spirit illegally under the light of the moon to avoid detection. Today, moonshine is legally produced and widely available, often celebrated for its raw, unaged character and versatility in cocktails.</p>

    <h2>Is Moonshine Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The gluten-free status of moonshine depends on the ingredients used in its production. Traditional moonshine is made from corn, which is naturally gluten-free. However, some moonshines are made from grains like wheat, barley, or rye, which contain gluten. The distillation process removes most proteins, including gluten, but cross-contamination can still occur during production.</p>

    <p>For those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance, it’s crucial to choose moonshine made from 100% gluten-free ingredients and produced in a facility free from cross-contamination. Always check the label or contact the manufacturer to confirm.</p>
