    <h1>Gluten-Free Drinks to Order at a Bar</h1>

    <p>Navigating a bar menu can be challenging for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. While many people are aware of gluten-free food options, gluten-free drinks are often overlooked. However, with a little knowledge, you can enjoy a night out without worrying about gluten. This guide will help you identify gluten-free drinks and make informed choices at the bar.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten in Drinks</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It can be present in various drinks, especially those made from grains. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues. Therefore, it's crucial to know which drinks are safe to consume.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Alcoholic Drinks</h2>

    <p>When it comes to alcoholic beverages, not all are created equal in terms of gluten content. Here’s a breakdown of gluten-free options:</p>

    <h3>1. Gluten-Free Beers</h3>

    <p>Traditional beers are made from barley, which contains gluten. However, many breweries now produce gluten-free beers made from alternative grains like sorghum, rice, or millet. Some popular gluten-free beer brands include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Omission</li>
        <li>Glutenberg</li>
        <li>New Planet</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Ciders</h3>

    <p>Ciders are naturally gluten-free as they are made from fermented apples or other fruits. They are a great alternative to beer and come in a variety of flavors. Popular gluten-free cider brands include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Angry Orchard</li>
        <li>Strongbow</li>
        <li>Woodchuck</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Wines</h3>

    <p>Most wines are gluten-free, as they are made from grapes. However, some winemaking processes may introduce gluten, so it's always best to check with the manufacturer. Generally, red, white, and sparkling wines are safe options.</p>

    <h3>4. Spirits</h3>

    <p>Distilled spirits like vodka, rum, tequila, and gin are typically gluten-free, even if they are made from gluten-containing grains. The distillation process removes gluten proteins. However, flavored spirits may contain gluten, so it's essential to read labels or ask the bartender.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Non-Alcoholic Drinks</h2>

    <p>For those who prefer non-alcoholic beverages, there are plenty of gluten-free options available at most bars:</p>

    <h3>1. Sodas and Soft Drinks</h3>

    <p>Most sodas and soft drinks are gluten-free. However, some flavored sodas or specialty drinks may contain gluten, so it's always a good idea to check the ingredients.</p>

    <h3>2. Juices</h3>

    <p>Freshly squeezed juices and most bottled juices are gluten-free. Be cautious with pre-mixed or flavored juices, as they may contain additives that include gluten.</p>

    <h3>3. Coffee and Tea</h3>

    <p>Plain coffee and tea are naturally gluten-free. However, flavored syrups or creamers may contain gluten, so it's important to ask about the ingredients.</p>
