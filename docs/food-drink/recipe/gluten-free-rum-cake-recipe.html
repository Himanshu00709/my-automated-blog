    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s move on to the step-by-step instructions for making your gluten-free rum cake. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a perfect result.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a bundt pan or a 9-inch round cake pan with butter or gluten-free cooking spray. Dust the pan lightly with gluten-free flour to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes using an electric mixer on medium speed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract. The mixture should be smooth and well-combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined; avoid overmixing to prevent a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Add Rum</h3>
    <p>Fold in the rum gently using a spatula. The batter should be smooth and slightly thick.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, dust with powdered sugar or drizzle with a rum glaze for extra flavor.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Rum Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use any gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend, but make sure it contains xanthan gum or add it separately. Xanthan gum helps mimic the elasticity of gluten, giving your cake a better texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake alcohol-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer an alcohol-free version, you can substitute the rum with rum extract or a combination of apple juice and vanilla extract for a similar flavor profile.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly and refrigerate for up to a week or freeze for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or fruits to the cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add chopped nuts, dried fruits, or even fresh fruits like pineapple to the batter for added texture and flavor. Just make sure to adjust the baking time if needed.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Creating a gluten-free rum cake is easier than you might think, and the results are absolutely worth it. With the right ingredients and a little patience, you can enjoy a moist, flavorful cake that everyone can savor, regardless of dietary restrictions.
