    <h1>Gluten-Free Eggnog Recipe: A Holiday Delight</h1>
    <p>Eggnog is a classic holiday beverage that brings warmth and cheer to any festive gathering. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional eggnog recipes can be a source of concern due to potential cross-contamination or hidden gluten ingredients. Fortunately, making a gluten-free version of this beloved drink is not only possible but also incredibly delicious. In this article, we’ll explore a step-by-step guide to creating a creamy, rich, and safe gluten-free eggnog that everyone can enjoy.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Eggnog?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. While traditional eggnog recipes don’t typically contain gluten, some store-bought versions or additives might include gluten-containing ingredients. By making your own gluten-free eggnog at home, you can ensure that every sip is safe and satisfying.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Egg Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and granulated sugar until the mixture becomes pale and slightly thickened. This process helps to create a smooth and creamy base for your eggnog.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Heat the Milk and Cream</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, combine the whole milk and heavy cream. Heat the mixture over medium heat until it reaches a gentle simmer. Be careful not to let it boil, as this can cause the milk to scorch.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Temper the Eggs</h3>
    <p>Slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly. This step, known as tempering, prevents the eggs from curdling. Once combined, return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring continuously, until it thickens slightly (about 5-7 minutes).</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Flavorings</h3>
    <p>Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract, ground nutmeg, and ground cinnamon. If you’re adding alcohol, such as bourbon or rum, mix it in at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the eggnog to cool to room temperature before transferring it to the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours. When ready to serve, give it a good stir and pour into glasses. Garnish with a sprinkle of nutmeg or cinnamon for an extra festive touch.</p>
