    <h1>Are Angostura Bitters Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Angostura bitters are a staple in many cocktail recipes, adding depth, complexity, and a unique flavor profile to drinks. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, the question of whether Angostura bitters are gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, manufacturing process, and gluten content of Angostura bitters to provide a clear answer to this question.</p>

    <h2>What Are Angostura Bitters?</h2>

    <p>Angostura bitters are a concentrated herbal extract made from a blend of herbs, spices, and botanicals. Originally created in 1824 by Dr. Johann Siegert in the town of Angostura (now Ciudad Bol√≠var, Venezuela), these bitters were initially intended as a medicinal tonic. Over time, they became a popular ingredient in cocktails, particularly in classics like the Old Fashioned and the Manhattan.</p>

    <p>The exact recipe for Angostura bitters is a closely guarded secret, but it is known to contain ingredients such as gentian root, cinnamon, and other botanicals. The bitters are typically used in small quantities, adding a complex flavor to drinks without overwhelming them.</p>

    <h2>Are Angostura Bitters Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, determining whether a product contains gluten is crucial. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. Consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from mild discomfort to severe health issues, in those who are sensitive or intolerant.</p>

    <p>According to the manufacturer, Angostura bitters are gluten-free. The company states that their bitters do not contain any gluten-containing ingredients and are safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it is always important to check the label and consult with the manufacturer if you have any concerns.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients and Manufacturing Process</h2>

    <p>To better understand whether Angostura bitters are gluten-free, let's take a closer look at their ingredients and manufacturing process:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>

                <th>Gluten Content</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Gentian Root</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Cinnamon</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Other Botanicals</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Alcohol Base</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free (Distilled from gluten-free sources)</td>
