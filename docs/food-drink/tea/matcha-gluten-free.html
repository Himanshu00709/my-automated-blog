    <h1>Matcha Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Matcha, the vibrant green tea powder that has taken the world by storm, is not only a delicious beverage but also a powerhouse of health benefits. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, matcha is a fantastic option that aligns with their dietary needs. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free nature of matcha, its health benefits, and how you can incorporate it into your daily routine.</p>

    <h2>What is Matcha?</h2>

    <h2>Is Matcha Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Yes, pure matcha is naturally gluten-free. The tea leaves used to make matcha do not contain gluten, and as long as the matcha is not contaminated during processing or packaging, it remains a safe option for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it is essential to check the label or contact the manufacturer to ensure that the matcha you are purchasing is certified gluten-free, especially if it is a flavored or blended product.</p>
