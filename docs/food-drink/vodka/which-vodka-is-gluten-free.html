<h1>Which Vodka is Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of alcoholic beverages can be a daunting task. Vodka, a popular spirit, is often made from grains like wheat, rye, or barley, which contain gluten. However, not all vodkas are created equal. In this article, we will explore which vodkas are gluten-free, how they are made, and what to look for when choosing a safe option.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten in Vodka</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, skin rashes, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. While traditional vodka is made from gluten-containing grains, the distillation process theoretically removes gluten proteins. However, some individuals may still react to trace amounts, making it essential to choose vodkas that are certified gluten-free or made from non-gluten ingredients.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Vodka Options</h2>

<p>There are several vodka brands that are either made from gluten-free ingredients or are certified gluten-free. Below is a table highlighting some popular gluten-free vodka options:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Brand</th>

<h2>How to Identify Gluten-Free Vodka</h2>
