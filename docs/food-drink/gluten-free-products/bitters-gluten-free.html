    <h1>Bitters Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Bitters have long been a staple in the world of cocktails, adding depth, complexity, and balance to drinks. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether bitters are gluten-free is a crucial one. In this article, we will explore the world of bitters, their ingredients, and whether they are safe for a gluten-free diet. We will also provide tips on how to choose gluten-free bitters and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What Are Bitters?</h2>
    <p>Bitters are concentrated flavor extracts made by infusing herbs, spices, roots, and other botanicals in alcohol. They are typically used in small amounts to enhance the flavor of cocktails, but they can also be used in cooking and even as digestive aids. The alcohol content in bitters is usually high, often around 40-50% ABV, which helps to preserve the flavors and extend the shelf life of the product.</p>

    <h2>Are Bitters Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>The gluten-free status of bitters depends on the ingredients used and the production process. Most bitters are made with a base of high-proof alcohol, which is typically distilled from grains such as wheat, barley, or rye. However, the distillation process removes gluten proteins, making the alcohol itself gluten-free. The concern arises with the additional ingredients, such as flavorings and additives, which may contain gluten.</p>

    <p>It's important to note that not all bitters are created equal. Some brands may use gluten-containing ingredients in their flavorings or may be produced in facilities that also process gluten-containing products, leading to cross-contamination. Therefore, it's essential to read labels carefully and choose bitters that are certified gluten-free if you have a gluten sensitivity or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>How to Choose Gluten-Free Bitters</h2>
    <p>When selecting bitters, there are several factors to consider to ensure they are gluten-free:</p>
