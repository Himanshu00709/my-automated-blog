    <h1>Gluten-Free Malted Milk: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Malted milk has long been a beloved beverage and ingredient in various recipes, known for its rich, creamy, and slightly sweet flavor. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, traditional malted milk can be off-limits due to its gluten content. Enter gluten-free malted milk—a safe and delicious alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this classic treat. In this article, we’ll explore what gluten-free malted milk is, its benefits, how it’s made, and how you can incorporate it into your diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Malted Milk?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free malted milk is a variation of traditional malted milk that is made without gluten-containing ingredients. Traditional malted milk is typically made from malted barley, wheat flour, and whole milk powder. The malted barley provides the distinctive flavor, but it also contains gluten, which can be harmful to those with gluten sensitivities. Gluten-free malted milk replaces barley with gluten-free grains, such as rice, corn, or sorghum, ensuring that the final product is safe for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>How is Gluten-Free Malted Milk Made?</h2>

    <p>The process of making gluten-free malted milk involves several steps, starting with the selection of gluten-free grains. Here’s a breakdown of the process:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Grain Selection:</strong> Gluten-free grains such as rice, corn, or sorghum are chosen as the base for the malted milk. These grains are naturally gluten-free and provide a similar flavor profile to traditional malted barley.</li>
        <li><strong>Malting:</strong> The selected grains are soaked in water and allowed to germinate. This process activates enzymes that break down the starches in the grains into simpler sugars, which are essential for the malting process.</li>
        <li><strong>Drying and Roasting:</strong> After germination, the grains are dried and roasted to develop the characteristic malt flavor. The roasting process also helps to deactivate the enzymes and stabilize the grains.</li>
        <li><strong>Grinding:</strong> The roasted grains are ground into a fine powder, which is then mixed with milk powder and other ingredients to create the final malted milk product.</li>
        <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> The gluten-free malted milk powder is packaged and ready for use in beverages, baking, or other recipes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Incorporating Gluten-Free Malted Milk into Your Diet</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free malted milk can be used in a variety of ways, making it a versatile addition to your kitchen. Here are some ideas for incorporating it into your diet:</p>

        <li><strong>Baking:</strong> Use gluten-free malted milk powder in recipes for cookies, cakes, and bread. It adds a unique flavor and helps to create a tender crumb in baked goods.</li>
