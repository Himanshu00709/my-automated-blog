    <h1>Orgeat: A Gluten-Free Delight for Cocktail Enthusiasts</h1>
    <p>Orgeat syrup, a sweet almond-based syrup, has been a staple in the world of mixology for centuries. Known for its rich, nutty flavor, orgeat is a key ingredient in many classic cocktails, such as the Mai Tai and the Japanese Cocktail. But what makes orgeat particularly appealing to modern consumers is its gluten-free nature. In this article, we’ll explore the origins of orgeat, its gluten-free properties, and how you can incorporate it into your favorite drinks and recipes.</p>

    <h2>What is Orgeat?</h2>
    <p>Orgeat syrup is a sweet syrup made primarily from almonds, sugar, and rose water or orange flower water. Its name comes from the French word "orge," meaning barley, though modern orgeat recipes rarely include barley. Instead, almonds are the star ingredient, giving the syrup its distinctive nutty flavor. Orgeat is often used in cocktails to add depth and complexity, but it can also be used in non-alcoholic beverages, desserts, and even savory dishes.</p>

    <h2>Why is Orgeat Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>One of the key reasons orgeat is gluten-free is that it is made from almonds, which are naturally gluten-free. While traditional orgeat recipes might have included barley, modern versions typically avoid gluten-containing ingredients. This makes orgeat a safe and delicious option for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it’s always important to check the label or recipe to ensure that no gluten-containing ingredients have been added.</p>

    <h2>How to Use Orgeat in Cocktails</h2>
    <p>Orgeat is a versatile ingredient that can elevate a wide range of cocktails. Here are a few classic recipes that showcase the unique flavor of orgeat:</p>

    <h3>1. Mai Tai</h3>
    <p>The Mai Tai is perhaps the most famous cocktail that features orgeat. To make a classic Mai Tai, you’ll need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 oz dark rum</li>
        <li>1 oz lime juice</li>
        <li>0.5 oz orgeat syrup</li>
        <li>0.5 oz orange liqueur</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into a glass filled with crushed ice. Garnish with a mint sprig and a lime wheel.</p>

    <h3>2. Japanese Cocktail</h3>
    <p>The Japanese Cocktail is another classic that highlights the flavor of orgeat. Here’s how to make it:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 oz cognac</li>
        <li>0.5 oz orgeat syrup</li>
        <li>2 dashes Angostura bitters</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Stir all ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with a lemon twist.</p>

    <h2>Orgeat in Non-Alcoholic Beverages</h2>
    <p>Orgeat isn’t just for cocktails—it can also be used to create delicious non-alcoholic drinks. Try adding a splash of orgeat to iced tea, lemonade, or even a latte for a nutty twist. You can also use orgeat to make a refreshing almond milk-based smoothie.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Orgeat</h2>
    <p>While orgeat is primarily known for its flavor, it also offers some nutritional benefits. Almonds are a good source of healthy fats, protein, and vitamin E. However, because orgeat is a sweet syrup, it should be consumed in moderation. Here’s a breakdown of the nutritional content of a typical serving of orgeat:</p>
