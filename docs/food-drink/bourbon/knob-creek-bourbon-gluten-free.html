    <h1>Knob Creek Bourbon: A Gluten-Free Whiskey Experience</h1>

    <p>For bourbon enthusiasts and those with gluten sensitivities, finding a whiskey that is both delicious and safe to consume can be a challenge. Knob Creek Bourbon, a well-known name in the world of premium bourbons, has garnered attention not only for its rich flavor profile but also for its gluten-free status. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free nature of Knob Creek Bourbon, its production process, and why it stands out as a top choice for those seeking a gluten-free whiskey experience.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Knob Creek Bourbon Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Bourbon, by definition, is a type of American whiskey made primarily from corn. The gluten-free status of Knob Creek Bourbon stems from its distillation process. While bourbon is typically made from a mash bill that includes grains like corn, rye, and barley, the distillation process removes gluten proteins, making the final product gluten-free. Knob Creek Bourbon adheres to this process, ensuring that even those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance can enjoy it without concern.</p>

    <p>It’s important to note that while Knob Creek Bourbon is gluten-free, individuals with severe gluten sensitivities should always consult with a healthcare professional before consuming any distilled spirits. Cross-contamination during production or bottling could potentially introduce trace amounts of gluten, although this is rare in large-scale distilleries like Knob Creek.</p>

    <h2>The Distillation Process of Knob Creek Bourbon</h2>

    <p>Knob Creek Bourbon is crafted using a traditional distillation process that has been refined over decades. The bourbon is made from a mash bill that consists of at least 51% corn, along with rye and malted barley. The grains are mashed, fermented, and then distilled in copper stills. The distillation process is key to removing gluten proteins, as the gluten molecules are too large to pass through the distillation process and remain in the spent grains.</p>

    <p>After distillation, the bourbon is aged in new, charred oak barrels for a minimum of nine years. This aging process imparts the rich, complex flavors that Knob Creek is known for, including notes of vanilla, caramel, and oak. The result is a smooth, full-bodied bourbon that is both gluten-free and exceptionally flavorful.</p>

    <h2>Flavor Profile of Knob Creek Bourbon</h2>

    <p>Knob Creek Bourbon is celebrated for its robust and well-balanced flavor profile. Here’s a breakdown of the key tasting notes:</p>

            <tr>
                <td>Oak</td>
