<h1>Don Julio Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>When it comes to premium tequila, Don Julio is a name that stands out. Known for its rich history and exceptional quality, Don Julio has become a favorite among tequila enthusiasts. But for those who are gluten-sensitive or have celiac disease, the question arises: Is Don Julio gluten-free? In this article, we will delve into the details of Don Julio's gluten-free status, its production process, and what makes it a safe choice for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>What Makes Don Julio Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Don Julio tequila is made from 100% blue agave, a plant native to Mexico.

<p>It's important to note that the distillation process further ensures that any potential gluten proteins are removed. Distillation involves heating the liquid to create vapor and then cooling it back into liquid form. This process effectively separates the alcohol from any impurities, including gluten proteins, making the final product safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>
