    <h1>Is All Tequila Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Tequila, the iconic Mexican spirit, has gained immense popularity worldwide. Whether enjoyed neat, in a cocktail, or as part of a margarita, tequila is a favorite for many. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether tequila is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will delve into the details of tequila production, its ingredients, and whether all tequila is safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Tequila Made From?</h2>

    <p>Tequila is a distilled spirit made primarily from the blue agave plant, specifically the <em>Agave tequilana</em> species. The production process involves harvesting the agave plant, extracting its core (known as the piña), and then fermenting and distilling the extracted sugars. The result is a spirit that is typically clear (blanco) or aged in barrels to produce different varieties such as reposado, añejo, and extra añejo.</p>

    <p>Given that tequila is made from agave, which is naturally gluten-free, one might assume that all tequila is safe for those with gluten intolerance. However, the reality is a bit more nuanced, and understanding the production process is key to determining whether a particular tequila is gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Is Tequila Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>In its purest form, tequila is gluten-free. The distillation process removes gluten proteins, making the final product safe for most people with gluten sensitivities. However, there are a few factors to consider:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Additives:</strong> Some tequilas may contain additives or flavorings that could introduce gluten into the product. Always check the label or contact the manufacturer if you are unsure.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> In facilities where tequila is produced alongside other spirits that contain gluten, there is a risk of cross-contamination. This is rare but worth considering if you have severe gluten intolerance.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavored Tequilas:</strong> Flavored tequilas, such as those with added fruit or spice flavors, may contain gluten-containing ingredients. Always verify the ingredients before consuming.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Tequila and Their Gluten-Free Status</h2>

    <p>To better understand whether a particular tequila is gluten-free, it’s helpful to look at the different types of tequila and their production methods. Below is a table summarizing the main types of tequila and their gluten-free status:</p>

    <table>
