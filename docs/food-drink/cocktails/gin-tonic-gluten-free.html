    <h1>Is Gin Tonic Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Gin and tonic is a classic cocktail enjoyed by many around the world. Its refreshing taste and versatility make it a favorite at bars, parties, and even quiet evenings at home. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether gin and tonic is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the world of gin and tonic, exploring its ingredients, production process, and whether it’s safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Gin?</h2>
    <p>Gin is a distilled alcoholic beverage that derives its predominant flavor from juniper berries. It is typically made by distilling fermented grains such as wheat, barley, or rye, which are then infused with botanicals like juniper, coriander, citrus peel, and other herbs and spices. The distillation process is key to understanding whether gin is gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Is Gin Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>The gluten content in gin depends on the distillation process. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. During distillation, the gluten protein is removed because it does not vaporize. This means that even if gin is made from gluten-containing grains, the final product should be gluten-free. However, cross-contamination can occur during production or bottling, so it’s essential to choose brands that certify their products as gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>What is Tonic Water?</h2>
    <p>Tonic water is a carbonated soft drink that contains quinine, which gives it a slightly bitter taste. It is often sweetened with sugar or high-fructose corn syrup and flavored with citrus or other botanicals. Tonic water is generally gluten-free, but it’s essential to check the label for any additives or flavorings that may contain gluten.</p>
