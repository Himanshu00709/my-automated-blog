    <h1>Gluten-Free Margaritas: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Margaritas are one of the most beloved cocktails worldwide, known for their refreshing blend of tequila, lime, and orange liqueur. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a margarita can be a bit more complicated. The good news is that with the right ingredients and knowledge, you can savor a delicious gluten-free margarita without worry. In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free margaritas, from the basics to advanced tips and recipes.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Margarita Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>At its core, a classic margarita is made with three main ingredients: tequila, lime juice, and orange liqueur.

Therefore, it’s essential to carefully select your ingredients to ensure your margarita is 100% gluten-free.</p>
