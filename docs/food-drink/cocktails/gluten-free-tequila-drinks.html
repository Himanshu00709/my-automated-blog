<h1>Gluten-Free Tequila Drinks: A Guide to Delicious and Safe Cocktails</h1>

<p>For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding safe and enjoyable alcoholic beverages can be a challenge. Fortunately, tequila, a beloved spirit made from the blue agave plant, is naturally gluten-free. This makes it an excellent choice for anyone with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free tequila drinks, from classic cocktails to creative concoctions, and provide tips for ensuring your drinks remain safe and delicious.</p>

<h2>Why Tequila is Gluten-Free</h2>

<p>Tequila is distilled from the blue agave plant, which is naturally gluten-free. Unlike some spirits that are made from grains like wheat, barley, or rye, tequila’s primary ingredient is agave, making it a safe option for those avoiding gluten. However, it’s important to note that not all tequilas are created equal. Some flavored or mixed tequilas may contain additives or flavorings that introduce gluten, so always check the label or contact the manufacturer if you’re unsure.</p>
