    <h1>Best Gluten-Free Cocktails: A Guide for Health-Conscious Drinkers</h1>

    <p>For those who follow a gluten-free lifestyle, finding the perfect cocktail can be a challenge. Many alcoholic beverages contain gluten, either as a primary ingredient or as a byproduct of the distillation process.
