    <h1>Are Bloody Marys Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Bloody Marys are a classic cocktail enjoyed by many, especially during brunch or as a hangover cure. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Are Bloody Marys gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients of a Bloody Mary, explore potential sources of gluten, and provide tips for ensuring your Bloody Mary is safe to drink.</p>

    <h2>What is a Bloody Mary?</h2>

    <p>A Bloody Mary is a savory cocktail typically made with vodka, tomato juice, and various spices and flavorings. Common ingredients include Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, horseradish, celery salt, and black pepper. The drink is often garnished with celery, olives, pickles, or even bacon, making it a hearty and flavorful option.</p>

    <h2>Gluten in Alcoholic Beverages</h2>

    <p>Before we delve into the specifics of a Bloody Mary, it’s important to understand the role of gluten in alcoholic beverages. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. While distilled spirits like vodka are generally considered gluten-free due to the distillation process, some people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity may still react to certain types of alcohol, especially those made from gluten-containing grains.</p>
