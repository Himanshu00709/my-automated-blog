    <h1>Are Mojitos Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>
    <p>Mojitos are one of the most popular cocktails worldwide, known for their refreshing blend of mint, lime, sugar, rum, and soda water. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Are mojitos gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients of a mojito, explore potential sources of gluten, and provide tips for enjoying a safe and delicious gluten-free mojito.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Does It Matter?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to long-term health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial to ensure that foods and beverages, including cocktails, are free from gluten.</p>

    <h2>Breaking Down the Mojito Ingredients</h2>
    <p>To determine whether a mojito is gluten-free, let’s examine each of its key ingredients:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>White Rum</td>
                <td>Typically Gluten-Free</td>
                <td>Most distilled spirits, including rum, are gluten-free due to the distillation process. However, flavored rums may contain gluten additives.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Fresh Mint</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
                <td>Fresh herbs like mint are naturally gluten-free.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lime Juice</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
                <td>Freshly squeezed lime juice is safe, but bottled lime juice may contain additives. Always check labels.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sugar</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
                <td>Plain sugar is gluten-free, but some sugar mixes or syrups may contain gluten. Opt for pure cane sugar.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Soda Water</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
                <td>Plain soda water is gluten-free, but flavored varieties may contain gluten. Stick to unflavored options.</td>

        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Potential Gluten Contamination in Mojitos</h2>
    <p>While the core ingredients of a mojito are generally gluten-free, there are a few areas where gluten contamination can occur:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flavored Rums:</strong> Some rums may have added flavors or ingredients that contain gluten. Always check the label or contact the manufacturer.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Made Mixes:</strong> Bottled mojito mixes or syrups may contain gluten as a thickening agent or flavor enhancer.</li>
        <li><strong>Bar Practices:</strong> Cross-contamination can occur in bars where gluten-containing ingredients are used. For example, shared shakers or garnishes may pose a risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Ensure Your Mojito is Gluten-Free</h2>
    <p>If you’re making a mojito at home, you have full control over the ingredients. Here’s how to ensure your mojito is gluten-free:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a gluten-free rum. Stick to plain white rum or verify the gluten-free status of flavored varieties.</li>
        <li>Use fresh ingredients. Avoid pre-made mixes or syrups unless they are certified gluten-free.</li>
        <li>Check labels. Even seemingly safe ingredients like lime juice or soda water can contain hidden gluten.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>When ordering a mojito at a bar or restaurant, communicate your dietary needs clearly. Ask about the ingredients and preparation methods to avoid cross-contamination.</p>
