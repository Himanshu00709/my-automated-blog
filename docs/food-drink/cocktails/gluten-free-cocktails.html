    <h1>Gluten-Free Cocktails: A Guide to Safe and Delicious Drinking</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of cocktails can be a daunting task. Many alcoholic beverages contain gluten, either as a primary ingredient or as a result of cross-contamination during production. However, with a little knowledge and creativity, you can enjoy a wide variety of gluten-free cocktails that are both safe and delicious. In this guide, we’ll explore the basics of gluten-free drinking, provide recipes for some popular gluten-free cocktails, and answer common questions about gluten in alcoholic beverages.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten in Alcoholic Beverages</h2>

However, gluten can also be found in some spirits and liqueurs, especially those that use grain-based alcohol or additives. The good news is that many distilled spirits are naturally gluten-free, as the distillation process removes gluten proteins. However, it’s essential to be cautious with flavored spirits and mixers, as they may contain gluten-containing ingredients.</p>
