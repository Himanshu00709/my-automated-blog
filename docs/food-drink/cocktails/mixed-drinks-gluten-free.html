    <h1>Gluten-Free Mixed Drinks: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of mixed drinks can be a daunting task. While many alcoholic beverages are naturally gluten-free, others contain hidden sources of gluten that can trigger adverse reactions. This guide will help you understand which mixed drinks are safe to consume and how to enjoy a night out without compromising your health.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten in Alcoholic Beverages</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. In the context of alcoholic beverages, gluten can be present in beers, ales, lagers, and malt beverages. However, distilled spirits like vodka, gin, and whiskey are generally considered gluten-free, even if they are made from gluten-containing grains, because the distillation process removes gluten proteins. That said, cross-contamination can occur during production, so it's essential to choose brands that certify their products as gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Spirits for Mixed Drinks</h2>
    <p>When crafting gluten-free mixed drinks, the choice of spirit is crucial. Here are some popular gluten-free options:</p>
    <table>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Mixers and Ingredients</h2>
    <p>In addition to choosing the right spirits, it's essential to select gluten-free mixers and ingredients. Many pre-made mixers, syrups, and flavorings contain gluten or are at risk of cross-contamination. Here are some safe options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fresh Juices:</strong> Lemon, lime, orange, and grapefruit juices are naturally gluten-free and add a refreshing twist to your drinks.</li>
        <li><strong>Soda Water and Tonic Water:</strong> These are typically gluten-free, but always check the label for any additives.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple Syrup:</strong> Made from sugar and water, simple syrup is a safe choice for sweetening your cocktails.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh Herbs and Fruits:</strong> Mint, basil, strawberries, and other fresh ingredients can enhance the flavor of your drink without adding gluten.</li>
    </ul>
