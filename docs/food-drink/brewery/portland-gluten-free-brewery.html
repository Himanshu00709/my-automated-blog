    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free beer is not just for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Many people choose gluten-free beer for its unique flavors and the health benefits associated with avoiding gluten. Gluten-free beers are often made with alternative grains that can offer a different taste profile compared to traditional barley-based beers. Additionally, some people find that gluten-free beers are easier on their digestive system, even if they do not have a diagnosed gluten intolerance.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free breweries are often more mindful of the ingredients they use, opting for organic and non-GMO grains, which can be a healthier choice for all beer drinkers. The attention to detail in the brewing process also means that gluten-free beers are often crafted with the same care and passion as traditional craft beers, resulting in a high-quality product that stands out in the crowded beer market.</p>

    <h2>The Brewing Process: How Gluten-Free Beer is Made</h2>

    <p>The brewing process for gluten-free beer is similar to that of traditional beer, but with a few key differences. Instead of using barley, wheat, or rye, gluten-free breweries use alternative grains such as sorghum, millet, rice, and quinoa. These grains are malted and mashed just like traditional grains, but they do not contain gluten, making them safe for those with gluten intolerance.</p>

    <p>One of the challenges of brewing gluten-free beer is achieving the same depth of flavor and mouthfeel as traditional beer. Gluten-free brewers often use a combination of grains and adjuncts, such as corn or rice, to create a balanced and flavorful beer. Some breweries also use enzymes to break down any residual gluten, ensuring that the final product is completely gluten-free.</p>

    <p>Another important aspect of gluten-free brewing is the avoidance of cross-contamination. Gluten-free breweries take extra precautions to ensure that their equipment is thoroughly cleaned and that no gluten-containing ingredients come into contact with their gluten-free beers. This level of care and attention to detail is what sets Portland's gluten-free breweries apart from the rest.</p>
