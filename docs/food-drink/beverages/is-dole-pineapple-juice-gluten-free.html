In this article, we will delve into the details of Dole Pineapple Juice, its ingredients, and whether it is safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten can cause discomfort and other symptoms. Therefore, it is essential to carefully scrutinize the ingredients of any food or beverage to ensure it is gluten-free.</p>

    <p>To determine whether Dole Pineapple Juice is gluten-free, it is essential to examine its ingredients. The primary ingredient in Dole Pineapple Juice is pineapple juice, which is naturally gluten-free. However, some beverages may contain additives or flavorings that could introduce gluten.</p>
