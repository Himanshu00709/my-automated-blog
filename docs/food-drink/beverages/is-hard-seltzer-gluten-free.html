    <h1>Is Hard Seltzer Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Hard seltzer has taken the beverage world by storm, offering a refreshing, low-calorie alternative to traditional alcoholic drinks. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question remains: <strong>Is hard seltzer gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, brewing process, and labeling of hard seltzers to help you make an informed choice.</p>

    <h2>What is Hard Seltzer?</h2>

    <p>Hard seltzer is a carbonated alcoholic beverage typically made from fermented sugar, water, and natural flavors. It’s known for its light, crisp taste and relatively low alcohol content, usually ranging from 4% to 6% ABV. The drink has gained popularity due to its refreshing nature and lower calorie count compared to beer, wine, and cocktails.</p>

    <h2>Is Hard Seltzer Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The gluten-free status of hard seltzer depends on its ingredients and production process. Most hard seltzers are made from fermented cane sugar or malted grains.

If you’re unsure about a product’s gluten content, it’s best to contact the manufacturer directly or look for a gluten-free label.</p>
