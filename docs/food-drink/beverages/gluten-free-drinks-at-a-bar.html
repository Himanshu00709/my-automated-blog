<h1>Gluten-Free Drinks at a Bar: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Navigating a bar menu can be challenging for anyone, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, it can be downright daunting. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can sneak into many beverages, making it essential to know which drinks are safe to consume. This guide will walk you through the best gluten-free drink options at a bar, ensuring you can enjoy your night out without worry.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten in Drinks</h2>

<p>Before diving into the drink options, it's crucial to understand where gluten might be hiding in your beverages. While most people associate gluten with food, it can also be present in drinks, particularly those made from grains. Beer, for example, is typically made from barley, which contains gluten. However, there are now many gluten-free beer options available. Additionally, some spirits and mixers may contain gluten or be processed in facilities that handle gluten-containing products, so it's essential to be vigilant.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Beer Options</h2>

<p>For beer lovers, the good news is that the market for gluten-free beers has expanded significantly in recent years. Many breweries now offer gluten-free options made from alternative grains like sorghum, rice, or millet. Here are some popular gluten-free beer brands you might find at your local bar:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Brand</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Gluten-Free Certification</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Omission</td>
        <td>Lager, IPA, Pale Ale</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Glutenberg</td>
        <td>Blonde Ale, Red Ale, IPA</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>New Planet</td>
        <td>Pale Ale, Blonde Ale, Amber Ale</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ground Breaker</td>
        <td>IPA, Dark Ale, Pale Ale</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>When ordering, always ask the bartender if they have any gluten-free beer options. If they don't, don't worry—there are plenty of other gluten-free drink choices available.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Spirits and Cocktails</h2>

<p>Most distilled spirits are naturally gluten-free, as the distillation process removes gluten proteins. However, some spirits may have additives or flavorings that contain gluten, so it's essential to check the label or ask the bartender. Here are some common gluten-free spirits:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Vodka:</strong> Made from potatoes or corn, such as Tito's Handmade Vodka.</li>
    <li><strong>Gin:</strong> Typically made from juniper berries and other botanicals, such as Hendrick's Gin.</li>
    <li><strong>Rum:</strong> Made from sugarcane, such as Bacardi.</li>
    <li><strong>Tequila:</strong> Made from the agave plant, such as Patrón.</li>
    <li><strong>Whiskey:</strong> Some whiskey brands are gluten-free, but always check the label.</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to cocktails, the key is to ensure that all ingredients are gluten-free. Stick to simple cocktails like a vodka soda, gin and tonic, or a classic margarita. Avoid pre-made mixers, as they may contain gluten. Instead, opt for fresh ingredients like lime juice, simple syrup, and soda water.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Wine and Cider</h2>

<p>Wine is naturally gluten-free, as it is made from grapes. However, some winemakers may use gluten-containing products during the fining process, so it's always a good idea to check with the bartender or look for a gluten-free label. Cider, made from fermented apples, is also a great gluten-free option. Here are some popular gluten-free wine and cider brands:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Brand</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Gluten-Free Certification</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Yellow Tail</td>
        <td>Red, White, Rosé</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Barefoot</td>
        <td>Red, White, Rosé</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Angry Orchard</td>
        <td>Hard Cider</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Strongbow</td>
        <td>Hard Cider</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
</table>
