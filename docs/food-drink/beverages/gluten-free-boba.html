    <h1>Gluten-Free Boba: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Boba tea, also known as bubble tea, has become a global phenomenon, captivating taste buds with its unique combination of tea, milk, and chewy tapioca pearls. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this delightful beverage can be a challenge. This guide will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free boba, from its ingredients to where you can find it, and even how to make it at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Boba?</h2>

    <p>Boba tea originated in Taiwan in the 1980s and has since spread worldwide. The drink typically consists of a tea base mixed with milk or fruit flavors, sweetened with sugar, and served with chewy tapioca pearls. These pearls, often referred to as "boba," are made from tapioca starch, which is derived from the cassava root. While tapioca pearls are naturally gluten-free, other ingredients in boba tea may contain gluten, making it essential for those with gluten sensitivities to be cautious.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten in Boba</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. While tapioca pearls are gluten-free, other components of boba tea, such as certain flavorings, syrups, or additives, may contain gluten. Cross-contamination is also a concern, especially in establishments that prepare gluten-containing foods alongside boba tea.</p>
