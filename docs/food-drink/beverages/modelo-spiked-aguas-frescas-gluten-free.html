    <h1>Modelo Spiked Aguas Frescas: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

One such product that has captured the attention of many is Modelo Spiked Aguas Frescas. This refreshing drink combines the traditional flavors of aguas frescas with a modern twist, offering a gluten-free option for those who want to enjoy a light, flavorful beverage without compromising on their dietary needs. In this article, we will delve into the details of Modelo Spiked Aguas Frescas, exploring its origins, flavors, nutritional benefits, and why it has become a favorite among gluten-free enthusiasts.</p>

    <h2>What Are Aguas Frescas?</h2>
    <p>Aguas frescas, which translates to "fresh waters," are traditional Mexican beverages made by blending fruits, grains, or seeds with water and sugar. These drinks are known for their refreshing qualities and are often enjoyed during hot weather. Common flavors include horchata (made from rice and cinnamon), tamarind, hibiscus, and various fruit combinations like watermelon, pineapple, and cucumber. Aguas frescas are typically non-alcoholic, but Modelo has taken this concept to the next level by introducing a spiked version that retains the essence of the traditional drink while adding a subtle kick of alcohol.</p>
