    <h1>Horchata: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>Horchata, a traditional beverage with roots in Latin America and Spain, has gained popularity worldwide for its refreshing taste and versatility. Made primarily from rice, almonds, or tiger nuts, horchata is naturally gluten-free, making it an excellent choice for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. In this article, we’ll explore the origins of horchata, its health benefits, and why it’s a perfect gluten-free option for everyone to enjoy.</p>

    <h2>The Origins of Horchata</h2>
    <p>Horchata has a rich history that dates back centuries. The drink originated in Valencia, Spain, where it was traditionally made from tiger nuts (chufa). Spanish colonizers brought the recipe to Latin America, where it evolved to include local ingredients like rice and almonds. Today, horchata is enjoyed in various forms across Mexico, Central America, and even the United States. Its creamy texture and sweet, cinnamon-infused flavor make it a beloved beverage for all ages.</p>

    <h2>Why Horchata is Gluten-Free</h2>
