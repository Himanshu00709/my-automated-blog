    <h1>Gluten-Free Eggnog Brands: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Eggnog is a classic holiday beverage that brings warmth and cheer to festive gatherings. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a safe and delicious gluten-free eggnog can be a challenge. Fortunately, several brands have stepped up to offer gluten-free options that don’t compromise on taste or quality. In this article, we’ll explore some of the best gluten-free eggnog brands available, discuss what makes them stand out, and provide tips for enjoying this seasonal treat safely.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Eggnog Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Traditional eggnog is made from a blend of milk, cream, sugar, eggs, and spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. While these ingredients are naturally gluten-free, cross-contamination during processing or the addition of flavorings and thickeners can introduce gluten. Gluten-free eggnog brands ensure that their products are free from gluten-containing ingredients and are processed in facilities that prevent cross-contamination.</p>
