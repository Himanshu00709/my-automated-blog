<h1>Gluten-Free Red Wine Brands: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For wine enthusiasts with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a safe and enjoyable red wine can be a challenge. While wine is naturally gluten-free, the winemaking process can sometimes introduce gluten through additives or cross-contamination. In this guide, we’ll explore some of the best gluten-free red wine brands, what makes them safe, and how to enjoy them responsibly.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten in Wine</h2>

<p>Wine is made from fermented grapes, which are naturally gluten-free. However, some winemaking practices can introduce gluten into the final product. For example, some winemakers use wheat-based products to seal barrels or add flavor-enhancing agents that may contain gluten. Additionally, cross-contamination can occur during production or bottling. Therefore, it’s essential to choose wines that are certified gluten-free or produced in dedicated gluten-free facilities.</p>
