<h1>Best Gluten-Free Red Wines: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For wine enthusiasts with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding the perfect gluten-free red wine can be a daunting task. While wine is naturally gluten-free, the winemaking process can sometimes introduce gluten, especially in the fining process. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about gluten-free red wines, including the best options available, how to identify them, and tips for enjoying your wine without worry.</p>

<h2>What Makes a Wine Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Wine is made from fermented grapes, which are naturally gluten-free. However, some winemaking practices can introduce gluten into the final product. For example, some winemakers use wheat-based products during the fining process to clarify the wine. Additionally, barrels sealed with wheat paste or other gluten-containing materials can also contaminate the wine. Therefore, it's essential to choose wines that are certified gluten-free or produced in a gluten-free facility.</p>
