<h1>Pumpkin Spice Latte Starbucks Gluten-Free Guide</h1>

<p>As the leaves begin to change and the air turns crisp, one beverage reigns supreme in the hearts of coffee lovers everywhere: the Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) from Starbucks. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Is the Pumpkin Spice Latte at Starbucks gluten-free? In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about enjoying this seasonal favorite while staying gluten-free.</p>

<h2>What is a Pumpkin Spice Latte?</h2>

<p>The Pumpkin Spice Latte, often abbreviated as PSL, is a seasonal drink offered by Starbucks that combines espresso, steamed milk, and a blend of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove flavors. Topped with whipped cream and a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spices, it’s a quintessential fall treat. But for those who need to avoid gluten, understanding the ingredients is crucial.</p>

<h2>Is the Pumpkin Spice Latte Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Starbucks does not officially label the Pumpkin Spice Latte as gluten-free. However, the primary ingredients in the PSL—espresso, milk, and pumpkin spice sauce—do not contain gluten. The pumpkin spice sauce is made from sugar, condensed skim milk, pumpkin puree, and natural flavors, none of which are gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

<p>That said, cross-contamination is always a concern in environments where gluten-containing products are prepared. Starbucks prepares a variety of food and drink items, some of which contain gluten. Therefore, while the ingredients themselves may be gluten-free, there is a risk of cross-contamination.</p>

<h2>How to Order a Gluten-Free Pumpkin Spice Latte</h2>

<p>If you’re looking to enjoy a Pumpkin Spice Latte while minimizing the risk of gluten exposure, here are some tips:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ask for a Clean Equipment:</strong> Request that the barista uses a clean espresso machine and steam wand to reduce the risk of cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Skip the Whipped Cream:</strong> While the whipped cream itself is gluten-free, it may come into contact with gluten-containing products. You can ask for your drink without whipped cream to be safe.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt for Alternative Milk:</strong> If you’re also avoiding dairy, Starbucks offers a variety of gluten-free milk alternatives such as almond milk, coconut milk, and oat milk (ensure the oat milk is certified gluten-free).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Nutritional Information</h2>

<p>For those who are health-conscious or have dietary restrictions, understanding the nutritional content of the Pumpkin Spice Latte is important. Below is a table outlining the nutritional information for a Grande (16 oz) Pumpkin Spice Latte made with 2% milk and whipped cream:</p>
