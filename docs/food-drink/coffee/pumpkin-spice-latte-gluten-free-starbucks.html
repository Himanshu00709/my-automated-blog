    <p>While the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during preparation. Starbucks does not guarantee that any of their products are completely free from allergens, including gluten. Therefore, it’s essential to communicate your dietary needs clearly when ordering.</p>

    <h2>How to Order a Gluten-Free Pumpkin Spice Latte</h2>
    <p>Ordering a gluten-free Pumpkin Spice Latte at Starbucks requires a bit of communication with your barista. Here are some steps to ensure your drink is as safe as possible:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Inform the Barista:</strong> Let the barista know that you have a gluten sensitivity or celiac disease and need to avoid gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Request Clean Equipment:</strong> Ask if they can use clean equipment to prepare your drink to minimize the risk of cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Skip the Whipped Cream:</strong> While the whipped cream itself is gluten-free, the canisters used to dispense it may come into contact with gluten-containing products. If you’re highly sensitive, consider skipping the whipped cream.</li>
        <li><strong>Double-Check Ingredients:</strong> Starbucks occasionally updates their recipes, so it’s a good idea to double-check the ingredients list for the Pumpkin Spice Latte to ensure nothing has changed.</li>
    </ol>
