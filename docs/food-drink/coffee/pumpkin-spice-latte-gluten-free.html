    <h1>Pumpkin Spice Latte Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>As the leaves change color and the air turns crisp, the arrival of fall brings with it the beloved Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL). For many, this seasonal beverage is a must-have, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a PSL can be a bit more complicated. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about enjoying a gluten-free Pumpkin Spice Latte, from understanding the ingredients to making your own at home.</p>

    <p>To determine whether a Pumpkin Spice Latte is gluten-free, it’s essential to examine the ingredients used in its preparation. Traditional PSLs typically include espresso, steamed milk, pumpkin spice syrup, and whipped cream. The primary concern for those avoiding gluten is the pumpkin spice syrup, which can sometimes contain hidden gluten or be processed in facilities that handle gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

    <p>Here’s a breakdown of the key components:</p>

                <td>Check for gluten-free certification</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Whipped Cream</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free (unless flavored with gluten-containing additives)</td>
            </tr>
