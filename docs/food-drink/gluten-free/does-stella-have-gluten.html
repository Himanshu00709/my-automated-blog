    <h1>Does Stella Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply choosing to avoid gluten, understanding which foods and beverages are safe to consume is crucial. One common question that arises is: <strong>Does Stella have gluten?</strong> In this article, we will delve into the details of Stella Artois, its ingredients, and whether it is safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Stella Artois?</h2>

    <p>Stella Artois is a globally recognized Belgian pilsner beer that has been brewed since 1926. Known for its crisp, clean taste and golden color, Stella Artois is a popular choice among beer enthusiasts. However, for those who need to avoid gluten, the question of whether Stella Artois contains gluten is of paramount importance.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Stella Artois</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Stella Artois contains gluten, it's essential to look at its ingredients. The primary ingredients in Stella Artois include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> The base of any beer, water is naturally gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Malted Barley:</strong> Barley is a gluten-containing grain, which is a key ingredient in traditional beer brewing.</li>
        <li><strong>Hops:</strong> Hops are used to add bitterness and aroma to the beer and are gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Yeast:</strong> Yeast is used for fermentation and is also gluten-free.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Given that barley is a primary ingredient in Stella Artois, it is clear that the beer contains gluten. However, the exact amount of gluten can vary, and some individuals with mild gluten sensitivity may tolerate it better than others.</p>

    <h2>Gluten Content in Stella Artois</h2>

    <p>Stella Artois is brewed using traditional methods that involve barley, which contains gluten. The gluten content in Stella Artois is typically around 20 parts per million (ppm), which is the threshold set by many countries for labeling a product as "gluten-free." However, Stella Artois does not meet this threshold and is not considered gluten-free.</p>

            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Water</td>

            </tr>

        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Is Stella Artois Safe for Celiac Disease Patients?</h2>

Since Stella Artois contains gluten, it is not safe for those with celiac disease. Even though the gluten content is relatively low, it is still above the threshold considered safe for celiac patients.</p>

    <p>For those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, the tolerance level may vary. Some individuals may be able to consume Stella Artois without experiencing symptoms, while others may need to avoid it entirely. It is always best to consult with a healthcare provider if you are unsure.</p>
