    <h1>Is Chai Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Chai, a spiced tea beverage originating from India, has gained immense popularity worldwide. Its rich blend of spices, tea, and milk creates a comforting and aromatic drink that many enjoy daily. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Is chai gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we will explore the ingredients of chai, potential sources of gluten, and how to ensure your chai is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It acts as a binding agent, giving elasticity to dough and helping it rise. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine.</p>

    <p>When it comes to beverages like chai, gluten is not typically an ingredient. However, cross-contamination or hidden sources of gluten can pose a risk. Let's break down the components of chai to understand where gluten might be lurking.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Traditional Chai</h2>

    <p>Traditional chai is made from a combination of the following ingredients:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tea Leaves:</strong> Typically black tea, which is naturally gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices:</strong> Common spices include cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves, and black pepper. These spices are also gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Dairy or plant-based milk, both of which are gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweetener:</strong> Sugar, honey, or other sweeteners, which are gluten-free.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, chai appears to be gluten-free. However, there are some factors to consider that could introduce gluten into your chai.</p>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Chai</h2>
