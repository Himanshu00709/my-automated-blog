<h1>Is Core Power Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and the general trend toward healthier eating. Core Power, a popular protein shake brand, has gained attention for its high-protein content and convenience. But for those who need to avoid gluten, the question arises: Is Core Power gluten-free? In this article, we’ll delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to provide a clear answer.</p>

<h2>What is Core Power?</h2>

<p>Core Power is a line of high-protein shakes produced by Fairlife, a subsidiary of Coca-Cola. These shakes are marketed as a convenient way to consume high-quality protein, particularly for athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and those looking to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Core Power shakes are made from ultra-filtered milk, which provides a higher protein content and lower sugar content compared to regular milk.</p>

<p>The product comes in various flavors, including chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry, and is available in different sizes to suit individual needs. Given its popularity, it’s essential to understand whether Core Power is safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Implications</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to various health issues. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity can also cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue, though it doesn’t involve the same immune response.</p>

<p>Given the potential health risks, it’s crucial for those with gluten-related disorders to carefully scrutinize food labels and understand the manufacturing processes of the products they consume.</p>

<h2>Is Core Power Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>To determine whether Core Power is gluten-free, we need to examine its ingredients and manufacturing processes. According to Fairlife, the company that produces Core Power, the shakes are made from ultra-filtered milk, which is naturally gluten-free. However, it’s essential to consider whether any additives or cross-contamination during manufacturing could introduce gluten into the product.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown of the ingredients in Core Power shakes:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Ingredient</th>
            <th>Source</th>
            <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Ultra-Filtered Milk</td>
            <td>Milk</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Lactose</td>
            <td>Milk</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cocoa (in chocolate flavor)</td>
            <td>Cocoa Beans</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Natural Flavors</td>
            <td>Various Sources</td>
            <td>Typically Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Stabilizers (e.g., Carrageenan)</td>
            <td>Seaweed</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>As seen in the table above, the primary ingredients in Core Power shakes are naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that the term “natural flavors” can sometimes be ambiguous. While most natural flavors are gluten-free, there’s always a slight risk of cross-contamination if the flavors are derived from gluten-containing sources or processed in facilities that handle gluten.</p>

<h2>Manufacturing and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

<p>Even if the ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can pose a risk. Fairlife has stated that Core Power is produced in facilities that also process other products, some of which may contain gluten. However, the company follows strict cleaning protocols to minimize the risk of cross-contamination.</p>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, this information is crucial. While the risk of cross-contamination is low, it’s not entirely eliminated. Therefore, those with severe gluten-related disorders should exercise caution and consult with their healthcare provider before consuming Core Power.</p>

<h2>Certifications and Labeling</h2>

<p>One way to ensure a product is gluten-free is to look for certifications from recognized organizations. Core Power does not currently carry a gluten-free certification from organizations like the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). However, the absence of certification doesn’t necessarily mean the product contains gluten; it simply means it hasn’t been formally tested and certified.</p>

<p>Fairlife does label its products clearly, and Core Power shakes are labeled as containing no gluten-containing ingredients. This labeling is a good indicator, but it’s not as rigorous as a formal certification.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Core Power and Gluten</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Is Core Power safe for people with celiac disease?</h3>
    <p>Core Power is made from gluten-free ingredients, but it is produced in facilities that also process gluten-containing products. While the risk of cross-contamination is low, individuals with celiac disease should consult their healthcare provider before consuming Core Power.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I trust the labeling on Core Power products?</h3>
    <p>Fairlife is a reputable company, and their labeling is generally reliable. However, if you have severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, it’s always best to consult with your healthcare provider or look for products with formal gluten-free certifications.</p>

    <h3>4. Are there any gluten-containing ingredients in Core Power?</h3>
    <p>No, Core Power does not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. The primary ingredients are ultra-filtered milk, lactose, and natural flavors, all of which are gluten-free.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, Core Power shakes are made from gluten-free ingredients and are labeled as containing no gluten-containing ingredients. However, they are produced in facilities that also process gluten-containing products, which introduces a slight risk of cross-contamination. For most people with gluten sensitivity, Core Power is likely safe to consume. However, individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity should exercise caution and consult with their healthcare provider before including Core Power in their diet.</p>

<p>As always, it’s essential to read labels carefully and stay informed about the products you consume. If you’re looking for a high-protein, convenient shake and are not severely sensitive to gluten, Core Power could be a great option for you.</p>
