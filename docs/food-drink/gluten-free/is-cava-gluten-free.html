<h1>Is Cava Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing prevalence of celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and a general shift toward healthier eating habits. One question that often arises is whether Cava, a popular Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant chain, offers gluten-free options. This article delves into the details of Cava's menu, ingredients, and preparation methods to answer the question: Is Cava gluten-free?</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Implications</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to a host of health issues. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can cause discomfort, bloating, and other digestive problems. Therefore, understanding whether a food item or restaurant is gluten-free is crucial for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

<h2>Cava's Commitment to Gluten-Free Options</h2>

<p>Cava has made significant strides in catering to various dietary needs, including gluten-free diets. The restaurant chain offers a variety of gluten-free options, making it a popular choice for those who need to avoid gluten. However, it's essential to understand the nuances of their menu and preparation methods to ensure a safe dining experience.</p>

<h3>Gluten-Free Ingredients at Cava</h3>

<p>Cava's menu is built around fresh, wholesome ingredients, many of which are naturally gluten-free. Here are some of the key gluten-free ingredients you can find at Cava:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Greens and Grains:</strong> Cava offers a variety of greens and grains, including arugula, spinach, and romaine lettuce, which are all gluten-free. They also provide gluten-free grains like brown rice and lentils.</li>
    <li><strong>Proteins:</strong> Most of Cava's protein options, such as grilled chicken, braised lamb, and falafel, are gluten-free. However, it's essential to verify the ingredients and preparation methods, as some proteins may contain gluten-based additives.</li>

    <li><strong>Certain Proteins:</strong> Some proteins, such as the spicy lamb meatballs, may contain gluten-based fillers or binders. Always ask the staff for clarification.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> Even if an ingredient is gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during preparation. Cava takes precautions to minimize this risk, but it's always a good idea to inform the staff of your dietary restrictions.</li>
