    <h1>Gluten-Free Eggnog: A Festive Delight for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Eggnog is a classic holiday beverage that brings warmth and cheer to gatherings. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional eggnog recipes can be a source of concern due to potential cross-contamination or hidden gluten ingredients. Fortunately, gluten-free eggnog is not only possible but also delicious and easy to make. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free eggnog, from its history to recipes and FAQs.</p>

    <h2>What is Eggnog?</h2>
    <p>Eggnog is a rich, creamy drink traditionally made with milk, cream, sugar, whipped eggs, and often spiked with alcohol like rum, brandy, or bourbon. It’s a staple during the holiday season, enjoyed by many for its indulgent flavor and festive appeal. The origins of eggnog date back to medieval Europe, where it was known as "posset," a hot, milky, ale-like drink. Over time, it evolved into the chilled, spiced beverage we know today.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems. Even trace amounts of gluten can cause reactions in sensitive individuals. Therefore, ensuring that your eggnog is gluten-free is essential for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Is Traditional Eggnog Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>In its purest form, eggnog made from scratch with simple ingredients like milk, cream, eggs, and sugar is naturally gluten-free. However, store-bought eggnog or pre-mixed versions may contain additives, thickeners, or flavorings that include gluten. Additionally, cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing. Always check labels carefully or opt for certified gluten-free brands.</p>
