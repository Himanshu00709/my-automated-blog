    <h1>Is Absolut Citron Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>When it comes to enjoying a refreshing cocktail, many people are concerned about whether their drink contains gluten, especially those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Absolut Citron, a popular vodka infused with citrus flavors, is often a go-to choice for many cocktail enthusiasts. But is Absolut Citron gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, production process, and certifications to determine whether Absolut Citron is safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in grains like wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. As a result, many people are vigilant about checking the gluten content in their food and beverages, including alcoholic drinks like vodka.</p>

    <p>Vodka is traditionally made from grains, which naturally contain gluten. However, the distillation process is known to remove gluten proteins, making many vodkas technically gluten-free. But the question remains: does this apply to Absolut Citron?</p>

    <h2>What is Absolut Citron?</h2>

    <p>Absolut Citron is a flavored vodka produced by the Swedish brand Absolut. It is made by infusing Absolut’s original vodka with natural citrus flavors, primarily lemon and lime. The result is a smooth, zesty vodka that is perfect for cocktails like the classic Cosmopolitan or a simple vodka soda with a twist of citrus.</p>

    <p>Absolut is known for its commitment to quality and transparency in its production process. The brand uses winter wheat and water from a deep well in Åhus, Sweden, to create its vodka. But does this mean Absolut Citron is gluten-free?</p>

    <h2>Is Absolut Citron Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>According to Absolut, their vodka, including Absolut Citron, is gluten-free. The distillation process used in the production of Absolut vodka removes the gluten proteins, making the final product safe for those with gluten sensitivities. However, it’s important to note that Absolut does not label its products as “gluten-free” because they are made from wheat, which is a gluten-containing grain.</p>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease, the Celiac Disease Foundation states that distilled spirits, including vodka, are generally considered safe because the distillation process removes gluten proteins. However, some people with celiac disease may still experience reactions to distilled spirits made from gluten-containing grains due to cross-contamination or other factors.</p>

    <h2>Production Process of Absolut Citron</h2>

    <p>To better understand whether Absolut Citron is gluten-free, let’s take a closer look at its production process:</p>

                <td>The wheat is fermented to produce a mash, which is then distilled to create a high-proof alcohol.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3. Distillation</td>
                <td>The alcohol is distilled multiple times to remove impurities, including gluten proteins.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4. Flavor Infusion</td>
                <td>Natural citrus flavors, primarily lemon and lime, are added to the distilled vodka to create Absolut Citron.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5. Bottling</td>
