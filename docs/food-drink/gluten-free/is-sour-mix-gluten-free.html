    <h1>Is Sour Mix Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>When it comes to dietary restrictions, particularly gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding the ingredients in your food and beverages is crucial. Sour mix, a popular cocktail ingredient, is often a point of concern for those avoiding gluten. In this article, we’ll dive deep into what sour mix is, its ingredients, and whether it’s safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Sour Mix?</h2>
    <p>Sour mix, also known as sweet and sour mix, is a staple in many cocktails. It’s a blend of citrus juices (typically lemon and lime) and sweeteners, often used to add a tangy, refreshing flavor to drinks like margaritas, whiskey sours, and daiquiris. While it’s commonly found in bars and restaurants, many people also make their own sour mix at home.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Sour Mix</h2>
    <p>To determine whether sour mix is gluten-free, it’s essential to examine its ingredients. The primary components of sour mix include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Citrus Juices:</strong> Lemon and lime juice are naturally gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweeteners:</strong> Sugar or high-fructose corn syrup, which are also gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Preservatives:</strong> Some commercial sour mixes may contain preservatives or artificial flavors, which could potentially contain gluten.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Is Sour Mix Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>In most cases, sour mix is gluten-free. The primary ingredients—citrus juices and sweeteners—do not contain gluten. However, the gluten-free status of sour mix can vary depending on the brand or recipe. Some commercial sour mixes may include additives or flavorings that contain gluten, so it’s essential to read the label carefully or inquire about the ingredients if you’re at a bar or restaurant.</p>

    <h3>Commercial vs. Homemade Sour Mix</h3>
    <p>When it comes to ensuring your sour mix is gluten-free, making it at home is the safest option. Homemade sour mix typically consists of fresh lemon and lime juice, sugar, and water, all of which are naturally gluten-free. On the other hand, commercial sour mixes may contain additional ingredients that could introduce gluten into the mix.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Sour Mix Brands</h2>
    <p>If you prefer the convenience of store-bought sour mix, there are several gluten-free brands available. Below is a table of popular gluten-free sour mix brands:</p>
