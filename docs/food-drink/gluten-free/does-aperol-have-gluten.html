<h1>Does Aperol Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Aperol, the vibrant orange aperitif, has become a staple in many cocktails, most notably the Aperol Spritz. Its unique bittersweet flavor profile makes it a favorite among cocktail enthusiasts.

<p>Aperol is an Italian aperitif that was first introduced in 1919 by the Barbieri brothers. It is characterized by its bright orange color and a flavor that balances bitterness with a hint of sweetness. The drink is made from a blend of herbs, roots, and fruits, including bitter and sweet oranges, gentian, rhubarb, and cinchona. Aperol is typically enjoyed as an aperitif, often mixed with prosecco and soda water to create the popular Aperol Spritz.</p>
