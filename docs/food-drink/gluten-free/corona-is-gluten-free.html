    <h1>Is Corona Gluten-Free? A Detailed Analysis</h1>

    <p>When it comes to enjoying a refreshing beer, many people with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease often wonder if their favorite brews are safe to consume. One of the most popular beers worldwide, Corona, often comes under scrutiny for its gluten content. In this article, we will delve into the details of whether Corona is gluten-free, explore its ingredients, and provide insights for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. As a result, many people seek out gluten-free alternatives to their favorite foods and beverages, including beer.</p>

    <p>Traditional beers are typically made from barley, which contains gluten. However, some beers are brewed with gluten-free grains like sorghum, rice, or corn. The question then arises: where does Corona fit into this spectrum?</p>

    <h2>Corona's Ingredients and Brewing Process</h2>

    <p>Corona is a Mexican lager that is brewed by Grupo Modelo, which is now owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev. The primary ingredients in Corona include water, barley malt, non-malted cereals (such as corn), hops, and yeast. The use of barley malt means that Corona contains gluten, as barley is one of the primary sources of gluten in beer.</p>

    <p>However, it's worth noting that Corona also uses non-malted cereals like corn in its brewing process. Corn is naturally gluten-free, but its presence in Corona does not make the beer gluten-free. The barley malt used in the brewing process ensures that the final product contains gluten.</p>

    <h2>Is Corona Safe for People with Gluten Sensitivity?</h2>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, Corona is not considered safe to consume. The presence of barley malt means that the beer contains gluten, which can trigger adverse reactions in those who are sensitive to it. Even though Corona uses corn, which is gluten-free, the barley malt content makes it unsuitable for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <p>However, some people with mild gluten sensitivity may find that they can tolerate Corona in small amounts. This is because the gluten content in Corona is relatively low compared to other beers that are made exclusively from barley. Nevertheless, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional before consuming any product that contains gluten if you have a gluten-related condition.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Beer Alternatives</h2>

    <p>For those who need to avoid gluten entirely, there are several gluten-free beer options available on the market. These beers are typically made from gluten-free grains like sorghum, rice, or millet. Some popular gluten-free beer brands include:</p>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Bard's</td>
