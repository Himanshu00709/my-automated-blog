    <h1>Is Four Loko Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Four Loko, the infamous alcoholic beverage known for its high alcohol content and bold flavors, has gained a massive following over the years. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Four Loko is gluten-free is of utmost importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, brewing process, and gluten content of Four Loko to provide a comprehensive answer to this question.</p>

    <h2>What is Four Loko?</h2>

    <p>Four Loko is a malt beverage that combines alcohol, caffeine, and various flavors to create a potent and flavorful drink. It was first introduced in 2005 and quickly gained popularity among young adults due to its high alcohol content and unique taste. However, the original formulation, which included caffeine, was banned in 2010 due to safety concerns. Since then, Four Loko has been reformulated without caffeine but continues to be a popular choice for those seeking a strong alcoholic beverage.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Four Loko</h2>

        <li>Sodium Citrate</li>
        <li>Preservatives</li>
