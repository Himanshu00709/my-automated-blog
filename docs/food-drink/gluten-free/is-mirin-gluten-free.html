<h1>Is Mirin Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Mirin, a staple in Japanese cuisine, is a sweet rice wine that adds depth and flavor to a variety of dishes. Whether you're making teriyaki sauce, glazing fish, or adding a touch of sweetness to your stir-fry, mirin is a versatile ingredient. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Is mirin gluten-free? In this article, we'll explore the composition of mirin, its gluten content, and what to look for when purchasing mirin to ensure it fits into a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What is Mirin?</h2>

<p>Mirin is a type of rice wine that originated in Japan. It is made from fermented rice, koji (a type of mold used in fermentation), and shochu (a distilled spirit). The fermentation process gives mirin its characteristic sweetness and umami flavor. There are different types of mirin, including hon-mirin (true mirin), shio-mirin (salted mirin), and mirin-like condiments, which may contain additives or substitutes.</p>

<h2>Is Mirin Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>The primary ingredients in traditional mirin—rice, koji, and shochu—are naturally gluten-free. However, the gluten-free status of mirin can be compromised depending on the production process and any additional ingredients used. Some mirin-like condiments may contain additives, flavorings, or thickeners that could introduce gluten. Therefore, it's essential to read labels carefully and choose products that are certified gluten-free if you have celiac disease or a severe gluten intolerance.</p>
