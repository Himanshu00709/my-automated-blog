    <h1>Do Trulys Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Among the many beverages on the market, Truly Hard Seltzer has gained popularity for its refreshing taste and low-calorie content. But for those who need to avoid gluten, the question remains: <strong>Do Trulys have gluten?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, brewing process, and certifications to provide a clear answer.</p>

    <h2>What is Truly Hard Seltzer?</h2>

    <p>Truly Hard Seltzer is a popular alcoholic beverage that combines sparkling water with alcohol and natural fruit flavors. It is known for being low in calories and carbs, making it a favorite among health-conscious consumers. But what about its gluten content? Let’s explore the ingredients and brewing process to understand whether Truly is safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Truly Hard Seltzer</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Truly contains gluten, it’s essential to examine its ingredients. The primary components of Truly Hard Seltzer include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Carbonated Water</li>
        <li>Alcohol (derived from fermented cane sugar)</li>
        <li>Natural Flavors</li>
        <li>Cane Sugar</li>
        <li>Citric Acid</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Notably, Truly does not contain barley, wheat, rye, or any other gluten-containing grains. Instead, the alcohol in Truly is derived from fermented cane sugar, which is naturally gluten-free. This is a crucial distinction, as many alcoholic beverages, such as beer, are made from gluten-containing grains like barley or wheat.</p>

    <h2>Is Truly Certified Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>While Truly Hard Seltzer does not contain gluten ingredients, it’s important to consider whether it is certified gluten-free. Certification ensures that the product meets strict standards for gluten content, typically less than 20 parts per million (ppm).</p>

    <p>Truly Hard Seltzer is not certified gluten-free by organizations like the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). However, the company states that their products are crafted to be gluten-free and are tested to ensure they meet the FDA’s gluten-free standards. This means that Truly contains less than 20 ppm of gluten, which is considered safe for most people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>Comparing Truly to Other Alcoholic Beverages</h2>

    <p>To better understand Truly’s gluten-free status, let’s compare it to other popular alcoholic beverages:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Beverage</th>
                <th>Gluten Content</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Certification</th>

                <td>Contains gluten</td>
                <td>No (unless specified)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Gluten-Free Beer</td>
                <td>Less than 20 ppm</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Wine</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vodka (made from potatoes)</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
