    <h1>Is Stella Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of food and beverages can be a daunting task. One common question that arises is whether Stella Artois, a popular Belgian pilsner, is gluten-free. In this article, we will delve into the details of Stella Artois, its ingredients, brewing process, and whether it is safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the lining of the small intestine. This can lead to a host of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and nutrient deficiencies. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can cause discomfort and adverse health effects.</p>

    <p>Given the potential health risks, it's crucial for individuals who need to avoid gluten to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and production processes of the foods and beverages they consume. This includes alcoholic beverages like beer, which traditionally contain gluten due to the use of barley and wheat in the brewing process.</p>

    <h2>What is Stella Artois?</h2>

    <p>Stella Artois is a Belgian pilsner that has been brewed since 1366. It is known for its crisp, refreshing taste and is one of the most widely recognized beer brands in the world. The beer is brewed using a combination of malted barley, hops, water, and yeast. These ingredients are typical for traditional beers, which raises questions about its gluten content.</p>

    <h2>Is Stella Artois Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The short answer is no, Stella Artois is not gluten-free. The beer is brewed using malted barley, which contains gluten. As a result, Stella Artois is not suitable for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it's important to note that the brewing process can sometimes reduce the gluten content, but it does not eliminate it entirely.</p>

    <p>For those who are strictly gluten-free, consuming Stella Artois could still pose a risk. Even trace amounts of gluten can cause a reaction in sensitive individuals. Therefore, it's best to avoid Stella Artois if you need to adhere to a gluten-free diet.</p>
