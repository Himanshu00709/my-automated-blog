    <p>As we can see from the table, the primary ingredients in Surfside Lemonade are naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that the term “natural flavors” can sometimes be a gray area, as these flavors may be derived from gluten-containing sources. To be certain, we need to look further into the manufacturing process and any certifications the product may have.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients in a product are gluten-free, cross-contamination during the manufacturing process can introduce gluten. This is a significant concern for individuals with celiac disease, as even trace amounts of gluten can trigger symptoms. Surfside Lemonade is produced in facilities that also handle other products, some of which may contain gluten. However, the company has implemented strict protocols to minimize the risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>Surfside Lemonade is manufactured in a facility that follows Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), which include thorough cleaning procedures between production runs. Additionally, the company conducts regular testing to ensure that their products meet gluten-free standards. While the risk of cross-contamination is low, it’s always a good idea for individuals with severe gluten sensitivity to contact the manufacturer directly for the most up-to-date information.</p>

    <h2>Certifications and Labels</h2>

    <p>One of the most reliable ways to determine if a product is gluten-free is to look for certifications from recognized organizations. Surfside Lemonade is certified gluten-free by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO), which requires products to contain less than 10 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. This certification provides an extra layer of assurance for consumers who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <p>In addition to the GFCO certification, Surfside Lemonade also carries the “Gluten-Free” label on its packaging. This label is regulated by the FDA, which mandates that products labeled as gluten-free must contain less than 20 ppm of gluten. These certifications and labels make Surfside Lemonade a safe choice for those on a gluten-free diet.</p>
