    <h1>Does Twisted Tea Contain Gluten? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Twisted Tea is a popular alcoholic beverage that combines the refreshing taste of iced tea with a hint of alcohol. It has gained a loyal following among those who enjoy a sweet, tangy, and slightly boozy drink. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, the question of whether Twisted Tea contains gluten is of utmost importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of Twisted Tea, explore its gluten content, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>What is Twisted Tea?</h2>

    <p>Twisted Tea is a malt-based alcoholic beverage that is flavored with tea and natural flavors. It is known for its smooth, sweet taste and is often enjoyed as a refreshing drink during social gatherings or outdoor events. The drink typically contains around 5% alcohol by volume (ABV), making it a light and easy-to-drink option for those who prefer a milder alcoholic beverage.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is responsible for the elastic texture of dough and is commonly found in bread, pasta, and other baked goods. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and skin problems. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to carefully monitor their diet and avoid foods and beverages that contain gluten.</p>

    <h2>Does Twisted Tea Contain Gluten?</h2>

    <p>The primary concern for those with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease is whether Twisted Tea contains gluten. The answer to this question lies in the ingredients used to make Twisted Tea. Twisted Tea is a malt-based beverage, which means it is made from malted barley. Barley is a gluten-containing grain, and as a result, Twisted Tea does contain gluten.</p>

    <p>Here is a breakdown of the key ingredients in Twisted Tea and their gluten content:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten Content</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Malted Barley</td>
                <td>Contains Gluten</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Tea</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Natural Flavors</td>
                <td>Typically Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Alcohol</td>
                <td>Derived from Gluten-Containing Grains</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
