    <h1>Cantaritos Gluten Free: A Refreshing and Safe Choice</h1>

    <p>When it comes to refreshing beverages, few can rival the vibrant and zesty flavors of a Cantarito. Originating from Mexico, this traditional drink is a delightful blend of citrus juices, tequila, and a touch of salt. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying such beverages can often be a challenge. Enter Cantaritos Gluten Free—a safe and equally delicious alternative that allows everyone to indulge in this Mexican classic without worry.</p>

    <h2>What Are Cantaritos?</h2>

    <p>Cantaritos are a traditional Mexican cocktail, typically served in clay pots called "cantaritos," which give the drink its name.
