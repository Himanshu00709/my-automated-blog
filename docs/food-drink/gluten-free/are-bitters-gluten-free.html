    <h1>Are Bitters Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Bitters are a staple in many cocktails and even some culinary dishes, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether bitters are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients commonly found in bitters, how they are made, and whether they are safe for a gluten-free diet. We’ll also provide a list of popular bitters brands and their gluten-free status, along with some frequently asked questions to help you make informed choices.</p>

    <h2>What Are Bitters?</h2>

    <p>Bitters are concentrated flavor extracts made by infusing herbs, spices, roots, and other botanicals in alcohol. They are typically used in small amounts to add complexity and depth to cocktails, but they can also be used in cooking. The alcohol content in bitters is usually high, often around 40-50% ABV, which helps to extract and preserve the flavors of the botanicals.</p>

    <p>Bitters come in a variety of flavors, ranging from aromatic to citrusy, and each brand has its own unique blend of ingredients. Some of the most common ingredients include gentian root, cinchona bark, citrus peel, and various spices like cinnamon and cloves.</p>

    <h2>Are Bitters Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The gluten-free status of bitters depends on the ingredients used and the production process. The primary concern for those avoiding gluten is the base alcohol used in the bitters. Most bitters are made with a neutral grain spirit, which could be derived from gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, or rye. However, the distillation process typically removes gluten proteins, making the final product gluten-free.</p>

    <p>That said, not all bitters are created equal. Some brands may add flavorings or other ingredients after distillation that could contain gluten. Additionally, cross-contamination during production is a potential concern, especially if the same equipment is used to process gluten-containing products.</p>
