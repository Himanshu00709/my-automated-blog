<h1>Does High Noon Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>High Noon, the popular hard seltzer brand, has gained a significant following for its refreshing taste and low-calorie content. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, understanding whether High Noon contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we’ll delve into the ingredients of High Noon, its gluten content, and what you need to know if you’re following a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What is High Noon?</h2>

<p>High Noon is a brand of hard seltzer that combines real fruit juice with vodka, offering a light and refreshing alcoholic beverage. It’s known for its clean taste, low calorie count, and absence of artificial flavors or sweeteners. High Noon comes in a variety of flavors, including Pineapple, Watermelon, Black Cherry, and Lime, making it a popular choice for those looking for a healthier alternative to traditional alcoholic drinks.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. As a result, many people are vigilant about avoiding gluten in their diet, including in alcoholic beverages.</p>

<h2>Does High Noon Contain Gluten?</h2>

<p>The good news for those avoiding gluten is that High Noon is considered gluten-free. The primary ingredients in High Noon are vodka, sparkling water, and real fruit juice. Vodka, when distilled from gluten-containing grains like wheat or barley, is typically gluten-free because the distillation process removes gluten proteins. However, some individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease may still react to distilled spirits made from gluten grains.</p>

<p>High Noon uses vodka made from corn, which is naturally gluten-free. This makes High Noon a safe option for most people with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Additionally, High Noon does not contain any added gluten ingredients, further ensuring its safety for those on a gluten-free diet.</p>
