<h1>Sonic Shakes Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the general desire for healthier eating habits. Sonic Drive-In, a popular fast-food chain known for its wide array of shakes, has not been left behind in this trend. This blog post delves into the world of Sonic Shakes, focusing on their gluten-free options, ingredients, and what you need to know to enjoy a delicious, gluten-free treat.</p>
