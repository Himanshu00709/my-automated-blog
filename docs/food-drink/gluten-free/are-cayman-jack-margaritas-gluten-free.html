    <h2>Ingredients in Cayman Jack Margaritas</h2>

    <p>The first step in determining whether Cayman Jack Margaritas are gluten-free is to examine the ingredients. Here’s a list of the primary components:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Premium Spirits</td>
                <td>Typically gluten-free (distilled)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Real Lime Juice</td>
                <td>Gluten-free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Agave Nectar</td>
                <td>Gluten-free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Natural Flavors</td>
                <td>Generally gluten-free</td>

    <p>As you can see, the primary ingredients in Cayman Jack Margaritas are naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that the term “premium spirits” can sometimes be a gray area, as some spirits are derived from gluten-containing grains like barley, wheat, or rye. The good news is that the distillation process typically removes gluten proteins, making the final product gluten-free. But let’s explore this further.</p>

    <h2>Distillation and Gluten Removal</h2>

    <p>Distillation is a process that involves heating a liquid to create vapor and then cooling that vapor to produce a purified liquid. During this process, gluten proteins, which are large molecules, are left behind in the distillation residue. This means that even if a spirit is made from gluten-containing grains, the final distilled product should be gluten-free. However, cross-contamination can occur during production or bottling, so it’s essential to look for certifications or statements from the manufacturer.</p>

    <h2>Is Cayman Jack Margarita Certified Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Certification is a crucial factor for those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity. While Cayman Jack Margaritas do not carry an official gluten-free certification, the company states that their products are made with gluten-free ingredients and are processed in a way that minimizes the risk of cross-contamination. This is a positive sign, but it’s always a good idea to reach out to the manufacturer directly if you have concerns.</p>
