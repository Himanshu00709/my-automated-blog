    <h1>Gluten-Free Milk Brands: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by the increasing awareness of gluten intolerance and celiac disease. While milk is naturally gluten-free, some brands may process their products in facilities that also handle gluten-containing ingredients, leading to potential cross-contamination. For individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, choosing the right milk brand is crucial. This guide will explore the best gluten-free milk brands, their benefits, and what to look for when selecting a safe option.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Milk Gluten-Free?</h2>

Some milk brands may add flavorings, thickeners, or other additives that contain gluten. Additionally, cross-contamination can occur if the milk is processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products. Therefore, it's essential to choose brands that explicitly state their products are gluten-free and follow strict manufacturing practices to avoid cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>When selecting a gluten-free milk brand, consider the following factors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Certification:</strong> Look for brands that have been certified gluten-free by reputable organizations. This ensures that the product meets strict gluten-free standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Check the ingredient list for any hidden sources of gluten, such as flavorings or thickeners.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> Ensure that the brand follows strict manufacturing practices to avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing products.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutritional Content:</strong> Consider the nutritional profile of the milk, including its protein, calcium, and vitamin content, to ensure it meets your dietary needs.</li>
