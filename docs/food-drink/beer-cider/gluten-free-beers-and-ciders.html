<h1>Gluten-Free Beers and Ciders: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and the beverage industry is no exception. For those with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or simply a preference for gluten-free options, finding a good beer or cider can be a challenge. Fortunately, the market has responded with a variety of gluten-free beers and ciders that cater to these needs. This guide will explore the world of gluten-free beers and ciders, offering insights into their production, popular brands, and what to look for when choosing the right one for you.</p>

<h2>What Makes a Beer or Cider Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Traditional beers are made from barley, wheat, or rye, all of which contain gluten. Gluten-free beers, on the other hand, are brewed using alternative grains such as sorghum, millet, rice, or corn. Some breweries also use enzymes to break down gluten proteins in traditional grains, making the beer safe for those with gluten sensitivities. Ciders, however, are naturally gluten-free as they are made from fermented apples or other fruits, making them a safe and delicious alternative for gluten-sensitive individuals.</p>

<h2>Popular Gluten-Free Beer Brands</h2>
