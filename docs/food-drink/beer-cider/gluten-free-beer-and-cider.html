    <h1>Gluten-Free Beer and Cider: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the general trend toward healthier eating. Among the many gluten-free options available, gluten-free beer and cider have gained significant popularity. Whether you're a beer enthusiast with dietary restrictions or someone exploring new beverage options, this guide will provide you with everything you need to know about gluten-free beer and cider.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free beer is a type of beer that is brewed without gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, or rye. Traditional beer is made from these grains, which contain gluten, a protein that can cause adverse reactions in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Gluten-free beer is made using alternative grains like sorghum, millet, rice, or corn, which do not contain gluten. Some breweries also use enzymes to break down gluten in traditional beer, making it safe for those with gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Cider?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free cider, on the other hand, is naturally gluten-free as it is made from fermented apples or other fruits. Unlike beer, cider does not involve grains in its production process, making it a safe and delicious option for those avoiding gluten. Cider can range from sweet to dry, and its flavor profile can vary widely depending on the types of apples used and the fermentation process.</p>
