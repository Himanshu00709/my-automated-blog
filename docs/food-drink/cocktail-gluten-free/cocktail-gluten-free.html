    <h1>Gluten-Free Cocktails: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of cocktails can be a daunting task. Many alcoholic beverages contain gluten, either as a primary ingredient or as a result of cross-contamination during production. However, with the growing awareness of gluten-free diets, the cocktail industry has seen a surge in gluten-free options. This guide will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free cocktails, from understanding what makes a cocktail gluten-free to discovering some delicious recipes you can try at home.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Cocktail Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>A cocktail is considered gluten-free if all its ingredients, including the base spirit, mixers, and garnishes, are free from gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. Therefore, any cocktail that uses spirits or mixers derived from these grains is not gluten-free. However, many spirits, such as vodka, rum, and tequila, can be made from gluten-free ingredients like corn, potatoes, or agave, making them safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Popular Gluten-Free Spirits</h2>
    <p>When crafting a gluten-free cocktail, the choice of spirit is crucial. Here are some popular gluten-free spirits that you can use:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Spirit</th>
            <th>Gluten-Free Base</th>
            <th>Examples</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Vodka</td>
            <td>Potatoes, Corn</td>
            <td>Tito's Handmade Vodka, Chopin Potato Vodka</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Rum</td>
            <td>Sugarcane</td>
            <td>Bacardi, Captain Morgan</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Tequila</td>
            <td>Agave</td>
            <td>Patr√≥n, Don Julio</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Gin</td>
            <td>Juniper Berries, Corn</td>
            <td>Hendrick's, Bombay Sapphire</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Whiskey</td>
            <td>Corn, Rice</td>
            <td>Queen Jennie Whiskey, Koval Millet Whiskey</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Mixers and Garnishes</h2>
    <p>In addition to the base spirit, the mixers and garnishes used in a cocktail must also be gluten-free. Many mixers, such as fruit juices, sodas, and syrups, are naturally gluten-free. However, it's essential to check the labels for any hidden gluten or cross-contamination risks. Here are some common gluten-free mixers and garnishes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fruit Juices:</strong> Orange juice, cranberry juice, lime juice, and lemon juice are all naturally gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Sodas:</strong> Most sodas, including cola, ginger ale, and tonic water, are gluten-free. However, always check the label to be sure.</li>
        <li><strong>Syrups:</strong> Simple syrup, agave syrup, and flavored syrups made from gluten-free ingredients are safe to use.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnishes:</strong> Fresh fruits, herbs, and spices are excellent gluten-free garnishes. Avoid pre-made garnishes that may contain gluten.</li>
    </ul>
