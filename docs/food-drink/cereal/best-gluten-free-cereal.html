    <h2>What to Look for in a Gluten-Free Cereal</h2>

    <p>When choosing a gluten-free cereal, it’s important to consider more than just the absence of gluten. Here are some key factors to keep in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Whole Grains:</strong> Look for cereals made with whole grains like oats, quinoa, or brown rice. These grains are not only gluten-free but also rich in fiber and essential nutrients.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Sugar Content:</strong> Many cereals, even gluten-free ones, can be high in sugar. Opt for options with minimal added sugars to keep your breakfast healthy.</li>
        <li><strong>Fortified with Vitamins and Minerals:</strong> Some gluten-free cereals are fortified with additional vitamins and minerals, such as iron, calcium, and B vitamins, to help you meet your daily nutritional needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Organic and Non-GMO:</strong> If you prefer organic products, look for cereals that are certified organic and non-GMO. These options are free from synthetic pesticides and genetically modified ingredients.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cereals</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Are all oats gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>While oats are naturally gluten-free, they are often processed in facilities that also handle wheat, barley, and rye, which can lead to cross-contamination. If you have celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, look for oats that are specifically labeled as gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>2. Can gluten-free cereals help with weight loss?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cereals can be part of a healthy weight loss plan, especially if they are low in sugar and high in fiber. However, it’s important to pay attention to portion sizes and overall calorie intake.</p>

        <h3>3. Are gluten-free cereals more expensive?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cereals can be more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts due to the cost of sourcing and processing gluten-free ingredients. However, prices have become more competitive as demand has increased.</p>

        <h3>4. Can children eat gluten-free cereals?</h3>
        <p>Yes, many gluten-free cereals are suitable for children. Brands like EnviroKidz offer gluten-free options that are specifically designed to be kid-friendly, with fun shapes and flavors that appeal to younger palates.</p>
