    <h1>Gluten-Free Beer Subscription: A Guide for Beer Enthusiasts</h1>

    <p>For beer lovers who follow a gluten-free diet, finding a delicious and satisfying brew can be a challenge.

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free beer is brewed without the use of gluten-containing grains like barley, wheat, or rye. Instead, brewers use alternative grains such as sorghum, millet, rice, or corn to create a beer that is safe for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. These beers are crafted to mimic the flavor and texture of traditional beers, offering a wide range of styles from lagers to IPAs.</p>
