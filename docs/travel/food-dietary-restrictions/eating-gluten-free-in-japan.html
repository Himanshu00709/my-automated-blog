    <h1>Eating Gluten-Free in Japan: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Japan is a country renowned for its rich culinary traditions, from sushi and ramen to tempura and okonomiyaki. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, navigating Japanese cuisine can be a challenge. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, is prevalent in many Japanese dishes. But fear not! With a little knowledge and preparation, you can enjoy a gluten-free experience in Japan without compromising on taste or tradition.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten in Japanese Cuisine</h2>

    <p>Before diving into the specifics of eating gluten-free in Japan, it's essential to understand where gluten is commonly found in Japanese cuisine. Wheat flour is a staple in many traditional dishes, and soy sauce, a ubiquitous condiment, typically contains wheat. Here are some common Japanese foods that often contain gluten:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Food Item</th>
                <th>Gluten Content</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Soy Sauce</td>
                <td>Contains wheat</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Ramen</td>
                <td>Made with wheat noodles</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Udon</td>
                <td>Thick wheat noodles</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Tempura</td>
                <td>Battered with wheat flour</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Okonomiyaki</td>
                <td>Contains wheat flour</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>While this list may seem daunting, there are plenty of gluten-free options available in Japan. The key is to know what to look for and how to communicate your dietary needs effectively.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives in Japan</h2>

    <p>Fortunately, Japan has seen a growing awareness of gluten-free diets in recent years, and many restaurants and stores now offer gluten-free options. Here are some gluten-free alternatives to popular Japanese dishes:</p>

    <table>

                <th>Traditional Dish</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Alternative</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>

                <td>Tamari (gluten-free soy sauce)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Ramen</td>
                <td>Shirataki noodles or rice noodles</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Udon</td>
                <td>Konjac noodles or rice noodles</td>
            </tr>
