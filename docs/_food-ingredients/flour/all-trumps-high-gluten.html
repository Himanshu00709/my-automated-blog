        <li><strong>Superior Elasticity:</strong> The high gluten content allows the dough to stretch without tearing, which is crucial for thin-crust pizzas and artisan bread.</li>
        <li><strong>Excellent Rise:</strong> The strong gluten network traps gas produced by yeast, resulting in a better rise and a lighter, airier texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chewy Texture:</strong> High gluten flour creates a chewy texture that is highly desirable in bagels, pizza crusts, and certain types of bread.</li>

    <h2>How to Use All Trumps High Gluten Flour</h2>

    <p>Using All Trumps High Gluten Flour is similar to using other types of flour, but there are a few tips to keep in mind to get the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> High gluten flour absorbs more water than lower-protein flours. Be prepared to adjust the hydration level of your dough to achieve the desired consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Kneading:</strong> Proper kneading is essential to develop the gluten network. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>Resting:</strong> Allow the dough to rest and rise adequately. This gives the gluten time to relax and the yeast time to ferment, which enhances the flavor and texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking:</strong> High gluten flour is ideal for high-temperature baking, such as in pizza ovens. The strong gluten structure can withstand the heat without collapsing.</li>
    </ol>
