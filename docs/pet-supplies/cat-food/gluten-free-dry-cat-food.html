        <li><strong>Healthier Skin and Coat:</strong> Gluten-free diets can reduce skin irritations and promote a shinier, healthier coat.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight Management:</strong> Gluten-free cat foods often contain higher protein and lower carbohydrate content, aiding in weight management.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Allergic Reactions:</strong> Eliminating gluten can help reduce allergic reactions, leading to a happier and more comfortable cat.</li>
