    <h1>Gluten-Free Dog Treats: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>As pet owners, we always want the best for our furry friends. One of the most important aspects of pet care is their diet, and this includes the treats we give them. In recent years, gluten-free dog treats have gained popularity due to their potential health benefits. But what exactly are gluten-free dog treats, and why should you consider them for your pet?

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Dog Treats?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free dog treats are snacks made without gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.

        <li><strong>Reduced Allergic Reactions:</strong> Some dogs may develop skin irritations, itching, or other allergic reactions due to gluten. Switching to gluten-free treats can help reduce these symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Overall Health:</strong> Gluten-free treats often contain higher-quality ingredients, which can contribute to your dog’s overall health and well-being.</li>
