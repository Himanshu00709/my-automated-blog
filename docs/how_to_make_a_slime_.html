    <h1>How to Make Slime: A Fun and Easy Guide</h1>
    <p>Slime has become a popular DIY project for kids and adults alike. It's not only fun to play with but also a great way to explore science and creativity. In this blog post, we'll walk you through the steps to make your own slime at home. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned slime enthusiast, this guide has something for everyone!</p>

    <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
    <p>Before you start, gather the following materials:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>White school glue (1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>Water (1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>Baking soda (1/2 teaspoon)</li>
        <li>Contact lens solution (1 tablespoon)</li>
        <li>Food coloring (optional)</li>
        <li>Glitter or other add-ins (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your own slime:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix the Glue and Water:</strong> In a bowl, combine 1/2 cup of white school glue with 1/2 cup of water. Stir until the mixture is smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Food Coloring:</strong> If you want colored slime, add a few drops of food coloring to the mixture and stir until the color is evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Baking Soda:</strong> Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda into the mixture and stir well. This will help thicken the slime.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Contact Lens Solution:</strong> Slowly add 1 tablespoon of contact lens solution to the mixture while stirring. The slime will begin to form and pull away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the Slime:</strong> Once the slime has formed, take it out of the bowl and knead it with your hands until it reaches the desired consistency. If it's too sticky, add a little more contact lens solution.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Glitter or Other Add-Ins:</strong> If you want to add glitter, beads, or other fun items, mix them in during this step.</li>
