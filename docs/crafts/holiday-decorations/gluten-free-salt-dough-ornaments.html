    <h1>Gluten-Free Salt Dough Ornaments: A Complete Guide</h1>

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about creating beautiful, safe, and festive gluten-free salt dough ornaments.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Salt Dough?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free salt dough is an excellent alternative for individuals who need to avoid gluten. Traditional salt dough recipes typically call for wheat flour, which contains gluten. For those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, even small amounts of gluten can cause severe health issues. By using gluten-free flour, you can enjoy the same fun and creativity of salt dough ornaments without the risk.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Salt Dough</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free salt dough is incredibly simple and requires only a few basic ingredients. Here’s what you’ll need:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Quantity</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>

                <td>Fine table salt works best.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Water</td>
                <td>1 cup</td>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these easy steps to create your gluten-free salt dough ornaments:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix the Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour and salt. Gradually add water while stirring until the dough comes together. The dough should be firm but pliable.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) and knead it for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Use a rolling pin to roll the dough to your desired thickness, typically around 1/4 inch.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut Out Shapes:</strong> Use cookie cutters or a knife to cut out your desired shapes. Be creative with holiday-themed designs like stars, trees, or snowflakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Create Holes for Hanging:</strong> Use a straw or skewer to make a small hole at the top of each ornament for hanging.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 250°F (120°C). Place the ornaments on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 2-3 hours, or until completely dry and hard.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Decorate:</strong> Allow the ornaments to cool completely before painting or decorating with acrylic paints, glitter, or markers.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free salt dough ornaments turn out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a 1:1 Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> These blends are designed to mimic the texture of wheat flour and will give you the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overbake:</strong> Keep an eye on your ornaments while they bake. Overbaking can cause them to brown or crack.</li>
        <li><strong>Seal Your Ornaments:</strong> Once decorated, consider sealing your ornaments with a clear varnish or Mod Podge to protect them from moisture and extend their lifespan.</li>
    </ul>
