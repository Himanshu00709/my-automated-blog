    <h2>Production Process of Gluten-Free Pasta</h2>

    <p>The production of gluten-free pasta involves several key steps to ensure the final product is safe, nutritious, and delicious. Here’s an overview of the typical process:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Ingredient Selection:</strong> High-quality gluten-free flours such as rice, corn, quinoa, or legumes are carefully selected. These ingredients are often sourced from certified gluten-free facilities to prevent cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Mixing and Kneading:</strong> The selected flours are mixed with water and other ingredients (such as xanthan gum or guar gum) to create a dough. This step is crucial for achieving the desired texture and consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Extrusion:</strong> The dough is then extruded through molds to create various pasta shapes. The extrusion process is carefully controlled to ensure uniformity and quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Drying:</strong> The pasta is dried at low temperatures to preserve its nutritional value and prevent cracking or breaking. This step also extends the shelf life of the product.</li>
        <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> Finally, the pasta is packaged in airtight containers to maintain freshness and prevent contamination. Many manufacturers use eco-friendly packaging materials to reduce their environmental impact.</li>
