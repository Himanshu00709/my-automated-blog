    <h1>Does Bob Evans Have Gluten-Free Options? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining</h2>

    <p>Before diving into Bob Evans’ menu, it’s important to understand what gluten-free means. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.

Therefore, gluten-free dining is not just a preference but a necessity for many.</p>

    <p>When dining out, it’s essential to ensure that the restaurant not only offers gluten-free options but also takes precautions to avoid cross-contamination. Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods or surfaces, rendering them unsafe for those with gluten-related disorders.</p>
