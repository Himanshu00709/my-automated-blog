    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks at Carl's Jr</h2>

    <p>Cross-contamination is a significant concern for those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity.

    <p>To reduce the risk of cross-contamination, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Communicate Clearly:</strong> Inform the staff about your gluten-free needs and ask them to take extra precautions when preparing your food.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Simple Items:</strong> Opt for menu items that are less likely to come into contact with gluten, such as a charbroiled burger without the bun.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Shared Fryers:</strong> If you’re highly sensitive, it’s best to avoid items like French fries that are cooked in shared fryers.</li>
    </ul>
