    <h1>How to Cook Pasta: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
    <p>Pasta is one of the most versatile and beloved dishes in the world. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned chef, mastering the art of cooking pasta is a skill that will serve you well in the kitchen. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of cooking pasta perfectly, from boiling the water to serving it with your favorite sauce.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Choose the Right Pasta</h2>
    <p>There are countless types of pasta, each with its own unique shape and texture. Some popular options include spaghetti, penne, fettuccine, and farfalle. The type of pasta you choose will depend on the dish you're making and the sauce you plan to use. For example, long, thin pasta like spaghetti pairs well with light, oil-based sauces, while thicker pasta like penne is great for hearty, chunky sauces.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Boil the Water</h2>
    <p>Fill a large pot with waterâ€”about 4 to 6 quarts for every pound of pasta. Add a generous amount of salt to the water (about 1-2 tablespoons). The salt enhances the flavor of the pasta, so don't skip this step! Bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Cook the Pasta</h2>
    <p>Once the water is boiling, add the pasta. Stir immediately to prevent the pasta from sticking together. Follow the cooking time indicated on the pasta package, but start tasting the pasta a minute or two before the suggested time to ensure it's cooked to your preferred level of doneness. Pasta should be <em>al dente</em>, which means it should be tender but still have a slight bite to it.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Drain and Serve</h2>
    <p>When the pasta is done, drain it in a colander. Do not rinse the pasta unless you're making a cold pasta salad, as rinsing removes the starch that helps the sauce cling to the pasta. Immediately toss the pasta with your favorite sauce and serve hot.</p>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <p><strong>Q: How much salt should I add to the pasta water?</strong></p>
        <p>A: A good rule of thumb is to add 1-2 tablespoons of salt for every 4-6 quarts of water. This will enhance the flavor of the pasta without making it too salty.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can I cook pasta without boiling water?</strong></p>
        <p>A: While boiling water is the traditional method, you can also cook pasta in a skillet with just enough water to cover it. This method is quicker and uses less water, but it requires more attention to prevent sticking.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How do I know when the pasta is done?</strong></p>
        <p>A: The best way to check if pasta is done is to taste it. It should be tender but still have a slight bite to it, known as <em>al dente</em>. Avoid overcooking, as this can make the pasta mushy.</p>
