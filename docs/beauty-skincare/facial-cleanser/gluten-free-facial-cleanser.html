    <h1>Gluten-Free Facial Cleanser: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, not just in the food industry but also in the beauty and skincare sector. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, even topical exposure to gluten can cause adverse reactions. This has led to the rise of gluten-free facial cleansers, which are specifically formulated to be safe for those who need to avoid gluten in their skincare routine. In this article, we will explore the benefits of gluten-free facial cleansers, how to choose the right one, and why they might be a game-changer for your skincare regimen.</p>

    <h2>What is a Gluten-Free Facial Cleanser?</h2>

    <p>A gluten-free facial cleanser is a skincare product that is formulated without any ingredients derived from wheat, barley, rye, or other gluten-containing grains.
