    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Sourdough Bread?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free sourdough bread is a type of bread made without gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, or rye. Instead, it uses gluten-free flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or buckwheat flour. The sourdough process involves fermenting the dough using naturally occurring lactobacilli and wild yeast, which gives the bread its characteristic tangy flavor and chewy texture. This fermentation process also breaks down some of the starches and proteins, making the bread easier to digest and potentially more nutritious.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free sourdough bread offers several health benefits, making it an excellent choice for those with gluten sensitivities or anyone looking to improve their diet. Here are some of the key benefits:</p>
