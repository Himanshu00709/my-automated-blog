<h2>Tips for Making Your Own Gluten-Free Scones</h2>

<p>If you're feeling adventurous, why not try making your own gluten-free scones at home? Here are some tips to get you started:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> A blend of gluten-free flours works best for scones. Common options include almond flour, rice flour, and tapioca flour.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Binders:</strong> Since gluten-free flours lack the binding properties of wheat flour, you may need to add xanthan gum or psyllium husk to help hold the dough together.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough scones. Mix the dough just until it comes together, then gently shape it into rounds.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free scones are incredibly versatile. Try adding fresh berries, chocolate chips, or even herbs and cheese for a savory twist.</li>
</ul>
