    <h1>Are Tootsie Rolls Gluten and Dairy Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Tootsie Rolls have been a beloved treat for generations, offering a unique chewy texture and a rich chocolate flavor. However, for individuals with dietary restrictions, such as those who need to avoid gluten or dairy, the question arises: Are Tootsie Rolls gluten and dairy free? In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of Tootsie Rolls, explore their suitability for gluten-free and dairy-free diets, and provide answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Dairy-Free Diets</h2>

    <p>Before we dive into the specifics of Tootsie Rolls, it's important to understand what it means for a product to be gluten-free or dairy-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Dairy, on the other hand, refers to products derived from milk, which can be problematic for those who are lactose intolerant or have a milk allergy.</p>

    <p>For a product to be considered gluten-free, it must not contain any gluten-containing ingredients and must be processed in a way that avoids cross-contamination with gluten. Similarly, a dairy-free product must not contain any milk-derived ingredients and should be free from cross-contamination with dairy products.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Tootsie Rolls</h2>

    <p>Tootsie Rolls are made from a combination of sugar, corn syrup, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, condensed skim milk, cocoa, whey, soy lecithin, and artificial and natural flavors. Let's break down these ingredients to determine whether Tootsie Rolls are gluten and dairy free.</p>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Soy Lecithin</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
