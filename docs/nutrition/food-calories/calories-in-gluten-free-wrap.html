    <li><strong>Low in Carbohydrates:</strong> Compared to traditional wheat-based wraps, gluten-free wraps made from almond or coconut flour are often lower in carbohydrates, making them suitable for low-carb diets.</li>
    <li><strong>Gluten-Free:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, gluten-free wraps are a safe and convenient option that allows them to enjoy a variety of meals without the risk of gluten exposure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for Choosing Healthier Gluten-Free Wraps</h2>

<ol>
