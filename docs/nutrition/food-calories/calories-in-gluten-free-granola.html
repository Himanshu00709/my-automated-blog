<h1>Calories in Gluten-Free Granola: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Granola has long been a popular breakfast choice for health-conscious individuals, offering a delicious and convenient way to start the day. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding the right granola can be a bit more challenging. Gluten-free granola is not only a great option for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but it can also be a nutritious choice for anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake. But how do the calories in gluten-free granola compare to traditional granola? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the calorie content of gluten-free granola, its nutritional benefits, and how to make the best choice for your dietary needs.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Granola</h2>

This makes it a safe and delicious option for those who need to avoid gluten. However, just because it’s gluten-free doesn’t necessarily mean it’s low in calories. In fact, gluten-free granola can be just as calorie-dense as its traditional counterpart, depending on the ingredients used.</p>

On average, a 1/4 cup serving of gluten-free granola contains between 120 and 150 calories. However, some brands may have higher calorie counts due to added sugars, oils, or nuts. To give you a better idea, here’s a table comparing the calorie content of popular gluten-free granola brands:</p>
