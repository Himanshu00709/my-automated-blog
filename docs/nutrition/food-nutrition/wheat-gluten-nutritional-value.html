    <h2>FAQs About Wheat Gluten</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Is wheat gluten safe for people with celiac disease?</h3>
        <p>No, wheat gluten is not safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten, which is found in wheat, barley, and rye. Consuming wheat gluten can lead to severe health issues for those with celiac disease, including intestinal damage and nutrient malabsorption.</p>

        <h3>2. Can wheat gluten help with weight loss?</h3>
        <p>Wheat gluten can be a helpful addition to a weight loss diet due to its high protein and low-fat content. Protein is known to promote satiety, which can help reduce overall calorie intake. However, it's essential to consume wheat gluten as part of a balanced diet and not rely solely on it for weight loss.</p>

        <h3>3. How does wheat gluten compare to soy protein?</h3>
        <p>Wheat gluten and soy protein are both excellent plant-based protein sources, but they differ in their nutritional profiles. Wheat gluten is higher in protein and lower in fat compared to soy protein. However, soy protein contains all essential amino acids, making it a complete protein, whereas wheat gluten is low in lysine, an essential amino acid. Therefore, it's essential to combine wheat gluten with other protein sources to ensure a complete amino acid profile.</p>

        <h3>4. Can wheat gluten be used in baking?</h3>
        <p>Yes, wheat gluten is often used in baking to improve the texture and elasticity of bread and other baked goods. It is commonly added to whole-grain flours to enhance the dough's strength and rise. However, it should be used in moderation, as excessive amounts can make baked goods too dense and chewy.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Wheat gluten is a highly nutritious and versatile protein source that offers numerous health benefits. Its high protein content, low fat, and rich mineral profile make it an excellent choice for vegetarians, vegans, and anyone looking to increase their protein intake. While it may not be suitable for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can be a valuable addition to a balanced diet for others. Whether used in stir-fries, stews, or baked goods, wheat gluten provides a nutritious and delicious alternative to meat and other protein sources.</p>
