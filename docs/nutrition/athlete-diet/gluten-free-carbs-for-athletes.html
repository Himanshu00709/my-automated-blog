    <h1>Gluten-Free Carbs for Athletes: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For athletes, carbohydrates are the primary source of energy, fueling everything from high-intensity sprints to endurance events. However, for those with gluten intolerance, celiac disease, or those simply choosing a gluten-free lifestyle, finding the right sources of carbs can be challenging. This guide will explore the best gluten-free carbohydrate options for athletes, ensuring you can maintain peak performance without compromising your dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>Why Carbohydrates Are Essential for Athletes</h2>

    <p>Carbohydrates are the body's preferred energy source, especially during high-intensity and prolonged exercise. They are broken down into glucose, which is stored in the muscles and liver as glycogen. During exercise, glycogen is converted back into glucose to provide energy. Without adequate carbohydrate intake, athletes may experience fatigue, decreased performance, and slower recovery times.</p>

    <p>For gluten-free athletes, it's crucial to identify carbohydrate-rich foods that are naturally free of gluten. Fortunately, there are plenty of options available that can meet the energy demands of even the most active individuals.</p>

    <h2>Top Gluten-Free Carbohydrate Sources for Athletes</h2>
