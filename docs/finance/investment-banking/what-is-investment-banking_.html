    <h1>What is Investment Banking? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Investment banking is a specialized segment of banking that focuses on helping individuals, corporations, and governments raise capital and provide financial advisory services. It plays a crucial role in the global economy by facilitating large-scale financial transactions, mergers, and acquisitions.
