    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cake bakes evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Cake Pan</h3>
    <p>Grease your cake pan with butter or cooking spray, then dust it with flour to prevent the cake from sticking. You can also line the bottom with parchment paper for easier removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. This helps to evenly distribute the leavening agents and ensures a uniform texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. This process incorporates air into the mixture, which helps the cake rise.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined; overmixing can lead to a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Decorate</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can frost and decorate the cake as desired.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use cake flour for a lighter texture, or whole wheat flour for a denser, healthier option. However, the texture and taste may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute butter with oil?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use an equal amount of vegetable oil instead of butter. This will result in a moister cake, but the flavor will be slightly different.</p>

        <h3>How do I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Making a cake from scratch is a fun and rewarding process that allows you to create something delicious and personalized. By following these steps, you'll be able to bake a cake that's perfect for any occasion. Happy baking!</p>
