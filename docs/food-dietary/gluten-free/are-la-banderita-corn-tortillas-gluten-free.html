    <h1>Are La Banderita Corn Tortillas Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. For those who must avoid gluten, finding safe and delicious food options is essential. One common question that arises is whether La Banderita corn tortillas are gluten-free. In this article, we will delve into the details, examining the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential cross-contamination risks associated with La Banderita corn tortillas.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to various health issues. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten can cause discomfort and digestive problems. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to ensure that the foods they consume are free from gluten.</p>

    <h2>What Are La Banderita Corn Tortillas?</h2>

    <p>La Banderita is a well-known brand that offers a variety of tortilla products, including corn tortillas. Corn tortillas are a staple in Mexican cuisine and are traditionally made from masa harina, a type of corn flour. Unlike wheat tortillas, corn tortillas are naturally gluten-free, making them a popular choice for those on a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in La Banderita Corn Tortillas</h2>

    <p>To determine whether La Banderita corn tortillas are gluten-free, it is essential to examine their ingredients. According to the product packaging, the primary ingredients in La Banderita corn tortillas are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Corn masa flour</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Cellulose gum</li>
        <li>Propionic acid</li>
        <li>Benzoic acid</li>
        <li>Phosphoric acid</li>
        <li>Guar gum</li>
        <li>Enzymes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>None of these ingredients contain gluten, which is a positive sign. However, it is also important to consider the manufacturing process and the potential for cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if a product's ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can introduce gluten. This is particularly concerning for individuals with celiac disease, who must avoid even trace amounts of gluten. La Banderita corn tortillas are produced in facilities that also handle wheat products, which raises the possibility of cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>To address this concern, La Banderita provides information on their packaging regarding potential allergens. While they do not explicitly state that their corn tortillas are gluten-free, they do indicate that the product contains no wheat ingredients. However, the risk of cross-contamination cannot be entirely ruled out.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

    <p>One way to ensure that a product is safe for those with celiac disease is to look for gluten-free certification. Certified gluten-free products have undergone rigorous testing to confirm that they contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most individuals with celiac disease.</p>

    <p>As of the time of writing, La Banderita corn tortillas do not carry a gluten-free certification. This lack of certification means that while the ingredients are gluten-free, the product has not been officially tested to confirm its gluten-free status.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Information</h2>

    <p>For those who are health-conscious, understanding the nutritional profile of La Banderita corn tortillas is also important. Below is a table summarizing the nutritional information per serving (one tortilla):</p>
