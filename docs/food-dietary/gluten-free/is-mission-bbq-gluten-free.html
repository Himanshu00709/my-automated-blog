Therefore, it’s crucial for those affected to carefully scrutinize their food choices, especially when dining out.</p>

<p>Mission BBQ, like many restaurants, offers a variety of dishes that may or may not contain gluten. While they don’t have a dedicated gluten-free menu, they do provide information about their ingredients and preparation methods, which can help you make informed decisions.</p>

<h3>Sauces and Seasonings</h3>

<p>One of the highlights of Mission BBQ is its array of sauces and seasonings. However, not all of them are gluten-free. Here’s a quick guide to help you navigate:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Texas Twang:</strong> Gluten-free</li>
    <li><strong>KC Classic:</strong> Contains gluten</li>

</ul>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> Don’t hesitate to ask the staff about ingredients and preparation methods.</li>
    <li><strong>Stick to Simple Dishes:</strong> Opt for plain meats and sides without sauces or seasonings that may contain gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid Fried Foods:</strong> Fried items are often cooked in shared fryers, which can be a source of cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Bring Your Own Sauce:</strong> If you’re unsure about the sauces available, consider bringing your own gluten-free sauce.</li>
</ol>
