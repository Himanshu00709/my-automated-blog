    <h1>Are Moe's Tortilla Chips Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>When it comes to enjoying a delicious meal at Moe's Southwest Grill, one of the most popular side items is their tortilla chips. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Moe's tortilla chips are gluten-free is of utmost importance. In this article, we'll dive deep into the ingredients, preparation methods, and potential cross-contamination risks to provide you with a clear answer.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it's crucial for those affected to be vigilant about the foods they consume, including snacks like tortilla chips.</p>

    <h2>Are Moe's Tortilla Chips Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Moe's Southwest Grill is known for its commitment to providing fresh and customizable meals. According to Moe's official allergen information, their tortilla chips are made from corn, which is naturally gluten-free. However, it's essential to consider the preparation process and potential cross-contamination risks.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients in Moe's Tortilla Chips</h3>

    <p>The primary ingredients in Moe's tortilla chips are corn masa flour, water, and a small amount of lime. These ingredients are inherently gluten-free. However, it's always a good idea to check for any additional seasonings or flavorings that might contain gluten.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Corn Masa Flour</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Water</td>

        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Preparation and Cross-Contamination Risks</h3>

For example, if the chips are fried in the same oil as gluten-containing items, there's a risk of gluten exposure. Moe's does not specifically state that their frying oil is dedicated solely to gluten-free items, so this is something to be aware of.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the chips are often served with dips and salsas, some of which may contain gluten. It's important to inquire about the ingredients in these accompaniments to ensure they are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>
