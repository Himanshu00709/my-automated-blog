    <p>For those who follow a gluten-free diet, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield.

One such place that has gained popularity among gluten-free diners is the Rib Crib.

Therefore, gluten-free dining requires careful attention to ingredients, preparation methods, and cross-contamination risks.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Concerns</h2>

Fortunately, Rib Crib offers a selection of gluten-free sauces that you can enjoy with your meal. Below is a list of gluten-free sauces available at Rib Crib:</p>

        <li><strong>Mustard BBQ Sauce:</strong> A tangy mustard-based sauce that pairs well with pork and chicken.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Always double-check with your server to confirm that the sauces are gluten-free, as recipes can change over time.</p>
