For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and long-term health complications. Therefore, it is essential to scrutinize food labels and understand the manufacturing processes of products to ensure they are gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Knorr Caldo de Pollo</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Knorr Caldo de Pollo is gluten-free, we must first examine its ingredients. The primary ingredients in Knorr Caldo de Pollo include:</p>

                <th>Source</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>Mineral</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)</td>
                <td>Chemical compound</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Hydrolyzed Soy Protein</td>
                <td>Soybeans</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Chicken Fat</td>
                <td>Animal source</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Yeast Extract</td>
                <td>Yeast</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>Various sources</td>
                <td>May contain gluten</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>Various sources</td>
                <td>May contain gluten</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>While most of the ingredients in Knorr Caldo de Pollo are inherently gluten-free, the inclusion of "natural flavors" and "spices" introduces some uncertainty. These ingredients can sometimes contain gluten, depending on their source and the manufacturing process.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if a product's ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can pose a risk. Knorr, like many food manufacturers, produces a variety of products, some of which may contain gluten. Shared equipment or facilities can lead to trace amounts of gluten ending up in otherwise gluten-free products.</p>

    <p>Knorr does not explicitly label their Caldo de Pollo as gluten-free, which suggests that there may be a risk of cross-contamination. For individuals with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease, this lack of a gluten-free certification is a red flag.</p>

    <h2>Knorr's Stance on Gluten-Free Products</h2>

    <p>Knorr has a range of products, some of which are labeled as gluten-free. However, the Caldo de Pollo product line is not among them. The company advises consumers to check the product packaging for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding gluten content. If you are highly sensitive to gluten, it may be best to avoid Knorr Caldo de Pollo or contact the manufacturer directly for more detailed information.</p>

    <h2>Alternatives to Knorr Caldo de Pollo</h2>

    <p>If you are looking for a gluten-free alternative to Knorr Caldo de Pollo, there are several options available on the market. Many brands offer gluten-free bouillon cubes and powders that can be used in place of Knorr Caldo de Pollo. Some popular gluten-free brands include:</p>

    <ul>
