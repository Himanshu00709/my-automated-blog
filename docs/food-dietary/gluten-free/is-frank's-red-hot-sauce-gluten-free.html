    <h1>Is Frank's RedHot Sauce Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>
    <p>Frank's RedHot Sauce has been a staple in kitchens for decades, known for its perfect balance of heat and flavor. Whether you're drizzling it over wings, mixing it into dips, or adding a kick to your favorite recipes, Frank's RedHot is a go-to condiment for many. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question remains: Is Frank's RedHot Sauce gluten-free? In this article, we'll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to provide a comprehensive answer.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. As a result, many people are vigilant about checking food labels and ensuring that their favorite products are gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Frank's RedHot Sauce Ingredients</h2>
    <p>To determine whether Frank's RedHot Sauce is gluten-free, let's first examine its ingredients. The classic Frank's RedHot Original Cayenne Pepper Sauce contains the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Aged Cayenne Red Peppers</li>
        <li>Distilled Vinegar</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
    </ul>
    <p>None of these ingredients inherently contain gluten. However, it's essential to consider cross-contamination during manufacturing, which we'll discuss later.</p>

    <h2>Is Frank's RedHot Sauce Certified Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Frank's RedHot Sauce is not certified gluten-free by a third-party organization. However, the company states that their Original RedHot Sauce does not contain gluten ingredients. This is a crucial distinction. While the product may not have gluten-containing ingredients, the lack of certification means there's no guarantee against cross-contamination during production.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Concerns</h2>
    <p>Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free products are manufactured in facilities that also process gluten-containing ingredients. Frank's RedHot Sauce is produced in facilities that handle other products, some of which may contain gluten. While the company follows strict cleaning protocols, the risk of cross-contamination cannot be entirely ruled out.</p>

    <h2>Frank's RedHot Sauce Varieties</h2>
    <p>Frank's RedHot offers a variety of sauces, and while the Original RedHot Sauce is considered gluten-free, some of the other flavors may contain gluten or be at higher risk of cross-contamination. Below is a table summarizing the gluten-free status of popular Frank's RedHot varieties:</p>
