The Old Spaghetti Factory, a popular chain known for its hearty Italian-American cuisine, has been a go-to spot for many families. But does it cater to those who need gluten-free options? In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free offerings at The Old Spaghetti Factory, how they handle cross-contamination, and what you can expect when dining there.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining</h2>

    <p>Before diving into the specifics of The Old Spaghetti Factory’s menu, it’s important to understand what gluten-free dining entails. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, gluten-free dining isn’t just about avoiding certain foods—it’s also about ensuring that meals are prepared in a way that prevents cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Options at The Old Spaghetti Factory</h2>

    <p>The Old Spaghetti Factory has made efforts to accommodate gluten-free diners. While their menu is primarily centered around pasta dishes, which traditionally contain gluten, they do offer gluten-free pasta options. Here’s a breakdown of what you can expect:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Menu Item</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Option</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>

                <td>Spaghetti with Mizithra Cheese</td>
                <td>Yes</td>

                <td>Gluten-free pasta available; sauce is gluten-free.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Concerns</h2>

    <p>One of the biggest concerns for gluten-free diners is cross-contamination. Even if a dish is made with gluten-free ingredients, it can still come into contact with gluten during preparation. The Old Spaghetti Factory acknowledges this concern and takes steps to minimize the risk. However, they do not have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen, so there is always a possibility of cross-contamination.</p>

They may be able to take extra precautions, such as using separate utensils or preparing your meal in a less contaminated area of the kitchen. However, it’s important to note that The Old Spaghetti Factory cannot guarantee a completely gluten-free environment.</p>

        <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> Don’t hesitate to ask about ingredients and preparation methods. The staff is generally knowledgeable and willing to assist.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Cautious with Sauces:</strong> While many sauces are gluten-free, some may contain hidden gluten. Always double-check with your server.</li>
