    <h1>Hotpot Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Hotpot, a beloved communal dining experience, has been a staple in many cultures for centuries. Originating from East Asia, this interactive meal involves cooking a variety of ingredients in a simmering pot of broth at the center of the table. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying hotpot can be a challenge. This guide will explore how to enjoy a gluten-free hotpot experience, from selecting the right ingredients to preparing a safe and delicious meal.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that all components of a hotpot meal are gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Choosing Gluten-Free Broth</h2>

    <p>The foundation of any hotpot is the broth. Traditional broths may contain gluten due to the use of soy sauce, miso, or other flavorings. Here are some gluten-free broth options:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Broth Type</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Chicken Broth</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
                <td>Ensure no gluten-containing additives are used.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vegetable Broth</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>

                <td>Some miso pastes contain barley; opt for gluten-free miso.</td>
