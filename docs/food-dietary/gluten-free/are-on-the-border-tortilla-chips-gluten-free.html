    <h1>Are On The Border Tortilla Chips Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding safe and delicious snack options can be a challenge. One popular snack that often comes into question is tortilla chips. Specifically, many people wonder: <strong>Are On The Border tortilla chips gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to provide a comprehensive answer to this question.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it’s crucial for these individuals to ensure that the foods they consume are free from gluten contamination.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in On The Border Tortilla Chips</h2>

    <p>To determine whether On The Border tortilla chips are gluten-free, we first need to examine their ingredients. The primary ingredients in most tortilla chips include corn, oil, and salt. However, some brands may add additional flavorings or preservatives that could contain gluten.</p>

    <p>Here’s a breakdown of the ingredients typically found in On The Border tortilla chips:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Potential Gluten Content</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Corn</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vegetable Oil</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Natural Flavors</td>
                <td>May Contain Gluten</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As you can see, the main ingredients are naturally gluten-free. However, the inclusion of "natural flavors" raises a red flag, as these can sometimes contain gluten. To be certain, it’s essential to look for additional information from the manufacturer.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can introduce gluten into the product. This is particularly concerning for individuals with celiac disease, who must avoid even trace amounts of gluten.</p>

    <p>On The Border tortilla chips are produced in facilities that may also process wheat-containing products. This increases the risk of cross-contamination. However, the company may have protocols in place to minimize this risk, such as dedicated production lines or thorough cleaning procedures.</p>

    <h2>Certifications and Labeling</h2>

    <p>One way to ensure that a product is gluten-free is to look for certifications from reputable organizations. These certifications indicate that the product has been tested and meets strict gluten-free standards.</p>

    <p>On The Border tortilla chips do not currently carry a gluten-free certification from organizations such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO) or the Celiac Support Association (CSA). However, the absence of certification does not necessarily mean the product contains gluten. It simply means that the product has not been formally tested and certified by these organizations.</p>

    <h2>Consumer Experiences and Reviews</h2>

    <p>Many consumers with gluten sensitivities have reported consuming On The Border tortilla chips without experiencing adverse reactions. However, individual tolerance levels can vary, and what works for one person may not work for another. It’s always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional if you’re unsure about a product’s safety.</p>
