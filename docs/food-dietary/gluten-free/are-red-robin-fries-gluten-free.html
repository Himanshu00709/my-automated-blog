<h1>Are Red Robin Fries Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>When it comes to dining out with dietary restrictions, one of the most common questions is whether certain menu items are gluten-free. For those who love Red Robin's famous bottomless fries, the question is particularly pressing: <strong>Are Red Robin fries gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, preparation methods, and potential cross-contamination risks associated with Red Robin fries to help you make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial for those with gluten-related disorders to be vigilant about the foods they consume, especially when dining out.</p>

<h2>Red Robin Fries: Ingredients and Preparation</h2>

<p>Red Robin is known for its bottomless steak fries, which are a favorite among many diners. But are these fries safe for those avoiding gluten? Let’s break down the ingredients and preparation process:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Component</th>
            <th>Details</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Potatoes</td>
            <td>Red Robin fries are made from whole potatoes, which are naturally gluten-free.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Oil</td>
            <td>The fries are cooked in soybean oil, which is also gluten-free.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Seasoning</td>
            <td>Red Robin uses a proprietary seasoning blend on their fries. While the exact ingredients are not disclosed, the company states that the seasoning does not contain gluten.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Preparation</td>
            <td>Fries are typically cooked in a dedicated fryer, but cross-contamination can occur if the same fryer is used for gluten-containing items.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

<p>While the ingredients in Red Robin fries are gluten-free, the risk of cross-contamination is a significant concern. Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free foods come into contact with surfaces, utensils, or fryers that have been used to prepare gluten-containing foods. At Red Robin, the fries are cooked in the same fryers as other items that may contain gluten, such as onion rings or breaded chicken tenders. This means that even though the fries themselves are gluten-free, they may not be safe for individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity.</p>
