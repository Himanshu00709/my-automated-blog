<h1>Is Ghirardelli Caramel Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, determining whether a product is gluten-free is crucial.

For people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and long-term complications. Therefore, it’s essential to scrutinize food labels and understand the manufacturing processes of the products you consume.</p>

<p>As you can see, the primary ingredients in Ghirardelli caramel products are naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing, especially if the same equipment is used to process gluten-containing products.</p>

<h2>Ghirardelli’s Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

<p>Ghirardelli takes gluten-free labeling seriously. Many of their products, including some caramel-based items, are certified gluten-free by third-party organizations. This certification ensures that the product contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

<p>However, not all Ghirardelli caramel products are certified gluten-free. It’s essential to check the packaging for gluten-free labeling or consult the company’s website for the most up-to-date information.</p>

<h2>Potential Risks of Cross-Contamination</h2>

<p>Even if a product’s ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can pose a risk. Ghirardelli states that they follow strict manufacturing practices to minimize cross-contamination. However, they also advise consumers to check the packaging for any allergen warnings, as they cannot guarantee that all products are entirely free from trace amounts of gluten.</p>
