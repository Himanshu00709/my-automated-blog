    <h1>Does Sonic Have Gluten-Free Options? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can be a challenge. Fast food restaurants, in particular, are often associated with limited gluten-free options. Sonic Drive-In, a popular fast-food chain known for its burgers, hot dogs, and milkshakes, has been a topic of interest for those seeking gluten-free meals. In this article, we’ll explore whether Sonic offers gluten-free options, what you can safely eat, and tips for navigating their menu.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. As a result, many individuals must adhere to a strict gluten-free diet, which requires careful attention to food ingredients and preparation methods.</p>

    <p>When dining out, cross-contamination is a significant concern. Even if a dish is inherently gluten-free, it can become contaminated if it comes into contact with gluten-containing foods during preparation. This is especially true in fast-food restaurants, where kitchen spaces are often shared, and staff may not be fully trained in gluten-free protocols.</p>

    <h2>Does Sonic Offer Gluten-Free Options?</h2>

    <p>Sonic Drive-In does not have a dedicated gluten-free menu, but there are some menu items that are naturally gluten-free or can be modified to fit a gluten-free diet. However, it’s important to note that Sonic does not guarantee that any of its menu items are free from cross-contamination. Therefore, individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease should exercise caution when dining at Sonic.</p>
