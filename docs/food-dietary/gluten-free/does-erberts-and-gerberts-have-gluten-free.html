    <li><strong>Ask About Preparation:</strong> Inquire about how the gluten-free bread is stored and prepared. Is it toasted in a separate toaster? Are gloves changed when handling gluten-free items?</li>
    <li><strong>Choose Simple Options:</strong> Opt for menu items that are naturally gluten-free, such as salads (without croutons) or soups that are confirmed to be gluten-free.</li>
</ul>
