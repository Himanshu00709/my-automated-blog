    <h1>Gluten-Free Passover Food: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Passover, or Pesach, is one of the most significant Jewish holidays, commemorating the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. During this time, Jewish families gather to celebrate with traditional meals and rituals. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, Passover can present unique challenges. This guide will explore gluten-free Passover food options, ensuring that everyone can enjoy the holiday without compromising their dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Passover Dietary Restrictions</h2>
    <p>Passover dietary laws are among the most stringent in Jewish tradition. During the eight days of Passover, leavened foods (chametz) are prohibited. This includes any food made from wheat, barley, rye, oats, or spelt that has been allowed to ferment and rise. For those who are gluten-free, this restriction aligns closely with their dietary needs, but it also requires careful planning to ensure that all foods consumed are both kosher for Passover and free from gluten.</p>
