    <h1>Does Piada Have Gluten-Free Pasta? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can often be a challenge. The rise of gluten-free options in restaurants has been a welcome change, but not all establishments cater to this dietary need. Piada Italian Street Food, a popular fast-casual restaurant chain, is known for its fresh and customizable Italian-inspired dishes. But does Piada have gluten-free pasta? In this article, we’ll explore Piada’s menu, gluten-free options, and what you need to know before dining there.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. As a result, many people seek out gluten-free alternatives to traditional wheat-based products, including pasta.</p>

    <p>When dining out, it’s crucial to ensure that the restaurant not only offers gluten-free options but also takes steps to prevent cross-contamination. Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods or surfaces, rendering them unsafe for those with gluten-related disorders.</p>

    <h2>Piada’s Gluten-Free Options</h2>

    <p>Piada Italian Street Food is known for its fresh ingredients and customizable dishes. The restaurant offers a variety of options, including salads, wraps, and pasta bowls. But does Piada have gluten-free pasta? The answer is yes, but with some important considerations.</p>

    <p>Piada offers a gluten-free pasta option made from corn and rice. This pasta is a great alternative for those who need to avoid gluten. However, it’s important to note that while the pasta itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can still occur in the kitchen. Piada’s staff is trained to handle gluten-free orders with care, but the risk of cross-contamination cannot be entirely eliminated.</p>
