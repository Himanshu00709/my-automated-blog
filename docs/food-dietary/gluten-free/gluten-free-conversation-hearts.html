    <h1>Gluten-Free Conversation Hearts: A Sweet and Safe Treat</h1>
    <p>Valentine's Day is synonymous with love, affection, and, of course, sweet treats. Among the most iconic candies of the season are conversation hearts—those tiny, colorful candies with heartfelt messages printed on them. But for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying these candies can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free conversation hearts, a delightful alternative that ensures everyone can partake in the Valentine's Day festivities without worry. In this article, we'll explore the world of gluten-free conversation hearts, their ingredients, benefits, and how they compare to traditional versions.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Conversation Hearts?</h2>

Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Traditional conversation hearts often contain gluten due to the use of certain ingredients or cross-contamination during manufacturing. Gluten-free versions, however, are made with alternative ingredients that are safe for those with gluten-related disorders.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Gluten-Free Conversation Hearts</h2>
    <p>The ingredients in gluten-free conversation hearts are carefully selected to ensure they are free from gluten-containing grains. Common ingredients include:</p>

        <li>Natural and artificial flavors</li>
        <li>Food coloring</li>
        <li>Gluten-free starches (such as tapioca or potato starch)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These ingredients are combined to create the same sweet, crunchy texture and vibrant colors that make conversation hearts so beloved. The key difference is the absence of gluten, making them a safe option for those with dietary restrictions.</p>
