<h1>Are Ghirardelli Squares Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Ghirardelli is a name synonymous with premium chocolate, offering a wide range of products that cater to various tastes and dietary preferences. One of their most popular products is the Ghirardelli Squares, which come in a variety of flavors and are often enjoyed as a treat or used in baking. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Are Ghirardelli Squares gluten-free? In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and other factors to determine whether Ghirardelli Squares are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and manufacturing processes of the foods they consume.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Ghirardelli Squares</h2>

<p>To determine whether Ghirardelli Squares are gluten-free, we first need to examine their ingredients. Ghirardelli offers a variety of Squares, each with its own unique flavor profile. Below is a table summarizing the ingredients of some popular Ghirardelli Squares flavors:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Flavor</th>
        <th>Main Ingredients</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Milk Chocolate</td>
        <td>Sugar, Cocoa Butter, Milk, Chocolate, Soy Lecithin, Vanilla</td>

Ghirardelli has stated that they take precautions to prevent cross-contamination, but they do not guarantee that their products are entirely gluten-free. Therefore, individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease should exercise caution.</p>

It is important to note that this list is subject to change, and consumers should always check the most recent product labels and company statements.
