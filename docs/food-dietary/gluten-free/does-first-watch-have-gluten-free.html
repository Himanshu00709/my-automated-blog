<h1>Does First Watch Have Gluten-Free Options? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>First Watch, a popular breakfast, brunch, and lunch restaurant chain, has gained a reputation for its fresh, healthy, and delicious menu offerings. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can be a challenge. The question on many minds is: <strong>Does First Watch have gluten-free options?</strong> In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free offerings at First Watch, discuss cross-contamination risks, and provide tips for safely enjoying your meal.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to manage their health. Restaurants like First Watch are increasingly catering to this demand by offering gluten-free menu options.</p>

<h2>First Watch’s Commitment to Gluten-Free Dining</h2>

<p>First Watch has made significant strides in accommodating gluten-free diners. The restaurant chain offers a variety of gluten-free options, clearly marked on their menu. However, it’s important to note that while First Watch takes precautions to avoid cross-contamination, their kitchens are not entirely gluten-free environments. This means that there is always a risk of trace amounts of gluten being present in your meal.</p>

<h3>Gluten-Free Menu Options at First Watch</h3>

<p>First Watch’s gluten-free menu includes a variety of breakfast and lunch options. Here are some popular choices:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Category</th>
            <th>Gluten-Free Options</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Breakfast</td>
            <td>Eggs, omelets, fresh fruit, avocado toast (with gluten-free bread), and gluten-free pancakes.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Lunch</td>
            <td>Salads (without croutons), grilled chicken, and gluten-free wraps.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sides</td>
            <td>Fresh fruit, yogurt, and gluten-free toast.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>It’s worth noting that the availability of gluten-free options may vary by location, so it’s always a good idea to check with your local First Watch restaurant before visiting.</p>

<h2>Cross-Contamination Risks at First Watch</h2>

<p>While First Watch offers gluten-free options, it’s important to be aware of the potential for cross-contamination. Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods or surfaces. This can happen during food preparation, cooking, or even serving. First Watch does not have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen, so there is always a risk of trace amounts of gluten being present in your meal.</p>

<p>If you have celiac disease or a severe gluten allergy, it’s crucial to communicate your dietary needs to the staff. They can take extra precautions to minimize the risk of cross-contamination, such as using separate utensils and cooking surfaces.</p>

<h2>Tips for Dining Gluten-Free at First Watch</h2>

<p>Here are some tips to help you safely enjoy a gluten-free meal at First Watch:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Communicate Your Needs:</strong> Inform your server about your gluten intolerance or celiac disease. They can guide you to the safest menu options and alert the kitchen staff to take extra precautions.</li>
    <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> Don’t hesitate to ask about ingredients and preparation methods. Some dishes may contain hidden sources of gluten, such as sauces or marinades.</li>
    <li><strong>Choose Simple Dishes:</strong> Opt for dishes with fewer ingredients, as they are less likely to contain gluten. For example, a simple omelet with fresh vegetables is a safe choice.</li>
    <li><strong>Be Cautious with Shared Equipment:</strong> Be aware that gluten-free items may be prepared on the same equipment as gluten-containing items. If you’re highly sensitive, ask if the kitchen can use separate utensils and cooking surfaces.</li>
</ul>
