<h1>Does Sonic Have Anything Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, dining out can be a challenge. Fast food restaurants, in particular, are often associated with gluten-heavy menus. However, many chains are now offering gluten-free options to cater to the growing demand for allergen-friendly meals. Sonic Drive-In, known for its extensive menu of burgers, hot dogs, and milkshakes, is no exception. But does Sonic have anything gluten-free? Let’s dive into the details.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to fatigue and skin problems. As a result, many individuals must adhere to a strict gluten-free diet. When dining out, it’s crucial to identify safe options to avoid cross-contamination and ensure a gluten-free meal.</p>

<h2>Sonic’s Gluten-Free Options</h2>

<p>Sonic Drive-In offers a variety of menu items that are naturally gluten-free or can be modified to fit a gluten-free diet. However, it’s important to note that Sonic does not have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen, so cross-contamination is a possibility. Here’s a breakdown of some gluten-free options at Sonic:</p>

<h3>1. Burgers and Sandwiches</h3>

<p>While Sonic’s buns contain gluten, you can order any burger or sandwich without the bun. Opt for a lettuce wrap or enjoy the patty and toppings on their own. Be sure to specify that you need a gluten-free meal to avoid cross-contamination.</p>

<h3>2. Hot Dogs</h3>

<p>Similar to burgers, Sonic’s hot dogs are served on gluten-containing buns. However, you can request a hot dog without the bun and enjoy it with gluten-free toppings like mustard, ketchup, and relish.</p>

<h3>3. Sides</h3>

<p>Sonic offers several gluten-free side options, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>French Fries (cooked in a shared fryer, so cross-contamination is possible)</li>
    <li>Tater Tots (also cooked in a shared fryer)</li>
    <li>Apple Slices</li>
    <li>Mozzarella Sticks (check for gluten-free breading options)</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Desserts</h3>

<p>Sonic’s desserts are a mixed bag when it comes to gluten-free options. While their ice cream and milkshakes are generally gluten-free, be cautious with mix-ins and toppings that may contain gluten. Always ask for ingredient details before ordering.</p>

<h3>5. Beverages</h3>

<p>Most of Sonic’s beverages, including soft drinks, iced tea, and lemonade, are gluten-free. However, be cautious with specialty drinks that may contain gluten-containing ingredients.</p>
