    <h1>Does Five Guys Have a Gluten-Free Bun? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Five Guys is a popular fast-food chain known for its customizable burgers, fries, and hot dogs. With the increasing demand for gluten-free options, many people wonder if Five Guys offers a gluten-free bun. This article will explore whether Five Guys has a gluten-free bun, the options available for those with gluten sensitivities, and how to navigate the menu safely.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term complications. As a result, many people seek gluten-free alternatives when dining out.</p>

    <p>Five Guys has recognized the growing need for gluten-free options and has made efforts to accommodate customers with dietary restrictions. However, it's essential to understand the limitations and potential risks associated with cross-contamination in a fast-food environment.</p>

    <h2>Does Five Guys Offer a Gluten-Free Bun?</h2>

    <p>As of the latest information available, Five Guys does not offer a gluten-free bun. The standard buns used for their burgers and hot dogs contain gluten. However, Five Guys does provide an alternative for those who need to avoid gluten: the option to order your burger or hot dog "protein style," which means it will be served in a lettuce wrap instead of a bun.</p>

    <p>While this is not a traditional gluten-free bun, it is a viable option for those who need to avoid gluten. The lettuce wrap is naturally gluten-free and can be a refreshing and healthy alternative to a traditional bun.</p>

    <h2>Navigating the Five Guys Menu for Gluten-Free Options</h2>
