    <p>As you can see, the ingredients list does not include any gluten-containing components. However, it's important to note that cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process, which we will discuss in the next section.</p>

    <h2>Are Swedish Fish Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Based on the ingredients list, Swedish Fish do not contain any gluten. The primary ingredients, such as sugar, corn syrup, and modified corn starch, are naturally gluten-free. Additionally, Swedish Fish are manufactured by Mondelez International, which has confirmed that Swedish Fish are gluten-free and safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <p>However, it's crucial to consider the possibility of cross-contamination. Cross-contamination can occur if the candy is produced in a facility that also processes gluten-containing products. To ensure that Swedish Fish are safe for consumption, Mondelez International has implemented strict manufacturing practices to prevent cross-contamination. They also regularly test their products to ensure they meet gluten-free standards.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

    <p>While Swedish Fish are considered gluten-free based on their ingredients and manufacturing processes, they do not carry an official gluten-free certification. This means that they have not been certified by a third-party organization, such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). However, the absence of certification does not necessarily mean that the product contains gluten. Many companies choose not to pursue certification due to the associated costs and time, even if their products are gluten-free.</p>

    <p>If you have severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, it's always a good idea to check the packaging for any allergen warnings or contact the manufacturer directly for the most up-to-date information.</p>
