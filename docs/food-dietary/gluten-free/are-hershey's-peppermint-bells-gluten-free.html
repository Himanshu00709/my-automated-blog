    <p>As you can see, the primary ingredients in Hershey's Peppermint Bells are naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that the absence of gluten-containing ingredients does not always guarantee that a product is entirely gluten-free. Cross-contamination during manufacturing can also be a concern.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination</h2>

    <p>Even if a product’s ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. This happens when gluten-free products come into contact with gluten-containing products or surfaces. Hershey’s, like many large food manufacturers, has protocols in place to minimize this risk, but it’s always a good idea to check for any warnings on the packaging.</p>

    <p>Hershey’s does not specifically label their Peppermint Bells as gluten-free, which means they do not guarantee that the product is free from cross-contamination. For individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, this could be a cause for concern.</p>

    <h2>Certifications and Labels</h2>

    <p>When it comes to gluten-free products, certifications from recognized organizations can provide an extra layer of assurance. Unfortunately, Hershey's Peppermint Bells do not carry any gluten-free certifications. This lack of certification, combined with the absence of a gluten-free label, suggests that the product may not be entirely safe for those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance.</p>
