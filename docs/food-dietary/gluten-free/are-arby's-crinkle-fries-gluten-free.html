    <h1>Are Arby's Crinkle Fries Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can be a challenge. One of the most common questions is whether popular fast-food items, like Arby's Crinkle Fries, are gluten-free. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, preparation methods, and potential cross-contamination risks associated with Arby's Crinkle Fries to help you make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it’s crucial to know whether the foods you consume are truly gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Arby's Crinkle Fries</h2>

    <p>Arby's Crinkle Fries are made from potatoes, which are naturally gluten-free. However, the preparation process and additional ingredients can introduce gluten. Here’s a breakdown of the ingredients:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Potatoes</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vegetable Oil</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Dextrose</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Based on the ingredients list, Arby's Crinkle Fries do not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, the story doesn’t end here. Cross-contamination is a significant concern for those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the preparation and cooking process. At Arby's, fries are typically cooked in the same oil as other menu items that may contain gluten, such as chicken tenders or mozzarella sticks. This shared fryer can lead to gluten particles contaminating the fries.</p>

    <p>Arby's does not claim that their fries are gluten-free, and they advise customers with gluten sensitivities to exercise caution. If you have celiac disease or a severe gluten allergy, it’s best to avoid Arby's Crinkle Fries or inquire about dedicated fryers at your local Arby's location.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Options at Arby's</h2>

    <p>While Arby's Crinkle Fries may not be a safe option for those with gluten sensitivities, Arby's does offer other menu items that are more suitable. Here’s a list of gluten-free options at Arby's:</p>

            </tr>
        </thead>

                <td>Roast Beef Sandwich (without bun)</td>
