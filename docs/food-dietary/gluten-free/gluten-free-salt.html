    <h1>Gluten-Free Salt: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. While many people focus on gluten-free grains, flours, and processed foods, one often overlooked product is salt. Yes, salt! But is salt gluten-free? And why does it matter? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the world of gluten-free salt, exploring its importance, types, and how to ensure you’re choosing the right product for your dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Salt?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free salt is simply salt that does not contain any gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. While pure salt is naturally gluten-free, some salts may be processed or packaged in facilities that handle gluten-containing products, leading to potential cross-contamination. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, even trace amounts of gluten can cause adverse health effects, making it crucial to choose certified gluten-free salt.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Salt Matters</h2>

    <p>For most people, salt is a staple in their diet, used to enhance the flavor of food. However, for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. While salt itself doesn’t contain gluten, the risk of cross-contamination during processing or packaging makes it essential to opt for gluten-free certified products. This ensures that the salt is safe for consumption by individuals who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Types of Gluten-Free Salt</h2>

    <p>There are several types of salt available on the market, and most are naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to be aware of the different varieties and their potential sources of contamination. Below is a table summarizing the most common types of gluten-free salt:</p>

    <h2>How to Ensure Your Salt is Gluten-Free</h2>

    <p>When selecting salt, especially if you have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it’s important to take a few extra steps to ensure it’s gluten-free:</p>
