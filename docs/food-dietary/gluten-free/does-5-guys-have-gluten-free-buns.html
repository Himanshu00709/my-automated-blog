<h1>Does Five Guys Have Gluten-Free Buns? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Five Guys is a popular fast-food chain known for its delicious burgers, fries, and customizable menu options. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can be a challenge. One of the most common questions asked by gluten-free diners is whether Five Guys offers gluten-free buns. In this article, we’ll explore the options available at Five Guys for those following a gluten-free diet, including the availability of gluten-free buns, cross-contamination risks, and alternative menu choices.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to manage their health. When dining out, it’s crucial to know which restaurants offer gluten-free options and how they handle food preparation to avoid cross-contamination.</p>

<h2>Does Five Guys Offer Gluten-Free Buns?</h2>

<p>As of the latest information available, Five Guys does not offer gluten-free buns. The chain is known for its fresh, made-to-order burgers, but their buns are made from wheat flour, which contains gluten. This means that if you’re strictly avoiding gluten, you’ll need to consider alternative options when ordering at Five Guys.</p>

<h3>Alternative Options for Gluten-Free Diners</h3>

<p>While Five Guys doesn’t provide gluten-free buns, there are still ways to enjoy a meal at the restaurant without consuming gluten. Here are some options:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Lettuce Wrap:</strong> Many gluten-free diners opt for a lettuce wrap instead of a bun. Five Guys is happy to accommodate this request, allowing you to enjoy your burger without the gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Burger Bowl:</strong> Another popular option is to order your burger as a bowl. This means your patty and toppings will be served in a container without a bun, making it a safe choice for those avoiding gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Hot Dogs:</strong> Five Guys also offers hot dogs, which can be ordered without a bun. Be sure to check with the staff about the ingredients in the hot dogs to ensure they are gluten-free.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cross-Contamination Risks at Five Guys</h2>

<p>One of the biggest concerns for individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity is cross-contamination. Even if a restaurant offers gluten-free options, there’s always a risk that gluten-containing ingredients could come into contact with gluten-free foods during preparation.</p>

<p>At Five Guys, the risk of cross-contamination is relatively high. The restaurant uses shared cooking surfaces and utensils, and the same gloves are often used to handle both gluten-containing and gluten-free items. Additionally, the fryers used for French fries are also used for other items that may contain gluten, such as breaded items. Therefore, if you have celiac disease or a severe gluten allergy, it’s important to communicate your dietary needs clearly to the staff and consider the potential risks.</p>

<h2>Five Guys Gluten-Free Menu Options</h2>
