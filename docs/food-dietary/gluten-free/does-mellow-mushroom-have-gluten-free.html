    <h1>Does Mellow Mushroom Have Gluten-Free Options?</h1>

    <p>Mellow Mushroom is a popular pizza chain known for its eclectic atmosphere and creative pizza offerings. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can be a challenge. The question on many minds is: <strong>Does Mellow Mushroom have gluten-free options?</strong> In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free offerings at Mellow Mushroom, how they cater to gluten-sensitive customers, and what you need to know before ordering.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to manage their health. Restaurants like Mellow Mushroom have recognized this growing demand and have started offering gluten-free options to accommodate their customers.</p>

    <h2>Mellow Mushroom’s Gluten-Free Menu</h2>

    <p>Mellow Mushroom has made significant strides in offering gluten-free options for its customers. The restaurant provides a dedicated gluten-free crust, which is made from a blend of rice flour, potato starch, and tapioca flour. This crust is designed to mimic the texture and taste of traditional pizza crust while being safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <p>Here’s a breakdown of Mellow Mushroom’s gluten-free offerings:</p>
