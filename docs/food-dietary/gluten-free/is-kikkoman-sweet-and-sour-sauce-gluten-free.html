The inclusion of soy sauce, which contains wheat, makes this product unsuitable for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. While some ingredients like sugar, tomato paste, and pineapple juice concentrate are naturally gluten-free, the presence of soy sauce is a deal-breaker for those avoiding gluten.</p>
