    <h1>Is Old El Paso Fajita Seasoning Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>When it comes to preparing delicious fajitas at home, Old El Paso is a brand that many people trust. Their fajita seasoning mix is a popular choice for adding flavor to chicken, beef, or vegetable fajitas. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Old El Paso Fajita Seasoning is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to determine if this seasoning is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it’s essential for these individuals to carefully scrutinize food labels and understand the potential sources of gluten in their diet.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Old El Paso Fajita Seasoning</h2>

    <p>To determine if Old El Paso Fajita Seasoning is gluten-free, we need to examine its ingredients. According to the product label, the seasoning typically contains the following:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Potential Gluten Source</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Spices (including chili pepper, cumin, and paprika)</td>
                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Onion Powder</td>
                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Garlic Powder</td>
                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Corn Starch</td>
                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Maltodextrin (from corn)</td>
                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Natural Flavors</td>
                <td>Possibly (requires verification)</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As seen in the table above, most of the ingredients in Old El Paso Fajita Seasoning are naturally gluten-free. However, the inclusion of "natural flavors" can sometimes be a concern, as these may contain gluten depending on their source. It’s important to verify the source of these flavors to ensure they are gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can pose a risk. This occurs when gluten-free products come into contact with gluten-containing products or surfaces during production. Old El Paso, like many food manufacturers, follows strict protocols to minimize cross-contamination. However, it’s always a good idea to check the packaging for any gluten-free certifications or statements.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certifications and Labeling</h2>

    <p>Old El Paso products, including their fajita seasoning, are often labeled as gluten-free. This labeling is based on the ingredients used and the manufacturing processes in place. However, it’s important to note that Old El Paso does not have a dedicated gluten-free facility, which means there is always a slight risk of cross-contamination. For those with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, this may be a consideration.</p>
