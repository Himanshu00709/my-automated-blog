    <h1>Are Hershey's Cookies and Cream Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Hershey's Cookies and Cream is a beloved chocolate bar that combines creamy white chocolate with crunchy cookie bits. Its unique texture and flavor have made it a favorite among chocolate enthusiasts. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether this treat is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential cross-contamination risks to determine whether Hershey's Cookies and Cream is safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and manufacturing processes of the foods they consume.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Hershey's Cookies and Cream</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Hershey's Cookies and Cream is gluten-free, we must first examine its ingredients. The primary components of this chocolate bar include:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Source</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Sugar</td>
                <td>Derived from sugar cane or sugar beets</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vegetable Oil (Palm, Shea, Sunflower, Safflower, and/or Palm Kernel Oil)</td>
                <td>Plant-based oils</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Nonfat Milk</td>
                <td>Dairy</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Chocolate</td>
                <td>Processed from cocoa beans</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cookies (Wheat Flour, Sugar, Palm Oil, Cocoa, Salt, Baking Soda, Soy Lecithin)</td>
                <td>Contains wheat flour</td>
                <td>Contains Gluten</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As evident from the table, the cookie pieces in Hershey's Cookies and Cream contain wheat flour, which is a source of gluten. This immediately raises a red flag for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if a product does not contain gluten-containing ingredients, cross-contamination during manufacturing can pose a risk. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free products come into contact with gluten-containing products or surfaces during production, packaging, or transportation.</p>

    <p>Hershey's has stated that they do not label their products as gluten-free unless they are specifically formulated to be so. This means that even if a product does not contain gluten ingredients, it may still be at risk of cross-contamination. Hershey's Cookies and Cream, which contains gluten in its cookie pieces, is not considered gluten-free by the company.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Hershey's Cookies and Cream</h2>

    <p>For those who love the taste of cookies and cream but need to avoid gluten, there are several gluten-free alternatives available on the market. Some popular options include:</p>

    </ul>
