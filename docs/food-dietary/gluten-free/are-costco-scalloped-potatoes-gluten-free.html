<h1>Are Costco Scalloped Potatoes Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>Scalloped potatoes are a beloved comfort food, often enjoyed during family gatherings, holidays, or as a hearty side dish. For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding gluten-free options is crucial. Costco, a popular wholesale retailer, offers a variety of prepared foods, including scalloped potatoes.
