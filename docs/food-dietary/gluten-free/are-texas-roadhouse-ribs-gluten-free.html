<h1>Are Texas Roadhouse Ribs Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>Texas Roadhouse is a popular restaurant chain known for its mouthwatering ribs, steaks, and hearty American cuisine. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can be a challenge. One of the most frequently asked questions is: <strong>Are Texas Roadhouse ribs gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, preparation methods, and menu options to help you make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to severe digestive issues, inflammation, and other health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial to know whether the food you’re eating contains gluten or has been cross-contaminated during preparation.</p>

<h2>Are Texas Roadhouse Ribs Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Texas Roadhouse offers a variety of ribs, including their famous Fall-Off-The-Bone Ribs. According to the restaurant’s allergen menu, the ribs themselves do not contain gluten ingredients. However, the preparation process and the sauces used can introduce gluten into the dish. Here’s a breakdown:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Menu Item</th>
            <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Fall-Off-The-Bone Ribs</td>
            <td>Gluten-Free (without sauce)</td>
            <td>The ribs are seasoned with a dry rub that does not contain gluten. However, the BBQ sauce contains gluten.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>BBQ Sauce</td>
            <td>Contains Gluten</td>
            <td>The BBQ sauce includes soy sauce, which contains wheat.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Seasoned Fries</td>
            <td>Contains Gluten</td>
            <td>The fries are coated with a seasoning that contains gluten.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Gluten-Free Options at Texas Roadhouse</h2>
