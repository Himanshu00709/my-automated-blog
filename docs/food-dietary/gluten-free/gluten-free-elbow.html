<p>Cooking gluten-free elbow pasta is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>

    <li><strong>Cook Time:</strong> Gluten-free pasta often cooks faster than traditional pasta, so keep an eye on it. Check the package instructions for the recommended cooking time, usually around 8-10 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Test for Doneness:</strong> Taste the pasta to ensure it's cooked to your desired level of tenderness. Be careful not to overcook, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy.</li>
    <li><strong>Drain and Serve:</strong> Once cooked, drain the pasta and rinse it briefly with cold water to stop the cooking process. Serve immediately with your favorite sauce or toppings.</li>
