    <h1>Does Freddy's Have Gluten-Free Options? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers is a popular fast-food chain known for its delicious steakburgers, hot dogs, and frozen custard. But for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can be a challenge. The question on many minds is: <strong>Does Freddy's have gluten-free options?</strong> In this article, we'll explore Freddy's menu, discuss gluten-free choices, and provide tips for safely navigating the menu if you're avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. As a result, many individuals must adhere to a strict gluten-free diet. When dining out, it's essential to identify restaurants that offer safe and reliable gluten-free options.</p>

    <h2>Freddy's Menu: A Closer Look</h2>

    <p>Freddy's menu is centered around steakburgers, hot dogs, and frozen custard. While these items are traditionally made with gluten-containing ingredients, Freddy's has made efforts to accommodate customers with dietary restrictions. Below, we'll break down the menu and highlight potential gluten-free options.</p>

    <h3>Steakburgers</h3>

    <p>Freddy's steakburgers are made with 100% ground beef and cooked to order. However, the buns used for the burgers contain gluten. If you're avoiding gluten, you can request a lettuce wrap or enjoy your burger without the bun. Be sure to inform the staff of your dietary needs to avoid cross-contamination.</p>

    <h3>Hot Dogs</h3>

    <p>Freddy's hot dogs are another popular menu item. Like the steakburgers, the buns used for hot dogs contain gluten. However, you can opt for a lettuce wrap or enjoy the hot dog without the bun. Additionally, Freddy's offers a variety of toppings, such as cheese, onions, and relish, which are generally gluten-free. Always double-check with the staff to ensure the toppings are safe.</p>

    <h3>Frozen Custard</h3>

    <p>Freddy's is famous for its frozen custard, which is a gluten-free treat. The custard is made with simple ingredients like milk, cream, sugar, and eggs, and does not contain gluten. However, be cautious with mix-ins and toppings, as some may contain gluten. Stick to gluten-free options like fresh fruit or chocolate syrup.</p>

    <h3>Side Dishes</h3>

    <p>Freddy's offers a variety of side dishes, including fries, onion rings, and cheese curds. The fries are typically gluten-free, as they are made from potatoes and cooked in a dedicated fryer. However, onion rings and cheese curds are breaded and contain gluten. Always confirm with the staff to ensure the fries are cooked in a gluten-free environment.</p>
