    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks at Raising Cane's</h2>

    <p>While some items at Raising Cane's are gluten-free, cross-contamination is a significant concern. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods or surfaces. At Raising Cane's, the chicken fingers are breaded with wheat flour, and the same fryers are used for both chicken and fries. This means that even though the fries are gluten-free by ingredient, they may still contain traces of gluten due to shared cooking equipment.</p>

    <p>If you have celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, it’s crucial to communicate your dietary needs to the staff. While Raising Cane's does not guarantee a gluten-free environment, some locations may accommodate requests to minimize cross-contamination. However, the risk cannot be entirely eliminated.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Dining Gluten-Free at Raising Cane's</h2>

    <p>If you’re determined to enjoy a meal at Raising Cane's while adhering to a gluten-free diet, here are some tips to help you navigate the menu safely:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stick to Gluten-Free Items:</strong> Focus on the crinkle-cut fries, coleslaw, and Cane's sauce. Avoid the chicken fingers and Texas toast.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask About Fryer Usage:</strong> Inquire if the fries are cooked in a dedicated fryer. Some locations may have separate fryers for fries and chicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Communicate Your Needs:</strong> Inform the staff about your gluten intolerance or celiac disease. They may be able to take extra precautions in the kitchen.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Updates:</strong> Menu items and preparation methods can change. Always verify the gluten-free status of items before ordering.</li>
    </ul>
