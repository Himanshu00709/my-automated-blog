    <h1>Are Andes Candies Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Andes Candies, with their iconic green packaging and rich, minty chocolate layers, have been a beloved treat for decades. Whether you're enjoying them as a dessert topping, a baking ingredient, or simply as a sweet snack, these candies are a favorite for many. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Andes Candies are gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we'll delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential risks associated with Andes Candies to determine if they are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Implications</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions. Therefore, it's crucial for those on a gluten-free diet to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and manufacturing processes of the foods they consume.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Andes Candies</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Andes Candies are gluten-free, we first need to examine their ingredients. The primary ingredients in Andes Candies include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Palm Kernel and Palm Oil</li>
        <li>Nonfat Milk</li>
        <li>Lactose</li>
        <li>Milk Protein Concentrate</li>
        <li>Soy Lecithin</li>
        <li>Peppermint Oil</li>
        <li>Artificial Flavor</li>
        <li>Artificial Color (Yellow 5 Lake, Blue 1 Lake)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it's important to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process, which we'll explore in the next section.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if a product's ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing if the product is produced in a facility that also processes gluten-containing foods. This is a critical consideration for individuals with celiac disease, as even trace amounts of gluten can trigger symptoms.</p>

    <p>According to the manufacturer, Tootsie Roll Industries, Andes Candies are produced in facilities that also process wheat. While the company states that they follow strict cleaning protocols to prevent cross-contamination, they do not guarantee that their products are entirely free from gluten. This means that there is a potential risk of cross-contamination, albeit minimal.</p>

    <h2>Are Andes Candies Certified Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Certification by a recognized gluten-free organization can provide additional assurance for consumers. However, Andes Candies are not certified gluten-free by any major gluten-free certification body, such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). This lack of certification further underscores the potential risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Andes Candies</h2>

    <p>For those who prefer to err on the side of caution, there are several gluten-free alternatives to Andes Candies available on the market. These alternatives are produced in dedicated gluten-free facilities and are certified gluten-free, providing peace of mind for those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity.</p>
