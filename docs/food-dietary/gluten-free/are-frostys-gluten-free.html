    <h1>Are Frostys Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of fast food can be a daunting task. One of the most common questions that arise is whether popular treats like Wendy's Frostys are gluten-free. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, preparation methods, and potential cross-contamination risks associated with Frostys to provide a clear answer to this question.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Implications</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it's crucial for these individuals to be vigilant about the foods they consume, especially when dining out.</p>

    <h2>What Are Frostys Made Of?</h2>

    <p>Wendy's Frostys are a beloved treat, known for their creamy texture and rich flavor. But what exactly goes into making a Frosty? The primary ingredients include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Cream</li>
        <li>Corn Syrup</li>
        <li>Whey</li>
        <li>Cocoa (for chocolate Frostys)</li>
        <li>Natural and Artificial Flavors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, these ingredients do not contain gluten. However, it's essential to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process.</p>

    <h2>Are Frostys Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>According to Wendy's official allergen information, Frostys are considered gluten-free. The ingredients used in Frostys do not contain gluten, and Wendy's has stated that they take precautions to avoid cross-contamination. However, it's important to note that Wendy's kitchens are not entirely gluten-free environments. Therefore, there is always a slight risk of cross-contamination, especially if the same equipment is used for gluten-containing products.</p>

    <h2>Potential Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>While Frostys themselves do not contain gluten, the risk of cross-contamination cannot be entirely ruled out. Here are some factors to consider:</p>

                <th>Explanation</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Shared Equipment</td>
                <td>Low to Moderate</td>
                <td>If the same equipment is used for gluten-containing products, there is a risk of cross-contamination.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Preparation Area</td>
                <td>Low</td>
                <td>Frostys are typically prepared in a separate area, reducing the risk of cross-contamination.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Employee Handling</td>
                <td>Low</td>
                <td>Employees are trained to handle food safely, but human error can never be completely eliminated.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
