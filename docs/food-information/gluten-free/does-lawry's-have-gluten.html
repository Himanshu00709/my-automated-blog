<h2>How to Identify Gluten in Lawry's Products</h2>

<p>When determining whether a Lawry's product contains gluten, it’s important to read the ingredient list carefully. Look for ingredients such as wheat, barley, rye, and malt, which are common sources of gluten. Additionally, some products may have a "gluten-free" label, which can make identification easier. However, not all gluten-free products are labeled as such, so always double-check the ingredients.</p>

<h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

<p>Even if a product does not contain gluten ingredients, cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing. This is especially important for individuals with celiac disease, as even trace amounts of gluten can cause a reaction. Lawry's does not explicitly state that their facilities are gluten-free, so there is a potential risk of cross-contamination. If you are highly sensitive to gluten, it’s best to contact the manufacturer directly for more information.</p>
