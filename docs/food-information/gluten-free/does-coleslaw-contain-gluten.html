    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Coleslaw</h2>

    <p>While the primary ingredients in coleslaw are naturally gluten-free, there are several potential sources of gluten that you should be aware of:</p>

    <h3>1. Mayonnaise</h3>

    <p>Mayonnaise is a common ingredient in coleslaw dressing. While most mayonnaise brands are gluten-free, some may contain additives or thickeners that include gluten. It's essential to read the label carefully or opt for brands that explicitly state they are gluten-free.</p>

    <h3>2. Vinegar</h3>

    <p>Vinegar is another key component of coleslaw dressing. Most vinegar, including apple cider vinegar and white vinegar, is gluten-free. However, malt vinegar, which is derived from barley, contains gluten. Always check the type of vinegar used in the dressing to ensure it's safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h3>3. Pre-packaged Coleslaw Mix</h3>

    <p>Some pre-packaged coleslaw mixes may contain additives or preservatives that include gluten. Additionally, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. If you're using a pre-packaged mix, look for one that is certified gluten-free.</p>

    <h3>4. Additional Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Some coleslaw recipes include additional ingredients like croutons, breadcrumbs, or certain spices that may contain gluten. Always review the recipe and ingredient list carefully to ensure all components are gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>How to Ensure Your Coleslaw is Gluten-Free</h2>

    <p>If you're preparing coleslaw at home and need it to be gluten-free, follow these steps to ensure safety:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Start with fresh, whole ingredients like cabbage, carrots, and gluten-free mayonnaise. Avoid pre-packaged mixes unless they are certified gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Labels:</strong> Carefully read the labels of all packaged ingredients, including mayonnaise, vinegar, and spices, to ensure they are gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Cross-Contamination:</strong> Use clean utensils and preparation surfaces to avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing foods.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Your Own Dressing:</strong> Consider making your own coleslaw dressing using gluten-free ingredients. This way, you have complete control over what goes into your dish.</li>
    </ol>
