<h1>Does Ragu Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Ragu is a popular brand of pasta sauces that has been a staple in many households for decades. Whether you're making spaghetti, lasagna, or any other pasta dish, Ragu sauces are often a go-to choice. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether Ragu contains gluten is of utmost importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of Ragu sauces, explore their gluten content, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it's crucial for individuals with these conditions to carefully scrutinize the ingredients of any food product they consume.</p>

<h2>Does Ragu Contain Gluten?</h2>

<p>The answer to whether Ragu contains gluten is not straightforward. Ragu offers a variety of sauces, and the gluten content can vary depending on the specific product. Generally, Ragu sauces are made from tomatoes, herbs, and spices, which are naturally gluten-free. However, some Ragu products may contain ingredients that introduce gluten into the sauce.</p>

<h3>Common Ingredients in Ragu Sauces</h3>

<p>While these ingredients are generally gluten-free, some Ragu sauces may include additives or thickeners that contain gluten.
