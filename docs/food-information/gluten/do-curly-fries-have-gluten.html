    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Curly Fries</h2>

    <p>While potatoes and oil are naturally gluten-free, the seasonings and coatings used in curly fries can be a source of gluten. Here are some potential sources of gluten in curly fries:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wheat Flour:</strong> Many curly fries are coated with wheat flour to achieve a crispy texture. Wheat flour contains gluten, making these fries unsuitable for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> Some seasonings may contain gluten as a filler or anti-caking agent. It's important to check the ingredient list or contact the manufacturer to confirm whether the seasonings are gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> Even if the ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process or in the kitchen where the fries are prepared. This is especially common in restaurants that use shared fryers for gluten-containing foods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Determine if Curly Fries Are Gluten-Free</h2>

    <p>If you're unsure whether the curly fries you're considering are gluten-free, here are some steps you can take to determine their gluten content:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Check the Ingredient List:</strong> Look for any ingredients that contain gluten, such as wheat flour or barley malt. If the ingredient list is not available, contact the manufacturer for more information.</li>
        <li><strong>Look for Gluten-Free Labels:</strong> Some brands and restaurants offer gluten-free curly fries that are clearly labeled as such. These products are typically made with gluten-free coatings and seasonings.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask About Cross-Contamination:</strong> If you're dining out, ask the restaurant staff about their preparation methods and whether they use shared fryers. Some restaurants may have dedicated fryers for gluten-free items.</li>
    </ol>
