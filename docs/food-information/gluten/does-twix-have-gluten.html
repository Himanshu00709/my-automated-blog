    <h1>Does Twix Have Gluten? A Detailed Guide</h1>
    <p>Twix is one of the most popular candy bars in the world, known for its unique combination of crunchy cookie, creamy caramel, and smooth chocolate. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Twix contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we will explore the ingredients of Twix, discuss its gluten content, and provide guidance for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues. Symptoms can range from digestive problems to skin rashes, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it's essential for individuals with these conditions to carefully scrutinize the ingredients of the foods they consume.</p>

    <h2>Twix Ingredients: A Closer Look</h2>
    <p>To determine whether Twix contains gluten, we need to examine its ingredients. The standard Twix bar consists of the following components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, chocolate, skim milk, lactose, milkfat, soy lecithin, artificial flavor)</li>
        <li>Caramel (corn syrup, sugar, skim milk, palm oil, lactose, salt, soy lecithin, artificial flavor)</li>
        <li>Enriched wheat flour (wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The key ingredient to focus on here is <strong>enriched wheat flour</strong>, which is a primary source of gluten. Wheat flour is used in the cookie base of the Twix bar, making it a gluten-containing product.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Twix</h2>
    <p>For those who need to avoid gluten, there are several gluten-free alternatives to Twix available in the market. These products are made with gluten-free flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or coconut flour. Some popular gluten-free candy bars include:</p>
