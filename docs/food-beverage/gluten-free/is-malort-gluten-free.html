    <h1>Is Malort Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Malört, a traditional Swedish spirit known for its intensely bitter flavor, has gained a cult following in the United States, particularly in Chicago. As more people become conscious of their dietary restrictions, especially those related to gluten, a common question arises: Is Malört gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients, production process, and gluten content of Malört to provide a definitive answer.</p>

    <h2>What is Malört?</h2>

    <p>Malört, also spelled "Malmört," is a type of bitter liqueur that originated in Sweden. It is made from wormwood, a herb known for its strong, bitter taste. The spirit was brought to the United States by Swedish immigrants and has since become a staple in Chicago’s drinking culture. Malört is often consumed as a shot, and its unique flavor profile has earned it a reputation as an acquired taste.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients of Malört</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Malört is gluten-free, it’s essential to examine its ingredients. The primary components of Malört include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wormwood:</strong> The key ingredient that gives Malört its signature bitterness.</li>
        <li><strong>Grain Alcohol:</strong> The base spirit used in the production of Malört.</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> Used to dilute the alcohol to the desired proof.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Botanicals:</strong> Various herbs and spices may be added to enhance the flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The critical factor in determining gluten content is the type of grain used in the production of the base alcohol. If the grain alcohol is derived from gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, or rye, the final product may contain gluten.</p>

    <h2>Is Malört Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The answer to whether Malört is gluten-free lies in its production process. Malört is distilled, and distillation is a process that typically removes gluten proteins from the final product. According to the FDA, distilled spirits made from gluten-containing grains are considered gluten-free because the distillation process eliminates gluten proteins. However, some individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity may still experience reactions to distilled spirits made from gluten-containing grains.</p>

    <p>In the case of Malört, the base alcohol is typically made from grains that may contain gluten. However, the distillation process should, in theory, remove any gluten proteins, making Malört safe for most people with gluten intolerance. That said, it’s always best to consult with a healthcare professional if you have severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Gluten Content in Popular Spirits</h2>

    <p>To provide a broader perspective, let’s compare the gluten content of Malört with other popular spirits:</p>
