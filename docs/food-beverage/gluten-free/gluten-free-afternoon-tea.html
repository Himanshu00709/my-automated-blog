    <p>Afternoon tea is a timeless tradition that has been enjoyed for centuries. It’s a moment to pause, relax, and indulge in a selection of delicate sandwiches, scones, and pastries.

    <h2>The Rise of Gluten-Free Afternoon Tea</h2>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has grown significantly. This is due in part to the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten intolerance, as well as the growing popularity of gluten-free diets for health and wellness reasons. As a result, many tea rooms, hotels, and restaurants now offer gluten-free afternoon tea options. These establishments have gone to great lengths to ensure that their gluten-free offerings are just as delicious and visually appealing as their traditional counterparts.</p>
