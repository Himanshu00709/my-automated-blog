    <h1>Gluten-Free Pops: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding safe and delicious snacks can be a challenge. Pops, whether they are ice pops, lollipops, or popcorn, are popular treats that many people enjoy. However, not all pops are created equal when it comes to gluten content. In this article, we will explore what makes a pop gluten-free, which brands and types are safe to consume, and how to ensure that your favorite pops are free from gluten contamination.</p>

    <h2>What Does Gluten-Free Mean?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. A product is considered gluten-free if it contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, as per the FDA guidelines. This threshold is generally safe for most people with gluten-related disorders.</p>

    <h2>Types of Gluten-Free Pops</h2>

    <p>There are several types of pops that are naturally gluten-free or have gluten-free options available. Below, we will discuss some of the most popular types of pops and their gluten-free status.</p>

    <h3>Ice Pops</h3>

    <p>Ice pops, also known as popsicles, are a refreshing treat, especially during the summer months. Many ice pops are made from fruit juice, water, and sugar, which are naturally gluten-free. However, it's essential to check the ingredient list for any additives or flavorings that may contain gluten. Some brands may use malt flavoring, which is derived from barley and contains gluten.</p>
