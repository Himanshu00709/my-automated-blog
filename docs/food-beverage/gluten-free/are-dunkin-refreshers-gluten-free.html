However, they also emphasize that their stores are not gluten-free environments. This means that while some products may be made with gluten-free ingredients, there is always a risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>For those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance, Dunkin' recommends consulting with their staff and reviewing their allergen information, which is available on their website and in-store. This information can help you make an informed decision about which products are safe for you to consume.</p>
