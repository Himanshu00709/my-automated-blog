    <h1>Is Squirt Soda Gluten-Free? A Detailed Analysis</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of food and beverages can be a daunting task. One common question that arises is whether popular sodas, like Squirt, are gluten-free. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of Squirt soda, explore its gluten-free status, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>What is Squirt Soda?</h2>

    <p>Squirt soda is a citrus-flavored soft drink that has been a favorite among soda enthusiasts since its introduction in 1938. Known for its refreshing grapefruit taste, Squirt is often enjoyed on its own or as a mixer in cocktails. The soda is produced by Keurig Dr Pepper, a leading beverage company in the United States.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Squirt Soda</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Squirt soda is gluten-free, it's essential to examine its ingredients. The primary ingredients in Squirt soda include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Carbonated Water</li>
        <li>High Fructose Corn Syrup</li>
        <li>Citric Acid</li>
        <li>Natural Flavors</li>
        <li>Sodium Benzoate (Preservative)</li>
        <li>Caffeine</li>
        <li>Sodium Citrate</li>
        <li>Gum Arabic</li>
        <li>Ester Gum</li>
        <li>Calcium Disodium EDTA (to protect flavor)</li>
        <li>Yellow 5</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it's important to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process.</p>

    <h2>Is Squirt Soda Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Based on the ingredients listed above, Squirt soda does not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. Additionally, Keurig Dr Pepper, the manufacturer of Squirt, has stated that their soda is gluten-free. This means that Squirt soda is safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity to consume.</p>

    <p>However, it's always a good idea to check the label for any changes in ingredients or manufacturing processes, as formulations can change over time. If you have severe gluten sensitivity, you may also want to contact the manufacturer directly for the most up-to-date information.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

    <p>While Squirt soda is considered gluten-free by its manufacturer, it does not carry an official gluten-free certification from organizations like the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). This certification involves rigorous testing and verification to ensure that a product contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

    <p>Despite the lack of certification, the absence of gluten-containing ingredients and the manufacturer's assurance make Squirt soda a safe choice for those avoiding gluten.</p>
