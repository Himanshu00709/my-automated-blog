<h1>Snapple Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by an increasing awareness of gluten-related health issues such as celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Snapple, a beloved brand known for its wide range of flavored teas and juices, has also joined the gluten-free movement. But what exactly does it mean for Snapple to be gluten-free? In this article, we’ll delve into the details of Snapple’s gluten-free offerings, their ingredients, and what you need to know if you’re following a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What Does Gluten-Free Mean?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale.
