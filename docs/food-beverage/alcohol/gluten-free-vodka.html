    <h1>Gluten-Free Vodka: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Among the many products that have come under scrutiny is vodka, a popular spirit that is often made from grains like wheat, barley, or ryeâ€”all of which contain gluten. However, not all vodka is off-limits for those avoiding gluten. In this article, we will explore the world of gluten-free vodka, including what makes vodka gluten-free, popular brands, and how to enjoy it responsibly.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Vodka Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Vodka is traditionally made by fermenting and distilling grains, which are then filtered and diluted to achieve the desired alcohol content. The distillation process is key to understanding whether vodka can be considered gluten-free. During distillation, the liquid is heated to create vapor, which is then condensed back into liquid form. This process theoretically removes gluten proteins, as they are too large to pass through the vapor. However, some experts argue that trace amounts of gluten may still remain, especially if the vodka is made from gluten-containing grains.</p>

    <p>For those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, even trace amounts of gluten can cause adverse reactions. Therefore, many people prefer vodka made from gluten-free ingredients such as potatoes, corn, grapes, or even quinoa. These vodkas are inherently gluten-free and are often labeled as such, providing peace of mind for those who need to avoid gluten entirely.</p>

    <h2>Popular Gluten-Free Vodka Brands</h2>
