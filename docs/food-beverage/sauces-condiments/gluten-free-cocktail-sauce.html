<h1>Gluten-Free Cocktail Sauce: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>When it comes to enjoying seafood, cocktail sauce is a classic accompaniment that adds a tangy, spicy kick to dishes like shrimp, crab, and oysters. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free cocktail sauce can be a challenge. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free cocktail sauce, from its ingredients to how you can make your own at home. Whether you’re hosting a dinner party or simply enjoying a quiet meal, this guide will ensure that your cocktail sauce is both delicious and safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten-Free Cocktail Sauce?</h2>
