<h1>Kraft Barbecue Sauce Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Barbecue sauce is a staple in many households, adding a tangy, sweet, and smoky flavor to a variety of dishes. For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free barbecue sauce can be a challenge. Kraft, a well-known brand in the condiment world, offers a range of barbecue sauces, but are they gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into Kraft barbecue sauce, its gluten-free options, and what you need to know to make an informed choice.</p>

<h2>What Makes a Barbecue Sauce Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For a barbecue sauce to be considered gluten-free, it must not contain any ingredients derived from these grains. Additionally, the sauce must be processed in a facility that avoids cross-contamination with gluten-containing products. Many barbecue sauces use ingredients like soy sauce or malt vinegar, which often contain gluten, so it’s essential to read labels carefully.</p>

<p>Kraft has been proactive in labeling their products clearly, making it easier for consumers to identify gluten-free options. However, it’s always a good idea to double-check the ingredients list and look for any gluten-free certifications on the packaging.</p>
