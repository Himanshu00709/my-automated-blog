<h1>Gluten-Free Condensed Milk: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Condensed milk is a staple in many kitchens, used in everything from desserts to beverages. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free version can be a challenge. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free condensed milk, including its benefits, how to make it at home, and where to buy it.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten-Free Condensed Milk?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free condensed milk is a thick, sweetened milk product that has been processed to remove any gluten-containing ingredients. Traditional condensed milk is made by evaporating most of the water from milk and adding sugar, but some brands may include additives or thickeners that contain gluten. Gluten-free condensed milk ensures that those with gluten sensitivities can enjoy this versatile ingredient without worry.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Condensed Milk?</h2>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health problems. Choosing gluten-free condensed milk allows these individuals to enjoy their favorite recipes without the risk of gluten exposure. Additionally, gluten-free products are often made with higher-quality ingredients, making them a healthier choice for everyone.</p>

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Condensed Milk at Home</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free condensed milk at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a simple recipe:</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>4 cups of whole milk (or a dairy-free alternative like almond or coconut milk)</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups of granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Pour the milk into a heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat it over medium heat until it starts to simmer.</li>
    <li>Add the sugar and stir until it dissolves completely.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until it reduces by about half. This should take around 1 to 1.5 hours.</li>
    <li>Once the mixture has thickened and turned a light caramel color, remove it from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract if using.</li>
    <li>Allow the condensed milk to cool before transferring it to an airtight container. It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.</li>
</ol>
