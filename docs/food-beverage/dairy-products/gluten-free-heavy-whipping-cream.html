    <h1>Gluten-Free Heavy Whipping Cream: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Heavy whipping cream is a staple in many kitchens, used for everything from baking to creating rich, creamy sauces. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding gluten-free heavy whipping cream can be a challenge. In this article, we’ll explore what gluten-free heavy whipping cream is, how to identify it, and how to use it in your cooking and baking.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Heavy Whipping Cream?</h2>

    <p>Heavy whipping cream is a dairy product that contains at least 36% milk fat. It is typically used in recipes to add richness and texture. Gluten-free heavy whipping cream is simply heavy whipping cream that has not been contaminated with gluten during processing. This is particularly important for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, as even trace amounts of gluten can cause adverse reactions.</p>

    <p>Most heavy whipping creams are naturally gluten-free, as they are made from milk and do not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, cross-contamination can occur during processing, so it’s important to look for products that are certified gluten-free.</p>
