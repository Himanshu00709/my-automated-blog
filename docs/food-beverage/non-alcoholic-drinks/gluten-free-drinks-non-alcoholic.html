    <h1>Gluten-Free Non-Alcoholic Drinks: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the general desire for healthier lifestyle choices. While much attention is given to gluten-free foods, gluten-free beverages, especially non-alcoholic ones, are equally important.

    <p>When it comes to drinks, gluten can be present in certain alcoholic beverages like beer, as well as in some non-alcoholic drinks that use barley malt or other gluten-containing ingredients. Therefore, it's crucial to understand which non-alcoholic drinks are safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>
