    <h1>Gluten-Free Non-Alcoholic Drinks: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the general desire for healthier lifestyle choices. While much attention is given to gluten-free foods, gluten-free beverages, particularly non-alcoholic ones, are equally important. Whether you're managing a gluten-free diet or simply exploring healthier drink options, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know about gluten-free non-alcoholic drinks.</p>

    <h2>What Does Gluten-Free Mean?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in grains like wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. A gluten-free diet eliminates all sources of gluten, which includes not only food but also beverages.</p>

    <p>When it comes to drinks, gluten can sometimes be hidden in unexpected places, such as flavorings, additives, or even processing methods. Therefore, it's crucial to understand which drinks are naturally gluten-free and which ones require careful scrutiny.</p>

    <h2>Naturally Gluten-Free Non-Alcoholic Drinks</h2>

    <p>Many non-alcoholic drinks are naturally free from gluten, making them safe for those on a gluten-free diet. Here are some popular options:</p>
