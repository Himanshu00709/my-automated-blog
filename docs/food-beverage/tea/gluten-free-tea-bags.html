    <h1>Gluten-Free Tea Bags: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. While many people focus on gluten-free foods, beverages like tea are often overlooked. However, for those who are highly sensitive to gluten, even the smallest trace can cause discomfort or health issues. This has led to the rise of gluten-free tea bags, a niche but essential product for many tea lovers. In this article, we will explore what gluten-free tea bags are, why they matter, and how to choose the best ones for your needs.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Tea Bags?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free tea bags are tea bags that are free from gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. While tea leaves themselves are naturally gluten-free, the tea bags and the adhesives used to seal them can sometimes contain gluten. This is particularly concerning for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, as even trace amounts of gluten can trigger adverse reactions.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free tea bags are made from materials that do not contain gluten, such as cornstarch-based fibers or other plant-based materials. Additionally, the adhesives used to seal the bags are also gluten-free, ensuring that the entire product is safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Tea Bags Matter</h2>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. While tea itself is naturally gluten-free, the tea bags can be a hidden source of gluten. This is because some tea bags are made with materials that contain gluten, or they may be processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products, leading to cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free tea bags provide peace of mind for those who need to avoid gluten. By choosing tea bags that are certified gluten-free, individuals can enjoy their favorite beverages without worrying about potential health risks. Additionally, gluten-free tea bags are often made from more natural and sustainable materials, making them a better choice for the environment as well.</p>

    <h2>How to Choose the Best Gluten-Free Tea Bags</h2>
