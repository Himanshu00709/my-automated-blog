<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Cocoa Bombs at Home</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free cocoa bombs at home is a fun and rewarding process. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create your own:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients</h3>
<p>Ensure all your ingredients are certified gluten-free. This includes the chocolate, cocoa powder, marshmallows, and any additional toppings or mix-ins.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Melt the Chocolate</h3>
<p>Melt the gluten-free chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl or using a double boiler. Stir frequently to ensure even melting and to prevent burning.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Mold the Chocolate</h3>
<p>Using a silicone mold, carefully spread the melted chocolate into the cavities to form the cocoa bomb shells. Make sure the chocolate coats the mold evenly. Allow the chocolate to set in the refrigerator for about 10-15 minutes.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Fill the Bombs</h3>
<p>Once the chocolate shells are set, remove them from the mold. Fill one half of the shell with gluten-free cocoa powder, marshmallows, and any other desired mix-ins.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Seal the Bombs</h3>
<p>Gently heat the edges of the chocolate shell to melt them slightly, then press the two halves together to seal the cocoa bomb. You can also use a small amount of melted chocolate to help seal the edges.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Decorate and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Decorate the outside of the cocoa bombs with gluten-free sprinkles or toppings. To enjoy, simply place a cocoa bomb in a mug, pour hot milk over it, and watch as it melts to reveal the delicious hot chocolate inside.</p>
