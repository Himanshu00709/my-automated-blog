    <h1>Gluten-Free Tea Cookies: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Tea cookies are a timeless treat, perfect for pairing with your favorite cup of tea or coffee. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying traditional tea cookies can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free tea cookies—a delicious alternative that allows everyone to indulge in this classic snack. In this blog post, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free tea cookies, from their benefits to recipes and tips for baking the perfect batch.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Tea Cookies?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free tea cookies are not just for those with gluten intolerance. They offer a lighter, often healthier option for anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues for some people. By opting for gluten-free tea cookies, you can enjoy a treat that’s easier on your stomach without sacrificing flavor or texture.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free baking has come a long way in recent years. With the availability of high-quality gluten-free flours and baking aids, it’s now easier than ever to create cookies that are just as delicious—if not more so—than their gluten-containing counterparts.</p>

    <h2>Key Ingredients for Gluten-Free Tea Cookies</h2>

    <p>When it comes to baking gluten-free tea cookies, the choice of ingredients is crucial. Here are some key components to consider:</p>

    <h2>Tips for Baking Perfect Gluten-Free Tea Cookies</h2>

    <p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit different from traditional baking. Here are some tips to ensure your cookies turn out perfectly:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Measure Accurately:</strong> Gluten-free flours can be denser than wheat flour, so it’s important to measure your ingredients carefully to avoid a dry or crumbly texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Binding Agent:</strong> Since gluten-free flours lack the elasticity of wheat flour, adding a binding agent like xanthan gum or psyllium husk can help hold the dough together.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Gluten-free dough can be stickier than regular dough. Chilling it before baking will make it easier to handle and help the cookies hold their shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overbake:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can dry out quickly, so keep a close eye on them and remove them from the oven as soon as they’re lightly golden around the edges.</li>
    </ul>
