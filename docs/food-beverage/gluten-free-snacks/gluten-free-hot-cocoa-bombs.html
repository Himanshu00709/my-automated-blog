<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Hot Cocoa Bombs</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free hot cocoa bombs is a fun and rewarding process. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create your own:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Melt the Chocolate</h3>
<p>Start by melting your gluten-free chocolate. You can use a double boiler or microwave it in short bursts, stirring frequently to avoid burning. Once melted, let it cool slightly.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Molds</h3>
<p>Using a silicone mold designed for hot cocoa bombs, spoon a small amount of melted chocolate into each cavity. Use the back of a spoon or a brush to spread the chocolate evenly, ensuring the entire cavity is coated. Place the molds in the refrigerator to set for about 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Fill the Bombs</h3>
<p>Once the chocolate shells are set, remove them from the molds. Fill one half of each shell with a tablespoon of gluten-free hot cocoa mix and a few gluten-free marshmallows. You can also add any optional add-ins at this stage.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Seal the Bombs</h3>
<p>To seal the bombs, gently heat the edges of the chocolate shells using a warm plate or your fingers. Press the two halves together, ensuring they are securely sealed. You can also drizzle a little extra melted chocolate around the seam for added strength.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Decorate and Serve</h3>
<p>Once the bombs are sealed, you can decorate them with additional melted chocolate, sprinkles, or crushed peppermint. Let them set completely before serving. To enjoy, simply place a bomb in a mug, pour hot milk over it, and watch as it melts into a delicious cup of hot cocoa.</p>
