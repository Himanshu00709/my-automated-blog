    <h1>Stolichnaya Gluten-Free Vodka: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Vodka has long been a staple in the world of spirits, known for its versatility and smooth taste. For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free vodka can be a challenge. Enter Stolichnaya, a brand that has gained a reputation for producing high-quality, gluten-free vodka. In this article, we will delve into the world of Stolichnaya gluten-free vodka, exploring its history, production process, and why it stands out in the crowded vodka market.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Stolichnaya Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Stolichnaya vodka is made from wheat and rye, which are grains that typically contain gluten. However, the distillation process used by Stolichnaya removes the gluten proteins, making the final product gluten-free. According to the FDA, distilled spirits made from gluten-containing grains can be labeled as gluten-free if the distillation process removes the gluten proteins to below 20 parts per million (ppm), which is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

    <p>Stolichnaya's distillation process involves multiple steps to ensure the purity and quality of the vodka. The grains are fermented, and the resulting liquid is distilled multiple times to remove impurities, including gluten proteins. The final product is then filtered through quartz sand and activated charcoal to further refine the vodka and ensure its smoothness.</p>

    <h2>The History of Stolichnaya Vodka</h2>

    <p>Stolichnaya, often referred to as "Stoli," has a rich history that dates back to the early 20th century. The brand was officially established in 1938 in the Soviet Union, although its origins can be traced back even further. Stolichnaya quickly became one of the most popular vodkas in Russia and eventually gained international recognition.</p>

    <p>In the 1970s, Stolichnaya was introduced to the United States, where it quickly became a favorite among vodka enthusiasts. The brand's commitment to quality and its distinctive taste helped it stand out in a competitive market. Today, Stolichnaya is produced in Latvia and is known for its wide range of flavored vodkas, as well as its classic, unflavored varieties.</p>
