        <th>Ingredient</th>
        <th>Quantity</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Gluten-free chocolate (dark, milk, or white)</td>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Melt the Chocolate:</strong> Begin by melting the gluten-free chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl or using a double boiler. Stir frequently to ensure even melting and avoid burning.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Molds:</strong> Using a silicone mold designed for hot chocolate bombs, spoon a small amount of melted chocolate into each cavity. Use a brush or the back of a spoon to spread the chocolate evenly, ensuring the entire cavity is coated. Allow the chocolate to set in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Fill the Bombs:</strong> Once the chocolate shells are set, carefully remove them from the molds. Fill one half of each shell with a tablespoon of gluten-free hot cocoa mix and a few mini marshmallows.</li>
    <li><strong>Seal the Bombs:</strong> Gently heat the edges of the chocolate shells using a warm plate or your fingers. Press the two halves together to seal the bomb, ensuring the fillings are securely enclosed.</li>
    <li><strong>Decorate:</strong> For an extra touch of flair, drizzle melted chocolate over the bombs and add gluten-free sprinkles or edible glitter. Allow the bombs to set completely before serving or storing.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Hot Chocolate Bombs</h2>

<p>Creating the perfect gluten-free hot chocolate bombs requires a bit of practice and attention to detail. Here are some tips to help you achieve the best results:</p>
