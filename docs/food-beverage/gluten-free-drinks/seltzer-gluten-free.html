<h1>Is Seltzer Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, seltzer has become a popular beverage choice for those seeking a refreshing, low-calorie alternative to sugary sodas and alcoholic drinks. With the rise of gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, many people are asking: <strong>Is seltzer gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the world of seltzer, explore its ingredients, and answer all your questions about its gluten-free status.</p>

<h2>What is Seltzer?</h2>
<p>Seltzer, also known as sparkling water or carbonated water, is a beverage made by infusing water with carbon dioxide under pressure. This process creates the fizzy bubbles that make seltzer so refreshing. Unlike tonic water or club soda, seltzer typically contains no added sugars, artificial flavors, or sweeteners, making it a healthier choice for many.</p>

<h2>Is Seltzer Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>
<p>Yes, seltzer is naturally gluten-free. The primary ingredients in seltzer are water and carbon dioxide, neither of which contains gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives, and since seltzer does not include these ingredients, it is inherently safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<p>However, it’s important to note that some flavored seltzers may contain additives or natural flavors that could introduce gluten. Always check the label or contact the manufacturer if you’re unsure about a specific product.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Seltzer Brands</h2>
