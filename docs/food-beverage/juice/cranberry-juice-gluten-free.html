    <h1>Cranberry Juice: A Gluten-Free Superfood</h1>
    <p>Cranberry juice has long been celebrated for its numerous health benefits, ranging from supporting urinary tract health to providing a rich source of antioxidants. For individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding safe and nutritious beverages can be a challenge. Fortunately, cranberry juice is naturally gluten-free, making it an excellent choice for those who need to avoid gluten. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free nature of cranberry juice, its health benefits, and how to incorporate it into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Cranberry Juice Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Cranberry juice is derived from cranberries, which are naturally gluten-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. Since cranberries are a fruit, they do not contain gluten. However, it's essential to be cautious when purchasing cranberry juice, as some brands may add ingredients or process their products in facilities that handle gluten-containing products. Always check the label for any gluten-containing additives or cross-contamination warnings.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Cranberry Juice</h2>
    <p>Cranberry juice is not only gluten-free but also packed with nutrients and health benefits. Here are some of the key benefits:</p>

    <h3>1. Rich in Antioxidants</h3>
    <p>Cranberries are loaded with antioxidants, particularly vitamin C and polyphenols. These compounds help combat oxidative stress and reduce inflammation in the body, which can lower the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer.</p>

    <h3>2. Supports Urinary Tract Health</h3>
    <p>One of the most well-known benefits of cranberry juice is its ability to support urinary tract health. The proanthocyanidins in cranberries prevent bacteria from adhering to the walls of the urinary tract, reducing the risk of infections.</p>

    <h3>3. Promotes Digestive Health</h3>
    <p>Cranberry juice contains dietary fiber, which aids in digestion and promotes a healthy gut. Additionally, the antioxidants in cranberries can help maintain a balanced gut microbiome.</p>

    <h3>4. Boosts Immune System</h3>
    <p>The high vitamin C content in cranberry juice helps strengthen the immune system, making it easier for your body to fight off infections and illnesses.</p>

    <h2>How to Choose the Right Cranberry Juice</h2>
    <p>When selecting cranberry juice, it's crucial to ensure that it is 100% pure and free from gluten-containing additives. Here are some tips to help you choose the right cranberry juice:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check the Label:</strong> Look for labels that explicitly state "gluten-free." This ensures that the product has been tested and certified to be free from gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Added Sugars:</strong> Some cranberry juices contain added sugars, which can negate the health benefits. Opt for unsweetened or low-sugar varieties.</li>
        <li><strong>Look for 100% Juice:</strong> Ensure that the product is made from 100% cranberry juice without any artificial flavors or preservatives.</li>
