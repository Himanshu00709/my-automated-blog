    <h1>Gluten-Free Gins: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Gin, a beloved spirit with a rich history, has seen a surge in popularity in recent years. With the rise of gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, many gin enthusiasts are seeking gluten-free options. But what exactly makes a gin gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free gins, from their production process to the best brands available on the market.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Gin Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gin is traditionally made from grains such as barley, wheat, or rye, which contain gluten. However, the distillation process plays a crucial role in determining whether a gin is gluten-free. During distillation, the liquid is heated, and the alcohol vapor is collected and condensed. Gluten proteins are too large to vaporize, so they are left behind in the distillation process. This means that even if a gin is made from gluten-containing grains, the final product may still be gluten-free.</p>
    <p>However, some people with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease may still react to trace amounts of gluten. For this reason, many distilleries now produce gins using gluten-free base ingredients such as potatoes, grapes, or corn. These gins are often labeled as "gluten-free" to assure consumers of their safety.</p>
