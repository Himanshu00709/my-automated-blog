<h1>Gluten-Free Soy Sauce: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or those simply choosing a gluten-free lifestyle, finding the right condiments can be a challenge. Soy sauce, a staple in many cuisines, traditionally contains wheat as a primary ingredient. However, the rise in demand for gluten-free products has led to the development of several gluten-free soy sauce brands. In this article, we will explore the best gluten-free soy sauce brands available, their unique features, and how they compare to traditional soy sauce.</p>

<h2>What Makes Soy Sauce Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Traditional soy sauce is made from fermented soybeans, wheat, salt, and water. The wheat component is what makes it unsuitable for those avoiding gluten. Gluten-free soy sauce, on the other hand, is made without wheat. Instead, it uses alternative grains like rice or other gluten-free ingredients to achieve a similar flavor profile. The fermentation process remains the same, ensuring that the umami-rich taste is preserved.</p>
