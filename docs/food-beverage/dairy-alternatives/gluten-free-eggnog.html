    <h1>Gluten-Free Eggnog: A Festive Delight for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Eggnog is a classic holiday beverage that brings warmth and cheer to any gathering. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional eggnog recipes can be a source of concern due to potential cross-contamination or hidden gluten ingredients. Fortunately, gluten-free eggnog is not only possible but also delicious and easy to make. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free eggnog, from its history to a step-by-step recipe, and answer some common questions about this festive drink.</p>

    <h2>The History of Eggnog</h2>
    <p>Eggnog has a rich history that dates back to medieval Europe. Originally known as "posset," a hot, milky, ale-like drink, it evolved over time into the creamy, spiced beverage we know today. The name "eggnog" is believed to have originated from the combination of "egg" and "nog," an old English term for a strong ale. When eggnog made its way to America, it became a holiday staple, often spiked with rum, brandy, or bourbon. Today, eggnog is enjoyed in many forms, including gluten-free versions that cater to dietary restrictions.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Eggnog?</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, fatigue, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Traditional eggnog recipes may contain gluten if they include additives, thickeners, or alcohol that has been processed with gluten-containing grains. By opting for gluten-free eggnog, you can enjoy this festive drink without worrying about adverse health effects. Plus, gluten-free eggnog can be just as rich, creamy, and flavorful as its traditional counterpart.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Eggnog</h2>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until the mixture is pale and thick.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan, heat the milk and heavy cream over medium heat until it begins to steam but does not boil.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the warm milk mixture into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly to prevent the eggs from curdling.</li>

        <li>Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract, nutmeg, and optional gluten-free alcohol.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps, then let it cool to room temperature.</li>
