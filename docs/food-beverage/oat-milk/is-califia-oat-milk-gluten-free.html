    <h1>Is Califia Oat Milk Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, oat milk has surged in popularity as a dairy-free alternative, and Califia Farms has been at the forefront of this trend. Known for its creamy texture and versatility, Califia oat milk is a favorite among vegans, lactose-intolerant individuals, and those simply looking to reduce their dairy intake. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, the question of whether Califia oat milk is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we’ll delve into the details, exploring the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications that determine whether Califia oat milk is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. As a result, individuals with these conditions must be vigilant about avoiding gluten in their diets.</p>

    <p>Oats themselves are naturally gluten-free, but they are often contaminated with gluten during growing, harvesting, or processing. This cross-contamination can occur if oats are grown near gluten-containing grains or processed in facilities that also handle wheat, barley, or rye. Therefore, it’s crucial to look for oat products that are certified gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Califia Oat Milk: Ingredients and Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

    <p>Califia Farms is a well-known brand that prides itself on producing high-quality, plant-based beverages. Their oat milk is made from a blend of oats, water, and a few additional ingredients to enhance flavor and texture. But is it gluten-free? Let’s break it down:</p>

            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
