    <h1>Canada Dry Gluten-Free: A Refreshing Choice for Everyone</h1>

    <p>When it comes to refreshing beverages, Canada Dry has been a household name for over a century. Known for its crisp and clean taste, Canada Dry ginger ale has been a favorite for many. But in recent years, as more people become aware of dietary restrictions and preferences, the question arises: Is Canada Dry gluten-free? The good news is that Canada Dry ginger ale is indeed gluten-free, making it a safe and enjoyable choice for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about Canada Dry’s gluten-free status, its ingredients, and why it’s a great option for anyone looking for a refreshing drink.</p>

    <h2>What Does Gluten-Free Mean?</h2>

    <p>Before diving into the specifics of Canada Dry, it’s important to understand what "gluten-free" means. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. A gluten-free diet eliminates these proteins, allowing individuals to avoid these adverse effects. The term "gluten-free" on a product label indicates that the product contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is considered safe for most people with gluten-related disorders.</p>

    <h2>Canada Dry Ingredients: A Closer Look</h2>

    <p>Canada Dry ginger ale is made from a simple list of ingredients, which includes carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, sodium benzoate (preservative), natural flavors, and caramel color. Notably, none of these ingredients contain gluten. Here’s a breakdown of the ingredients:</p>
