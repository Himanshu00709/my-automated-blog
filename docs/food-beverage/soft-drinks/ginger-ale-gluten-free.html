    <h1>Ginger Ale: A Gluten-Free Beverage Guide</h1>
    <p>Ginger ale has long been a popular beverage, known for its refreshing taste and potential health benefits. For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding gluten-free options is crucial. Fortunately, ginger ale is naturally gluten-free, making it a safe and enjoyable choice for many.

Always check the label or contact the manufacturer to ensure the product is gluten-free.</p>
