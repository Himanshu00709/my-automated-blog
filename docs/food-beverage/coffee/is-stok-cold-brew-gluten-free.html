    <h1>Is Stok Cold Brew Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Cold brew coffee has become a staple for many coffee enthusiasts, offering a smooth, less acidic alternative to traditional hot-brewed coffee. Among the popular brands, Stok Cold Brew has gained a loyal following for its rich flavor and convenience. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Is Stok Cold Brew gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to provide a comprehensive answer.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Presence in Beverages</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is commonly associated with bread, pasta, and baked goods, but it can also sneak into beverages through additives, flavorings, or cross-contamination during production. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, even trace amounts of gluten can trigger adverse reactions, making it crucial to scrutinize product labels and manufacturing practices.</p>

    <p>When it comes to coffee, the beans themselves are naturally gluten-free. However, the concern arises with flavored or processed coffee products, which may contain gluten-containing ingredients or be produced in facilities that handle gluten. This is why it’s essential to examine Stok Cold Brew’s ingredients and production methods.</p>

    <h2>Stok Cold Brew Ingredients and Gluten Content</h2>

    <p>Stok Cold Brew is known for its simplicity and high-quality ingredients. The primary components of their cold brew coffee include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Cold-brewed coffee</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Natural flavors (in flavored varieties)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>According to Stok’s official website and product labeling, their cold brew coffee is gluten-free. The company states that their products do not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, it’s important to note that Stok does not have a gluten-free certification, which means they do not test for gluten cross-contamination during production.</p>

    <h3>Flavored Varieties and Gluten</h3>

    <p>Stok offers several flavored cold brew options, such as Vanilla, Mocha, and Sweet Black. While these flavors are derived from natural sources, the term "natural flavors" can sometimes be ambiguous. In the case of Stok, the company confirms that their natural flavors do not contain gluten. However, if you have severe gluten sensitivity, it’s always a good idea to contact the manufacturer directly for more detailed information.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if a product’s ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can pose a risk. This occurs when gluten-free products are produced in facilities that also handle gluten-containing ingredients. Stok Cold Brew is manufactured in facilities that may process other products containing gluten. While the company takes precautions to prevent cross-contamination, they do not guarantee that their products are entirely free from gluten traces.</p>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance, this lack of certification and potential for cross-contamination may be a concern. In such cases, opting for certified gluten-free coffee brands might be a safer choice.</p>

    <h2>Comparison of Stok Cold Brew with Other Gluten-Free Coffee Brands</h2>

    <p>To provide a clearer picture, let’s compare Stok Cold Brew with other popular gluten-free coffee brands:</p>
