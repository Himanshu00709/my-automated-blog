    <h1>Complex Carbohydrates: A Gluten-Free Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free diets has surged, driven by both medical necessity and lifestyle choices. For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply opting for a gluten-free lifestyle, understanding the role of complex carbohydrates is crucial. Complex carbohydrates are an essential part of a balanced diet, providing sustained energy and numerous health benefits. This article delves into the world of complex carbohydrates, focusing on gluten-free options, their benefits, and how to incorporate them into your diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Complex Carbohydrates?</h2>
    <p>Complex carbohydrates are long chains of sugar molecules that are broken down slowly by the body, providing a steady release of energy. Unlike simple carbohydrates, which are quickly digested and can cause spikes in blood sugar levels, complex carbs are digested more slowly, helping to maintain stable energy levels and promote satiety. They are found in a variety of foods, including whole grains, legumes, and starchy vegetables.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Complex Carbohydrates</h2>
    <p>For those following a gluten-free diet, it's important to identify which complex carbohydrates are naturally free of gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Fortunately, there are many gluten-free complex carbohydrates that can be safely consumed. Below is a table of some common gluten-free complex carbohydrates:</p>
