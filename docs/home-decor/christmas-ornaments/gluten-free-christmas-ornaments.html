    <h1>Gluten-Free Christmas Ornaments: A Festive and Safe Holiday Tradition</h1>

    <p>The holiday season is a time for joy, family, and traditions. For many, decorating the Christmas tree is a cherished activity that brings everyone together. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the festive season can come with unexpected challenges. Gluten-free Christmas ornaments are a creative and safe way to ensure that everyone can participate in the holiday fun without worry. In this blog post, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free Christmas ornaments, from their importance to how you can make your own.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Christmas Ornaments Matter</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. While it’s commonly associated with food, gluten can also be present in non-food items, including some Christmas ornaments. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, even trace amounts of gluten can trigger adverse reactions. Traditional ornaments, especially those made from dough or containing wheat-based adhesives, can pose a risk. Gluten-free ornaments ensure that everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions, can enjoy the holiday season safely.</p>

    <h2>Types of Gluten-Free Christmas Ornaments</h2>

    <p>There are several types of gluten-free Christmas ornaments available, each offering a unique way to decorate your tree. Here are some popular options:</p>
