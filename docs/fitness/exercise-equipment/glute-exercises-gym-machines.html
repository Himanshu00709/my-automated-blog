<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. How often should I train my glutes?</h3>
    <p>For optimal results, aim to train your glutes 2-3 times per week. Allow at least 48 hours of rest between sessions to promote muscle recovery and growth.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I build glutes with just machines?</h3>
    <p>While machines are effective, incorporating free weights and bodyweight exercises can provide a more comprehensive workout. Combining different types of exercises will help you achieve balanced glute development.</p>

    <h3>3. What if I don't feel my glutes working during exercises?</h3>
    <p>If you're not feeling your glutes engage, it could be due to improper form or lack of mind-muscle connection. Focus on squeezing your glutes during each movement and consider reducing the weight to ensure proper technique.</p>

    <h3>4. Are glute exercises only for aesthetics?</h3>
    <p>No, glute exercises are not just for aesthetics. Strong glutes are essential for functional movements, athletic performance, and injury prevention. They also contribute to overall lower body strength and stability.</p>
