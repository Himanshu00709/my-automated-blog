    <h2>Key Exercises for Glute Transformation</h2>
    <p>Here’s a breakdown of the most effective exercises to include in your routine:</p>

    <h3>1. Squats</h3>
    <p>Squats are a compound movement that targets your glutes, quads, and hamstrings. Start with bodyweight squats and gradually add weights as you progress.</p>

    <h3>2. Hip Thrusts</h3>
    <p>Hip thrusts are one of the best exercises for glute activation. Use a barbell or resistance band to increase intensity.</p>

    <h3>3. Deadlifts</h3>
    <p>Deadlifts work your entire posterior chain, including your glutes. Focus on proper form to avoid injury.</p>

    <h3>4. Lunges</h3>
    <p>Lunges are excellent for targeting each glute individually. Try walking lunges or reverse lunges for variety.</p>
