<h1>Celebrities Who Are Gluten-Free</h1>

<p>In recent years, the gluten-free diet has gained significant popularity, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also among health-conscious individuals and celebrities. Many stars have adopted a gluten-free lifestyle for various reasons, including health benefits, weight management, and overall well-being.

<p>Many celebrities have reported feeling better after eliminating gluten from their diets, whether they have a medical condition or not. Let’s take a closer look at some of these stars and their gluten-free journeys.</p>
