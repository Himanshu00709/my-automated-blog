    <h1>Living Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Living gluten-free is more than just a dietary choice; for many, it's a necessity. Whether you have celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply want to explore a gluten-free lifestyle, understanding the ins and outs of this diet is crucial. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about living gluten-free, from the basics to advanced tips, and provide you with the tools to thrive on this journey.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It acts as a binding agent, giving dough its elasticity and helping it rise.

        <li><strong>Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity:</strong> A condition where individuals experience symptoms similar to celiac disease but without the intestinal damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Wheat Allergy:</strong> An allergic reaction to proteins found in wheat.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Preference:</strong> Some people choose a gluten-free diet for perceived health benefits or weight loss.</li>
