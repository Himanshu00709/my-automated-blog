    <h2>How Does a Gluta Drip Work?</h2>

    <p>The Gluta Drip is administered by a healthcare professional in a clinical setting. The process involves inserting a small needle into a vein, usually in the arm, and allowing the glutathione solution to drip slowly into the bloodstream. The entire procedure typically takes about 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the dosage and the individual's response.</p>

    <p>Once in the bloodstream, glutathione works to neutralize free radicals, reduce oxidative stress, and promote detoxification. The effects of the treatment can be seen within a few sessions, with many individuals reporting brighter skin, improved energy levels, and a general sense of well-being.</p>

    <h2>What to Expect During a Gluta Drip Session</h2>

    <p>If you're considering a Gluta Drip, it's important to know what to expect during your session. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Consultation:</strong> Before the treatment, you'll have a consultation with a healthcare provider to discuss your medical history, goals, and any potential risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> The area where the needle will be inserted is cleaned, and a tourniquet is applied to make the veins more visible.</li>
        <li><strong>Administration:</strong> The needle is inserted, and the glutathione solution is allowed to drip into your bloodstream.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Throughout the session, your vital signs may be monitored to ensure your safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Aftercare:</strong> After the drip is complete, the needle is removed, and you may be advised to rest for a short period before resuming your daily activities.</li>
    </ol>
