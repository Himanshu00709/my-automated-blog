    <h3>2. How often should I use glute straps?</h3>
    <p>It's recommended to use glute straps 2-3 times per week as part of a balanced workout routine. This frequency allows your muscles adequate time to recover and grow stronger.</p>

    <h3>3. Are glute straps suitable for beginners?</h3>
    <p>Yes, glute straps are suitable for beginners. Start with a lighter resistance band and focus on mastering proper form before progressing to heavier bands or more advanced exercises.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I use glute straps for upper body exercises?</h3>

    <p>To clean your glute straps, wipe them down with a damp cloth and mild soap after each use. Allow them to air dry completely before storing them in a cool, dry place. Avoid exposing the bands to direct sunlight or extreme temperatures, as this can cause them to degrade over time.</p>
