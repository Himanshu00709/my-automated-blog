    <h2>How to Use Glute Loops</h2>

    <p>Using glute loops is straightforward, but proper form and technique are essential to maximize their benefits. Here are some common exercises you can perform with glute loops:</p>

    <h3>1. Glute Bridges</h3>
    <p>Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place the glute loop just above your knees. Push through your heels to lift your hips towards the ceiling, squeezing your glutes at the top. Lower your hips back down and repeat.</p>

    <h3>2. Side-Lying Leg Lifts</h3>
    <p>Lie on your side with the glute loop around your thighs, just above your knees. Stack your legs and lift the top leg towards the ceiling, keeping it straight. Lower it back down and repeat on both sides.</p>

    <h3>3. Squats</h3>
    <p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and the glute loop placed just above your knees. Lower into a squat position, keeping your knees in line with your toes. Push through your heels to return to the starting position.</p>

    <h3>4. Clamshells</h3>
    <p>Lie on your side with your knees bent and the glute loop around your thighs. Keeping your feet together, open your top knee as far as you can, then close it. Repeat on both sides.</p>

    <h3>5. Lateral Walks</h3>
    <p>Place the glute loop just above your knees and stand in a semi-squat position. Take small steps to the side, maintaining tension in the band. Walk in one direction for a set number of steps, then return.</p>
