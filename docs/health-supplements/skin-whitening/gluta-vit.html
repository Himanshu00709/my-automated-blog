    <h2>How Does Gluta Vit Work?</h2>
    <p>Gluta Vit works by increasing the levels of glutathione in the body. When taken orally, the supplement is absorbed into the bloodstream and distributed to cells throughout the body. Once inside the cells, glutathione acts as a powerful antioxidant, neutralizing free radicals and preventing oxidative damage. It also supports the liver in detoxifying harmful substances and aids in the regeneration of other antioxidants like vitamins C and E.</p>

    <p>For skin whitening, Gluta Vit inhibits the enzyme tyrosinase, which is responsible for the production of melanin. By reducing melanin production, the skin becomes lighter and more radiant over time. Additionally, glutathione helps repair damaged skin cells, leading to a healthier and more youthful complexion.</p>

    <h2>Who Should Take Gluta Vit?</h2>
    <p>Gluta Vit is suitable for a wide range of individuals, including those looking to improve their skin tone, boost their immune system, or enhance their overall health. It is particularly beneficial for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Individuals with dull or uneven skin tone</li>
        <li>People exposed to environmental toxins or pollutants</li>
        <li>Those experiencing fatigue or low energy levels</li>
        <li>Individuals looking to support their liver health</li>
        <li>People seeking anti-aging solutions</li>
    </ul>
