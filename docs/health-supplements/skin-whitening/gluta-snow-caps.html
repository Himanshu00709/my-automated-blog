            <td>Known as the "master antioxidant," glutathione helps to lighten skin by inhibiting melanin production. It also detoxifies the body and boosts the immune system.</td>

    <h2>How Do Gluta Snow Caps Work?</h2>

    <p>Gluta Snow Caps work by targeting the root causes of skin discoloration and aging. The primary mechanism involves the inhibition of melanin production, which is responsible for skin pigmentation. Glutathione, the star ingredient, reduces the activity of the enzyme tyrosinase, which is involved in melanin synthesis. As a result, the skin becomes lighter and more even-toned over time.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the collagen and vitamin C in the capsules work synergistically to improve skin texture and elasticity. Collagen provides structural support to the skin, while vitamin C aids in collagen production and protects the skin from oxidative stress. Together, these ingredients help to achieve a brighter, smoother, and more youthful complexion.</p>

        <li><strong>Anti-Aging:</strong> The collagen and vitamin C in the capsules help to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, giving the skin a more youthful appearance.</li>
        <li><strong>Detoxification:</strong> Glutathione aids in detoxifying the body by neutralizing harmful free radicals and supporting liver function.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Skin Elasticity:</strong> Collagen helps to maintain skin elasticity, preventing sagging and promoting a firmer complexion.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Immune Function:</strong> The antioxidant properties of glutathione and vitamin C boost the immune system, helping the body to fight off infections and diseases.</li>
