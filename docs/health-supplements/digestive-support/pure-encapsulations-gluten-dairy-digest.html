Symptoms of these intolerances can range from bloating and gas to more severe gastrointestinal distress.</p>

    <p>For those who experience these symptoms, avoiding gluten and dairy entirely may not always be practical or desirable. This is where digestive aids like Pure Encapsulations Gluten Dairy Digest come into play.
