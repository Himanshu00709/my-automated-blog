<h1>Best Gluten-Free Lip Gloss: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free beauty products has surged, and for good reason. Many individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity are not only cautious about what they eat but also about what they apply to their skin and lips. Lip gloss, a staple in many makeup routines, is no exception. This guide will delve into the world of gluten-free lip gloss, exploring the best options available, what to look for, and why it matters.</p>
