    <p>Using Gluta Spray is simple and can be easily incorporated into your daily skincare routine. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cleanse Your Skin:</strong> Start by cleansing your face to remove any dirt, oil, or makeup. This ensures that the Gluta Spray can penetrate the skin effectively.</li>
