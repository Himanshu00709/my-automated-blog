<h2>How Does Gluta Brightening Underarm Cream Work?</h2>

<p>Gluta Brightening Underarm Cream works by targeting the root cause of dark underarms, which is often an overproduction of melanin. Melanin is the pigment responsible for the color of our skin, and when it is produced in excess, it can lead to darkening of the skin. The cream’s active ingredients, such as glutathione and kojic acid, inhibit the production of melanin, thereby lightening the skin over time.</p>

<p>Additionally, the cream contains moisturizing agents like aloe vera and niacinamide, which help to keep the skin hydrated and prevent irritation. This is particularly important for the underarm area, which is prone to friction and sweat, leading to further darkening and discomfort.</p>

<h2>How to Use Gluta Brightening Underarm Cream</h2>

<p>Using Gluta Brightening Underarm Cream is simple, but it’s important to follow the correct steps to achieve the best results. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Cleanse the Area:</strong> Start by thoroughly cleansing your underarms with a gentle soap or cleanser to remove any dirt, sweat, or deodorant residue.</li>
    <li><strong>Dry the Skin:</strong> Pat the area dry with a clean towel. Make sure the skin is completely dry before applying the cream.</li>
    <li><strong>Apply the Cream:</strong> Take a small amount of Gluta Brightening Underarm Cream and gently massage it into your underarms using circular motions. Ensure that the cream is evenly distributed.</li>
    <li><strong>Allow Absorption:</strong> Let the cream absorb into the skin for a few minutes before putting on any clothing. This will prevent the cream from rubbing off and ensure maximum absorption.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Regularly:</strong> For best results, use the cream twice daily—once in the morning and once at night. Consistency is key to achieving noticeable results.</li>
</ol>
