    <h2>How Does Luxxe White Gluta Work?</h2>

    <p>Additionally, the collagen and vitamin C in Luxxe White Gluta work together to improve skin texture and elasticity. Collagen helps to maintain the skin’s structural integrity, while vitamin C boosts collagen production and protects the skin from environmental damage. The result is a brighter, smoother, and more youthful complexion.</p>
