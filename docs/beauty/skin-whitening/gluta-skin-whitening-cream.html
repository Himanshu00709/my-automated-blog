<h2>How Does Gluta Skin Whitening Cream Work?</h2>

<p>Gluta Skin Whitening Cream works by targeting the root cause of hyperpigmentation: melanin production. Melanin is the pigment responsible for the color of our skin, hair, and eyes. When melanin is overproduced, it can lead to dark spots, uneven skin tone, and other forms of hyperpigmentation. The active ingredients in Gluta Skin Whitening Cream, such as glutathione and kojic acid, inhibit the enzyme tyrosinase, which is essential for melanin synthesis. By reducing melanin production, the cream helps to lighten the skin and fade dark spots over time.</p>

<p>Additionally, the cream contains antioxidants like Vitamin C, which protect the skin from free radical damage and promote collagen production. This not only helps to brighten the skin but also improves its overall texture and elasticity. Regular use of Gluta Skin Whitening Cream can result in a more even, radiant, and youthful complexion.</p>

<h2>How to Use Gluta Skin Whitening Cream</h2>

<p>To achieve the best results with Gluta Skin Whitening Cream, it is important to use it correctly. Follow these steps for optimal results:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Cleanse Your Skin:</strong> Start by cleansing your face with a gentle cleanser to remove dirt, oil, and makeup. Pat your skin dry with a clean towel.</li>
    <li><strong>Apply the Cream:</strong> Take a small amount of Gluta Skin Whitening Cream and apply it evenly to your face and neck. Gently massage the cream into your skin using upward circular motions.</li>
    <li><strong>Allow Absorption:</strong> Let the cream absorb into your skin for a few minutes before applying any other skincare products or makeup.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Sunscreen:</strong> Since the cream makes your skin more sensitive to sunlight, it is crucial to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 during the day to protect your skin from UV damage.</li>
</ol>

<p>For best results, use the cream twice daily, in the morning and evening. Consistency is key, and it may take several weeks to notice significant improvements in your skin tone and texture.</p>
