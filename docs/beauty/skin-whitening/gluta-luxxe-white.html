    <h2>How Does Gluta Luxxe White Work?</h2>
    <p>Gluta Luxxe White works by addressing the underlying causes of skin discoloration and aging. The primary mechanism of action involves the inhibition of melanin production. Melanin is the pigment responsible for skin color, and its overproduction can lead to dark spots, uneven skin tone, and hyperpigmentation. Glutathione, the star ingredient in Gluta Luxxe White, plays a crucial role in this process by inhibiting the enzyme tyrosinase, which is involved in melanin synthesis.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the combination of Collagen and Vitamin C helps to repair and rejuvenate the skin. Collagen provides structural support, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, while Vitamin C brightens the skin and protects it from environmental damage. Together, these ingredients work to create a brighter, more even complexion.</p>

        <li><strong>Anti-Aging:</strong> Boosts collagen production, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
