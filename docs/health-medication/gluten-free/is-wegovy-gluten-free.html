    <h1>Is Wegovy Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Wegovy, a brand-name medication containing semaglutide, has gained significant attention for its effectiveness in weight management. As more people turn to Wegovy to help with weight loss, questions about its ingredients and potential allergens, such as gluten, have become increasingly common. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, knowing whether Wegovy is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten content of Wegovy, its ingredients, and what you need to know before starting this medication.</p>

    <h2>What is Wegovy?</h2>
    <p>Wegovy is an injectable prescription medication approved by the FDA for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight individuals who have at least one weight-related condition, such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol. The active ingredient in Wegovy is semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that works by regulating appetite and food intake.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and long-term health complications. Therefore, it’s essential for these individuals to avoid gluten in medications, supplements, and food.</p>

    <h2>Is Wegovy Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>According to the manufacturer, Novo Nordisk, Wegovy does not contain gluten as an ingredient. However, it’s important to note that the medication is not explicitly labeled as "gluten-free." This is because pharmaceutical companies are not required to test for gluten in medications unless it is intentionally added as an ingredient. While Wegovy is unlikely to contain gluten, individuals with severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease should consult their healthcare provider before starting the medication.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Wegovy</h2>
