    <h1>Is Tylenol PM Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, ensuring that medications are gluten-free is crucial. Tylenol PM, a popular over-the-counter medication used for pain relief and sleep aid, is often questioned for its gluten content. In this article, we will delve into whether Tylenol PM is gluten-free, explore its ingredients, and provide essential information for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause severe health issues. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Gluten sensitivity, on the other hand, can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue without the intestinal damage seen in celiac disease.</p>

    <p>Given the potential health risks, it's essential for individuals with these conditions to avoid gluten in all forms, including medications. This brings us to the question: Is Tylenol PM gluten-free?</p>

    <h2>Is Tylenol PM Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>According to the manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, Tylenol PM does not contain gluten as an intentional ingredient. However, the company does not guarantee that the product is entirely gluten-free due to the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process. This is a common disclaimer for many medications, as they may be produced in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products.</p>

    <p>For most individuals with gluten sensitivity, the trace amounts of gluten that might be present due to cross-contamination are unlikely to cause a reaction. However, those with celiac disease should exercise caution and consult their healthcare provider before using Tylenol PM.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Tylenol PM</h2>
