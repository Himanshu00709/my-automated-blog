    <h1>Gluten-Free and Dairy-Free Candy: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with dietary restrictions such as gluten intolerance or lactose intolerance, finding safe and delicious treats can be a challenge. Candy, a beloved indulgence for many, often contains hidden ingredients like gluten or dairy that can cause discomfort or health issues. Fortunately, there are plenty of gluten-free and dairy-free candy options available that allow everyone to enjoy a sweet treat without worry. In this guide, we’ll explore what makes candy gluten-free and dairy-free, provide a list of popular options, and answer frequently asked questions to help you make informed choices.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Candy Gluten-Free and Dairy-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. Dairy refers to products derived from milk, such as lactose, casein, and whey. Candy can contain gluten or dairy in the form of flavorings, thickeners, or coatings. For example, some chocolates use milk powder, and certain gummy candies may contain wheat-based starch. To be considered gluten-free and dairy-free, candy must avoid these ingredients entirely and be produced in facilities that prevent cross-contamination.</p>
