<h1>Nut-Free and Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, dietary restrictions such as nut-free and gluten-free diets have gained significant attention. Whether due to allergies, intolerances, or personal health choices, many individuals are adopting these diets to improve their well-being. This guide will explore the essentials of nut-free and gluten-free living, offering practical tips, recipes, and insights to help you navigate these dietary choices with confidence.</p>

<h2>Understanding Nut-Free and Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

<p>Before diving into the specifics, it's essential to understand what nut-free and gluten-free diets entail. A <strong>nut-free diet</strong> eliminates all tree nuts and peanuts, which are common allergens. On the other hand, a <strong>gluten-free diet</strong> excludes gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Both diets require careful attention to food labels and ingredient lists to avoid cross-contamination and ensure safety.</p>

<h3>Why Choose a Nut-Free and Gluten-Free Diet?</h3>

<p>People adopt nut-free and gluten-free diets for various reasons:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Allergies:</strong> Nut and gluten allergies can cause severe reactions, including anaphylaxis.</li>
    <li><strong>Celiac Disease:</strong> An autoimmune disorder where gluten consumption damages the small intestine.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity:</strong> Individuals experience symptoms similar to celiac disease without the intestinal damage.</li>
    <li><strong>Health and Wellness:</strong> Some people find that eliminating nuts and gluten improves their overall health and energy levels.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Navigating a Nut-Free and Gluten-Free Lifestyle</h2>

<p>Adopting a nut-free and gluten-free lifestyle can seem daunting at first, but with the right knowledge and tools, it becomes manageable. Here are some key strategies:</p>

<table>

        <th>Ingredient</th>
        <th>Potential Source of Gluten/Nuts</th>

<h3>2. Safe Cooking Practices</h3>
