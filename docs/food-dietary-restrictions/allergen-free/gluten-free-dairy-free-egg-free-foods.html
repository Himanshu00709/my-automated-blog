    <h1>Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, and Egg-Free Foods: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free, dairy-free, and egg-free foods has surged, driven by dietary restrictions, allergies, and lifestyle choices. Whether you're managing celiac disease, lactose intolerance, or an egg allergy, or simply exploring a healthier way of eating, understanding the options available is crucial. This guide will walk you through the essentials of gluten-free, dairy-free, and egg-free diets, offering practical advice, food recommendations, and tips for maintaining a balanced and nutritious lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, and Egg-Free Diets</h2>

    <p>Before diving into food options, it's important to understand what these dietary restrictions entail:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free:</strong> Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. A gluten-free diet eliminates all foods containing these grains, which is essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Dairy-Free:</strong> A dairy-free diet excludes all milk and milk products, including cheese, yogurt, and butter. This is necessary for those with lactose intolerance or a milk allergy.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg-Free:</strong> An egg-free diet avoids all forms of eggs, which is crucial for individuals with an egg allergy or those following a vegan lifestyle.</li>
    </ul>
