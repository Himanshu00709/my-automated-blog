    <h1>Does Armour Thyroid Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Armour Thyroid is a popular prescription medication used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, understanding whether their medications contain gluten is crucial. In this article, we will explore whether Armour Thyroid contains gluten, its ingredients, and what you need to know if you are on a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Armour Thyroid?</h2>

    <p>Armour Thyroid is a natural desiccated thyroid extract derived from porcine (pig) thyroid glands. It contains both thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), the two primary hormones produced by the thyroid gland. This medication is often prescribed for patients who prefer a natural alternative to synthetic thyroid medications like levothyroxine.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Armour Thyroid</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Armour Thyroid contains gluten, it's essential to examine its ingredients. The primary active ingredient in Armour Thyroid is desiccated thyroid extract. The inactive ingredients include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Calcium stearate</li>
        <li>Dextrose</li>
        <li>Microcrystalline cellulose</li>
        <li>Mineral oil</li>
        <li>Colloidal silicon dioxide</li>
        <li>Stearic acid</li>
    </ul>

    <p>None of these ingredients are derived from gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, or rye. However, it's always a good idea to verify with the manufacturer or your healthcare provider to ensure there are no hidden sources of gluten.</p>

    <h2>Is Armour Thyroid Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>According to the manufacturer, Armour Thyroid does not contain gluten. The medication is formulated without gluten-containing ingredients, making it safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, cross-contamination during the manufacturing process is always a possibility, so it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider if you have severe gluten intolerance.</p>
