In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and other factors to determine whether Coricidin HBP is safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale.

This makes it essential for individuals with these conditions to carefully scrutinize the ingredients in their medications.</p>

    <p>Coricidin HBP is a line of over-the-counter medications designed to relieve cold and flu symptoms without raising blood pressure. It is specifically formulated for individuals with high blood pressure (HBP), as many cold medications contain ingredients that can elevate blood pressure. Coricidin HBP comes in various formulations, including tablets and liquids, each targeting specific symptoms such as cough, congestion, and fever.</p>
