    <h1>Does Advil Contain Gluten? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, ensuring that medications are gluten-free is crucial. Advil, a popular over-the-counter pain reliever, is often a go-to choice for many. But does Advil contain gluten? This article delves into the ingredients of Advil, its potential gluten content, and what you need to know to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even small amounts of gluten can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity can also cause similar symptoms, though without the intestinal damage.</p>

    <p>Given the potential health risks, it's essential for those with gluten-related disorders to scrutinize not just their food but also their medications. Many medications use gluten as a binding agent or filler, which can be a hidden source of gluten.</p>

    <h2>Advil: An Overview</h2>

    <p>Advil is a brand name for ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever. It's available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, and liquid gels. The active ingredient, ibuprofen, works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause inflammation and pain.</p>

    <p>While the active ingredient is gluten-free, the inactive ingredients in Advil can vary depending on the formulation. These inactive ingredients are used to give the medication its shape, color, and texture, and they can sometimes include gluten.</p>

    <h2>Does Advil Contain Gluten?</h2>

    <p>According to the manufacturer, Pfizer, Advil tablets and caplets do not contain gluten. However, it's important to note that this information pertains specifically to the standard Advil tablets and caplets. Other forms of Advil, such as Advil Liqui-Gels or Advil PM, may have different formulations, and their gluten content could vary.</p>

    <p>To ensure safety, always check the product label or contact the manufacturer directly. The table below provides a summary of the gluten content in different Advil products:</p>
