    <h2>Is Pepto-Bismol Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. The good news is that Pepto-Bismol does not contain gluten as a direct ingredient. According to the manufacturer, Procter & Gamble, Pepto-Bismol is formulated to be gluten-free. However, it’s always a good idea to check the label for any updates or changes in formulation, as manufacturers occasionally alter their recipes.</p>

    <p>For those with severe gluten intolerance, cross-contamination during manufacturing is a potential concern. While Pepto-Bismol is not known to be processed in facilities that handle gluten, individuals with celiac disease should consult their healthcare provider before using the product.</p>

    <h2>Is Pepto-Bismol Dairy-Free?</h2>

    <p>Dairy products contain lactose, which can cause digestive discomfort for individuals with lactose intolerance. Pepto-Bismol does not contain dairy or lactose as an ingredient, making it safe for most people with lactose intolerance. However, some formulations of Pepto-Bismol, such as chewable tablets, may contain trace amounts of lactose as a filler or binding agent. If you are highly sensitive to lactose, it’s advisable to opt for the liquid form of Pepto-Bismol, which is less likely to contain dairy-derived ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Potential Allergens in Pepto-Bismol</h2>

    <p>While Pepto-Bismol is generally considered safe for individuals with gluten and dairy sensitivities, it’s important to be aware of other potential allergens. Some formulations may contain artificial flavors or colorings that could trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. Additionally, the presence of salicylates in Pepto-Bismol may cause issues for those with aspirin allergies. Always read the label carefully and consult your doctor if you have any concerns.</p>
