    <h1>Is Zyrtec Gluten-Free in 2024? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, ensuring that medications are gluten-free is crucial. Zyrtec, a popular antihistamine, is often a go-to choice for allergy relief. But is Zyrtec gluten-free in 2024? This article delves into the details, providing you with the most up-to-date information on Zyrtec's gluten status, its ingredients, and what you need to know to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten in Medications</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, even trace amounts of gluten can trigger adverse reactions. While food products are often labeled for gluten content, medications are not always as transparent. This makes it essential to investigate the gluten status of any medication you take, including Zyrtec.</p>

    <h2>Is Zyrtec Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>As of 2024, Zyrtec (cetirizine hydrochloride) is considered gluten-free. The manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, has confirmed that Zyrtec does not contain gluten in its active or inactive ingredients. However, it's always a good practice to check the packaging or consult with a healthcare provider, especially if you have severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients in Zyrtec</h3>
    <p>To better understand why Zyrtec is gluten-free, let's take a closer look at its ingredients:</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Medications Matter</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to damage in the small intestine, resulting in malabsorption of nutrients and a host of other health issues. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. Therefore, ensuring that medications are gluten-free is not just a matter of preference but a necessity for maintaining health and well-being.</p>
