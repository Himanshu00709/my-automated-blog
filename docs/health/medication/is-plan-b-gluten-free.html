<h1>Is Plan B Gluten Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Plan B, often referred to as the "morning-after pill," is a widely used emergency contraceptive designed to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, understanding whether Plan B is gluten-free is crucial. This article delves into the details of Plan B's ingredients, its gluten-free status, and what you need to know if you're managing a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

<h2>What is Plan B?</h2>

<p>Plan B is an over-the-counter emergency contraceptive that contains levonorgestrel, a synthetic hormone that prevents ovulation, fertilization, or implantation of a fertilized egg. It is most effective when taken within 72 hours after unprotected sex, though it can still be effective up to 120 hours afterward. Given its critical role in reproductive health, it's essential to ensure that Plan B is safe for individuals with dietary restrictions, such as those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

<h2>Is Plan B Gluten Free?</h2>

<p>The good news for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity is that Plan B is considered gluten-free. The active ingredient, levonorgestrel, does not contain gluten, and the inactive ingredients used in the formulation are also free from gluten. However, it's always a good practice to check the packaging or consult with a healthcare provider to confirm the gluten-free status, especially if you have severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>

<h3>Ingredients in Plan B</h3>
