    <h1>Gluten-Free Cough Drops: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding gluten-free products is essential to maintaining their health and well-being. This includes not only food items but also over-the-counter medications and remedies, such as cough drops. Halls, a well-known brand in the cough drop market, offers a variety of products that cater to different needs. But are Halls cough drops gluten-free? In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of Halls cough drops, their ingredients, and what you need to know to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to avoid gluten in all forms, including medications and supplements.</p>

    <h2>Are Halls Cough Drops Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Halls is a popular brand that offers a wide range of cough drops designed to soothe sore throats and suppress coughs. The good news is that many Halls cough drops are gluten-free. However, it is essential to check the specific product and its ingredients, as formulations can vary. Below is a table summarizing the gluten-free status of some popular Halls cough drop varieties:</p>
