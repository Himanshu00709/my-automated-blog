    <h1>Is Theraflu Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>When it comes to managing cold and flu symptoms, Theraflu is a popular over-the-counter medication that many people turn to for relief. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, the question of whether Theraflu is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of Theraflu, explore its gluten-free status, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize the ingredients of any medication or food product they consume.</p>

    <h2>Is Theraflu Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Theraflu is a brand that offers a variety of products designed to alleviate cold and flu symptoms. These products come in different forms, including powders, liquids, and capsules. To determine whether Theraflu is gluten-free, we need to examine the ingredients of each product.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients in Theraflu Products</h3>

    <p>Theraflu products typically contain active ingredients such as acetaminophen (for pain relief and fever reduction), phenylephrine (a decongestant), and diphenhydramine (an antihistamine). In addition to these active ingredients, Theraflu products also contain inactive ingredients, which may include flavorings, colorings, and stabilizers. It is these inactive ingredients that are most likely to contain gluten.</p>
