    <h1>Is Prilosec Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Prilosec, a widely used medication for treating acid reflux and heartburn, is a staple in many households. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, the question of whether Prilosec is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will delve into the details of Prilosec's ingredients, its gluten-free status, and what you need to know to make an informed decision about its use.</p>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, the presence of gluten in medications can be a significant concern. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can trigger adverse reactions in those with gluten-related disorders. The good news is that Prilosec, in its standard formulation, is considered gluten-free. According to the manufacturer, Procter & Gamble, Prilosec OTC does not contain gluten as an ingredient.</p>
