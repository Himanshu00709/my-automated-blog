    <h1>Is Gaviscon Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gaviscon is a popular over-the-counter medication used to relieve symptoms of acid reflux, heartburn, and indigestion. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, ensuring that medications are gluten-free is crucial. This article delves into whether Gaviscon is gluten-free, its ingredients, and what you need to know to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even small amounts of gluten can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Therefore, it's essential for those with gluten-related disorders to avoid gluten in all forms, including medications.</p>

    <h2>Is Gaviscon Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gaviscon is manufactured by Reckitt Benckiser, and the company states that their Gaviscon products do not contain gluten as an intentional ingredient. However, they also note that they cannot guarantee that their products are entirely free from gluten due to the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process. This is a common disclaimer for many pharmaceutical products.</p>

    <p>For most people with gluten sensitivity, the trace amounts of gluten that might be present due to cross-contamination are unlikely to cause a reaction. However, individuals with celiac disease should consult their healthcare provider before using Gaviscon or any other medication.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Gaviscon</h2>

    <p>To better understand whether Gaviscon is safe for those avoiding gluten, let's take a closer look at its ingredients. Gaviscon contains active ingredients like aluminum hydroxide and magnesium carbonate, which help neutralize stomach acid. The inactive ingredients vary depending on the formulation (liquid, tablets, or chewable tablets), but they generally include:</p>
