    <p>When it comes to managing coughs and sore throats, Ricola cough drops have been a trusted remedy for decades. Known for their natural herb-infused formula, Ricola offers a soothing solution for many.

According to the manufacturer, Ricola products do not contain gluten ingredients, and they are manufactured in facilities that take precautions to avoid cross-contamination. This makes Ricola a safe choice for individuals who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <p>However, it’s always a good idea to check the packaging for any updates or changes in ingredients, as formulations can change over time. Ricola’s official website and customer service are also reliable sources for the most current information.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Ricola Cough Drops</h2>
