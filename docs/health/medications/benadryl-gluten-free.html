    <h1>Is Benadryl Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, ensuring that medications are gluten-free is crucial. Benadryl, a popular over-the-counter antihistamine, is often used to treat allergies, itching, and other symptoms. But is Benadryl gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients in Benadryl, its gluten-free status, and what you need to know to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, even trace amounts can trigger adverse reactions. Symptoms may include digestive issues, fatigue, skin rashes, and more. Therefore, it’s essential for these individuals to avoid gluten in all forms, including medications.</p>

    <h2>Is Benadryl Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Benadryl, also known by its generic name diphenhydramine, is available in various forms, including tablets, liquid gels, and liquid suspensions. According to the manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, most Benadryl products do not contain gluten as an intentional ingredient. However, they do not guarantee that their products are entirely free from gluten due to the potential for cross-contamination during manufacturing.</p>
