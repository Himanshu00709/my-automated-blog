    <h1>Do Mambas Have Gluten? A Detailed Exploration</h1>

    <p>Mambas are a popular chewy fruit candy that has been enjoyed by people around the world for decades. Known for their vibrant colors and fruity flavors, Mambas are a favorite among both children and adults. However, with the increasing awareness of gluten intolerance and celiac disease, many people are questioning whether Mambas contain gluten. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of Mambas, explore the concept of gluten, and provide a comprehensive answer to the question: Do Mambas have gluten?</p>

    <h2>What Are Mambas?</h2>

    <p>Mambas are a type of chewy fruit candy that originated in Germany. They are made primarily from fruit puree, sugar, and glucose syrup, which gives them their distinctive chewy texture. Mambas come in a variety of flavors, including strawberry, orange, lemon, and raspberry, and are often sold in small, individually wrapped pieces. The candy is known for its bright colors and intense fruit flavors, making it a popular choice for those with a sweet tooth.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in certain grains, including wheat, barley, and rye. It is responsible for the elastic texture of dough, allowing it to rise and maintain its shape. For most people, gluten is harmless and can be consumed without any issues. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and skin problems. As a result, many people are now seeking gluten-free alternatives to their favorite foods and snacks.</p>

    <h2>Do Mambas Contain Gluten?</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Mambas contain gluten, it is essential to examine their ingredients. The primary ingredients in Mambas include:</p>

            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
