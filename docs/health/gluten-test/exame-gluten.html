    <h1>Understanding Gluten: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Gluten has become a buzzword in the world of nutrition and health, but what exactly is it, and why does it matter? For some, gluten is a harmless protein found in many everyday foods. For others, it can be the source of serious health issues. In this article, we will explore what gluten is, its effects on the body, and how to determine if you need to avoid it. Whether you're considering a gluten-free diet or simply want to learn more, this guide will provide you with the information you need.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a family of proteins found in grains such as wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. The two main proteins in gluten are <strong>glutenin</strong> and <strong>gliadin</strong>, with gliadin being responsible for most of the adverse health effects. Gluten acts as a glue that helps foods maintain their shape, giving bread its chewy texture and allowing dough to rise. While gluten is harmless for most people, it can cause serious health issues for those with certain conditions.</p>

    <h2>Who Should Avoid Gluten?</h2>
    <p>Not everyone needs to avoid gluten, but for some individuals, it is essential. The following conditions are associated with gluten sensitivity or intolerance:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Celiac Disease:</strong> An autoimmune disorder where gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS):</strong> A condition where individuals experience symptoms similar to celiac disease but without the intestinal damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Wheat Allergy:</strong> An allergic reaction to proteins found in wheat, which may include gluten.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Symptoms of Gluten Intolerance</h2>
    <p>If you suspect you may have a gluten intolerance, it's important to recognize the symptoms. These can vary widely and may include:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Symptom</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Digestive Issues</td>
                <td>Bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Fatigue</td>
                <td>Feeling tired or sluggish after consuming gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Skin Problems</td>
                <td>Rashes, eczema, or dermatitis herpetiformis.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Headaches</td>
                <td>Frequent migraines or tension headaches.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Joint Pain</td>
                <td>Inflammation and discomfort in the joints.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>How to Test for Gluten Intolerance</h2>
    <p>If you suspect you have a gluten intolerance, there are several ways to test for it. The most common methods include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blood Tests:</strong> These can detect antibodies associated with celiac disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Endoscopy:</strong> A biopsy of the small intestine to check for damage caused by celiac disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Elimination Diet:</strong> Removing gluten from your diet for a period of time to see if symptoms improve.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's important to consult with a healthcare professional before making any dietary changes or self-diagnosing.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Diet: What to Eat and Avoid</h2>
    <p>If you need to follow a gluten-free diet, it's essential to know which foods are safe and which to avoid. Here's a quick guide:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>

                <td>Processed foods with hidden gluten</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Gluten-free grains (quinoa, rice, corn)</td>
                <td>Beer and malt beverages</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
