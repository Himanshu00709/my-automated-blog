<h1>Gas-X Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Gas-X is a popular over-the-counter medication designed to relieve symptoms of gas, such as bloating, pressure, and discomfort. For individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding gluten-free medications is crucial to avoid adverse reactions. This article delves into the specifics of Gas-X, its gluten-free status, and how it can be a safe option for those on a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What is Gas-X?</h2>

<p>Gas-X contains simethicone as its active ingredient, which works by breaking up gas bubbles in the stomach and intestines, making it easier for the body to expel them.
