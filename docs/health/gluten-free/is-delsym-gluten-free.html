<h1>Is Delsym Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>When it comes to managing coughs and colds, Delsym is a popular over-the-counter medication known for its effectiveness. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether Delsym is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of Delsym, its gluten-free status, and what you need to know to make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to ensure that the medications they consume are free from gluten.</p>

<h2>What is Delsym?</h2>

<p>Delsym is a brand of cough suppressant that contains dextromethorphan polistirex as its active ingredient. It is designed to provide long-lasting relief from coughs, making it a popular choice for both adults and children. Delsym is available in various forms, including liquid suspensions and extended-release tablets.</p>

<h2>Is Delsym Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>According to the manufacturer, Reckitt Benckiser, Delsym is gluten-free. The company has stated that their Delsym products do not contain gluten ingredients. However, it is always advisable to check the label and consult with a healthcare provider if you have any concerns, especially if you have severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>

<h3>Ingredients in Delsym</h3>

<p>To better understand whether Delsym is safe for those avoiding gluten, let's take a closer look at its ingredients. The primary active ingredient, dextromethorphan polistirex, is gluten-free. The inactive ingredients, which may vary depending on the specific product, typically include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Purified water</li>
    <li>Sucrose</li>
    <li>Glycerin</li>
    <li>Propylene glycol</li>
    <li>Citric acid</li>
    <li>Sodium benzoate</li>
    <li>Artificial flavors</li>
    <li>Artificial colors</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these ingredients contain gluten, which supports the manufacturer's claim that Delsym is gluten-free.</p>

<h2>Potential Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

<p>While the ingredients in Delsym are gluten-free, there is always a risk of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process. Cross-contamination can occur if the same equipment is used to produce both gluten-containing and gluten-free products. However, Reckitt Benckiser has not reported any issues with cross-contamination in their Delsym products. If you are highly sensitive to gluten, it may be worth contacting the manufacturer directly for more detailed information.</p>
