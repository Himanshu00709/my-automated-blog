    <h1>Is Airborne Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, ensuring that every product they consume is gluten-free is crucial. One popular product that often comes into question is Airborne, a dietary supplement designed to support the immune system. But is Airborne gluten-free? In this article, we will delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential risks associated with Airborne to determine whether it is safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even small amounts of gluten can cause symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity can also cause similar symptoms, though without the intestinal damage. Therefore, it is essential for these individuals to avoid gluten in all forms, including hidden sources in supplements and medications.</p>

    <h2>What is Airborne?</h2>

    <p>Airborne is a dietary supplement that was originally created by a schoolteacher who wanted to boost her immune system during cold and flu season. It contains a blend of vitamins, minerals, and herbs, including vitamin C, zinc, and echinacea, which are believed to support immune health. Airborne is available in various forms, including tablets, gummies, and powders, making it a convenient option for those looking to bolster their immune system.</p>

    <h2>Is Airborne Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The question of whether Airborne is gluten-free is a common one, especially among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. To answer this, we need to look at the ingredients and the manufacturing process.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients in Airborne</h3>

    <p>Airborne's ingredients vary slightly depending on the specific product, but the core ingredients typically include:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Source</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free?</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Vitamin C</td>
                <td>Synthetic or derived from fruits</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Zinc</td>
                <td>Mineral source</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Echinacea</td>
                <td>Herbal extract</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Other Herbs</td>
                <td>Various plant sources</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Fillers and Binders</td>
                <td>May include starches or cellulose</td>
                <td>Check for gluten-containing sources</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
