    <h1>Air Fryer Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the air fryer has become a kitchen staple for many households. Its ability to cook food quickly and with less oil makes it a healthier alternative to traditional frying methods. For those following a gluten-free diet, the air fryer can be a game-changer. This guide will explore how to make the most of your air fryer for gluten-free cooking, including tips, recipes, and FAQs.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose an Air Fryer for Gluten-Free Cooking?</h2>
    <p>Air fryers are particularly well-suited for gluten-free cooking for several reasons. First, they cook food evenly and quickly, which is ideal for gluten-free items that can sometimes be tricky to get just right.

Finally, the compact size of most air fryers means they are easy to clean, reducing the risk of cross-contamination with gluten-containing foods.</p>

        <li><strong>Avoid Cross-Contamination:</strong> If you share your air fryer with others, make sure to clean it thoroughly before using it for gluten-free cooking. Consider using separate baskets or liners if possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Coatings:</strong> Gluten-free coatings can be made from a variety of ingredients, such as almond flour, cornmeal, or gluten-free breadcrumbs. Experiment to find the texture and flavor you prefer.</li>
