<h2>What to Look for When Buying Gluten-Free Croutons</h2>

<p>When shopping for gluten-free croutons, it’s important to read labels carefully. Here are some key factors to consider:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Certification:</strong> Look for products that are certified gluten-free by a reputable organization, such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). This ensures that the product meets strict gluten-free standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Check the ingredient list for any hidden sources of gluten, such as malt or modified food starch. Opt for croutons made with whole grains like quinoa, rice, or corn.</li>
    <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> Gluten-free croutons come in a variety of flavors, from classic garlic and herb to more unique options like rosemary and olive oil. Choose a flavor that complements your dishes.</li>
    <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Some gluten-free croutons can be softer or denser than traditional croutons. If you prefer a crunchier texture, look for brands that specifically mention a crispy texture.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making Your Own Gluten-Free Croutons</h2>

<p>If you can’t find gluten-free croutons in stores or simply prefer to make your own, it’s easier than you might think. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Choose Your Bread:</strong> Start with a gluten-free bread of your choice. Look for a sturdy bread that will hold up well when cubed and baked.</li>
    <li><strong>Cube the Bread:</strong> Cut the bread into small, bite-sized cubes. Aim for uniformity to ensure even baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Season:</strong> Toss the bread cubes with olive oil and your favorite seasonings. Garlic powder, onion powder, dried herbs, and a pinch of salt are great options.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Spread the seasoned bread cubes on a baking sheet and bake at 375°F (190°C) for about 15-20 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Stir halfway through to ensure even baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and Store:</strong> Allow the croutons to cool completely before storing them in an airtight container. They should stay fresh for up to a week.</li>
</ol>
