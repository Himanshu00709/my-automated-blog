    <h2>Why Gluten-Free and Dairy-Free Gifts Matter</h2>
    <p>For those with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or lactose intolerance, consuming gluten or dairy can lead to serious health issues. Even small amounts of these ingredients can cause discomfort, digestive problems, or allergic reactions. By choosing gluten-free and dairy-free gifts, you show that you care about their health and well-being. It’s a thoughtful way to acknowledge their dietary needs and make them feel included in celebrations and gatherings.</p>
