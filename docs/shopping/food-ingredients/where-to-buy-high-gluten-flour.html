<h1>Where to Buy High Gluten Flour: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>High gluten flour is a staple for bakers who want to achieve that perfect chewy texture in their bread, bagels, and pizza dough. Unlike all-purpose flour, high gluten flour contains a higher protein content, typically around 14-15%, which is essential for developing strong gluten networks. This makes it ideal for recipes that require a lot of elasticity and structure. But where can you buy high gluten flour? In this guide, we’ll explore the best places to purchase this specialty flour, whether you’re shopping online or in-store.</p>

<h2>What is High Gluten Flour?</h2>

<p>High gluten flour is a type of wheat flour that has a higher protein content compared to other flours.

This makes it particularly useful for baking bread, bagels, and pizza crusts, where a chewy texture is desired. The high protein content also helps the dough retain its shape during baking, resulting in a well-risen and structured final product.</p>
