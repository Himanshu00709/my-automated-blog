    <h1>The Main Reason for Pearl Harbor</h1>
    <p>The attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, was a pivotal moment in world history, marking the United States' entry into World War II. But what were the underlying reasons that led Japan to launch such a devastating assault? This blog post delves into the historical, political, and economic factors that culminated in the attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>

    <h2>Historical Context</h2>
    <p>To understand the attack on Pearl Harbor, it's essential to look at the historical context. Japan had been expanding its empire in Asia and the Pacific throughout the early 20th century. The country sought to secure resources and establish dominance in the region, which led to conflicts with other nations, including China and the Soviet Union.</p>

    <h2>Economic Factors</h2>
    <p>One of the primary reasons for Japan's aggressive expansion was its need for natural resources. Japan is an island nation with limited natural resources, and by the 1930s, it was heavily reliant on imports of oil, iron, and rubber. The United States, along with other Western powers, imposed economic sanctions on Japan, including an oil embargo, which severely impacted Japan's ability to sustain its military campaigns.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Resource</th>
                <th>Import Dependency</th>
                <th>Impact of Sanctions</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Oil</td>
                <td>80%</td>
                <td>Severe shortage, crippling military operations</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Iron</td>
                <td>70%</td>
                <td>Limited production of weapons and machinery</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rubber</td>
                <td>90%</td>
                <td>Hindered production of tires and other essential goods</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Political Tensions</h2>
    <p>Political tensions between Japan and the United States were also a significant factor. The U.S. had been supporting China in its resistance against Japanese aggression, which further strained relations. Additionally, Japan's alliance with Germany and Italy through the Tripartite Pact created a sense of urgency for the U.S. to act against Japan.</p>

    <h2>Military Strategy</h2>
    <p>From a military perspective, Japan believed that a preemptive strike on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor would cripple American naval power and give Japan the upper hand in the Pacific. The attack was intended to buy Japan time to consolidate its gains in Southeast Asia and the Pacific without immediate interference from the U.S.</p>

    <h2>The Attack on Pearl Harbor</h2>
    <p>On the morning of December 7, 1941, Japanese forces launched a surprise attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The attack resulted in the destruction of numerous ships, aircraft, and infrastructure, and caused significant loss of life. The following table provides a summary of the damage inflicted during the attack:</p>

        <p>The attack on Pearl Harbor was a complex event driven by a combination of historical, economic, political, and military factors.
