    <h2>Getting Started with Badminton</h2>
    <p>Before you step onto the court, it's essential to understand the basic equipment and setup required to play badminton.</p>

    <h3>Equipment Needed</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Racket:</strong> A lightweight racket designed specifically for badminton.</li>
        <li><strong>Shuttlecock:</strong> Also known as a "birdie," this is the projectile used in the game.</li>
        <li><strong>Court:</strong> A rectangular court divided by a net, with specific dimensions for singles and doubles play.</li>
        <li><strong>Proper Footwear:</strong> Non-marking shoes with good grip to prevent slipping.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Court Dimensions</h3>

        <thead>

                <th>Court Width</th>

            </tr>

    <h2>Basic Rules of Badminton</h2>
    <p>Understanding the rules is crucial to playing badminton effectively. Here are some of the fundamental rules:</p>

    <h3>Scoring System</h3>
    <p>Badminton matches are typically played in a best-of-three games format. Each game is played to 21 points, and a player must win by at least 2 points. If the score reaches 29-29, the first to reach 30 points wins the game.</p>

    <h3>Serving Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The serve must be hit diagonally across the net.</li>
        <li>The server's feet must remain in contact with the ground during the serve.</li>
        <li>In singles, the server serves from the right service court when their score is even and from the left when it's odd.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Faults</h3>
    <p>A fault occurs when a player violates the rules, resulting in a point for the opponent. Common faults include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hitting the shuttlecock out of bounds.</li>
        <li>Failing to hit the shuttlecock over the net.</li>
        <li>Touching the net with the racket or body during play.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Techniques and Strategies</h2>
    <p>Mastering badminton requires a combination of proper techniques and strategic thinking. Here are some key techniques and strategies to improve your game:</p>

    <h3>Grip and Stance</h3>
    <p>The way you hold your racket and position your body can significantly impact your performance. The most common grip is the "forehand grip," which allows for powerful shots and quick transitions. Your stance should be balanced, with knees slightly bent and weight evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Basic Shots</h3>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Shot Type</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Clear</td>
                <td>A high, deep shot that sends the shuttlecock to the back of the opponent's court.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Drop Shot</td>
                <td>A soft shot that lands just over the net, forcing the opponent to move forward.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Smash</td>
                <td>A powerful, downward shot aimed at winning the point outright.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Drive</td>
                <td>A fast, flat shot that travels horizontally over the net.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Footwork</h3>
    <p>Good footwork is essential for reaching the shuttlecock quickly and maintaining balance. Practice moving efficiently around the court, using small, quick steps to position yourself for each shot.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. What is the best way to improve my badminton skills?</h3>
        <p>Consistent practice is key. Focus on mastering basic techniques, such as grip, stance, and footwork, before moving on to advanced strategies. Playing regularly with more experienced players can also help you improve.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>2. Can I play badminton indoors and outdoors?</h3>

    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>3. How do I choose the right badminton racket?</h3>
