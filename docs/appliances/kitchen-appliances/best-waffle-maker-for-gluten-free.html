    <h2>What to Look for in a Gluten-Free Waffle Maker</h2>

    <p>When shopping for a waffle maker specifically for gluten-free waffles, there are several key features to consider:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adjustable Temperature Control:</strong> Gluten-free batters often require precise temperature control to cook evenly without burning.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Stick Plates:</strong> Non-stick surfaces are essential for easy removal of gluten-free waffles, which can be more delicate than traditional waffles.</li>
        <li><strong>Even Heat Distribution:</strong> Look for a waffle maker that distributes heat evenly to avoid undercooked or overcooked spots.</li>
        <li><strong>Easy to Clean:</strong> Gluten-free batters can be sticky, so a waffle maker that’s easy to clean will save you time and effort.</li>
        <li><strong>Dedicated Use:</strong> If you have celiac disease, consider a waffle maker that’s exclusively used for gluten-free cooking to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for Making Perfect Gluten-Free Waffles</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free waffles can be a bit tricky, but with the right techniques, you can achieve delicious results. Here are some tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. A blend of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch often works well.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Xanthan Gum:</strong> Xanthan gum helps to bind the ingredients together, giving your waffles a better texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough waffles. Mix the batter just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Batter Rest:</strong> Allowing the batter to rest for 10-15 minutes before cooking can help the flours hydrate and improve the texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Waffle Maker:</strong> A properly preheated waffle maker ensures even cooking and prevents sticking.</li>
    </ul>
