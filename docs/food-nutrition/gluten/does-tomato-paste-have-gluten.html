    <h1>Does Tomato Paste Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Tomato paste is a staple in many kitchens, used to add depth and richness to a variety of dishes. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether tomato paste contains gluten is an important one. In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients in tomato paste, how it’s made, and whether it’s safe for a gluten-free diet. We’ll also provide tips on how to ensure the tomato paste you buy is gluten-free and answer some frequently asked questions on the topic.</p>

    <h2>What is Tomato Paste?</h2>

    <p>Tomato paste is a concentrated form of tomatoes that has been cooked down to remove most of the water content. It’s made by cooking tomatoes for several hours, straining out the seeds and skins, and then reducing the liquid until it becomes a thick, rich paste. The result is a product that is intensely flavorful and can be used to enhance the taste of soups, stews, sauces, and more.</p>

    <p>Tomato paste is typically made from just two ingredients: tomatoes and salt. However, some brands may add additional ingredients like citric acid, sugar, or spices to enhance flavor or extend shelf life. It’s these additional ingredients that could potentially introduce gluten into the product.</p>

    <h2>Is Tomato Paste Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>In its purest form, tomato paste is naturally gluten-free. Tomatoes themselves do not contain gluten, and the basic process of making tomato paste does not involve any gluten-containing ingredients. However, the gluten-free status of tomato paste can be compromised if the product contains additives or is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing foods.</p>

    <p>Here’s a breakdown of potential sources of gluten in tomato paste:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Potential Source</th>
                <th>Explanation</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Additives</td>
                <td>Some tomato paste brands may include additives like modified food starch, which can be derived from wheat and therefore contain gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cross-Contamination</td>
                <td>If the tomato paste is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing products, there is a risk of cross-contamination.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Flavor Enhancers</td>
                <td>Some brands may add flavor enhancers or thickeners that contain gluten.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
