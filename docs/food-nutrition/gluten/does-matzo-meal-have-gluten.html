<h1>Does Matzo Meal Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Matzo meal is a staple in Jewish cuisine, particularly during Passover. It is made from matzo, a type of unleavened bread that is central to the Passover tradition. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether matzo meal contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we will explore the composition of matzo meal, its gluten content, and alternatives for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

<h2>What is Matzo Meal?</h2>

<p>Matzo meal is a finely ground product made from matzo, which is a type of cracker-like bread that is unleavened. Matzo itself is made from flour and water, and it is baked quickly to prevent fermentation. The flour used in traditional matzo is typically wheat flour, which is a primary source of gluten. Matzo meal is often used as a breadcrumb substitute in recipes, particularly during Passover when leavened bread is prohibited.</p>

<h2>Does Matzo Meal Contain Gluten?</h2>

<p>Yes, traditional matzo meal contains gluten. Since matzo is made from wheat flour, the resulting matzo meal also contains gluten. Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it is responsible for the elastic texture of dough. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine.</p>
