    <h1>Does Condensed Milk Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Condensed milk is a staple in many kitchens, known for its rich, creamy texture and sweet flavor. It's commonly used in desserts, beverages, and even some savory dishes. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding whether condensed milk contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we'll explore the gluten content in condensed milk, how it's made, and what to look for when purchasing it.</p>

    <h2>What is Condensed Milk?</h2>

    <p>Condensed milk is a form of milk that has been reduced by removing about 60% of its water content. It is then sweetened with sugar, giving it a thick, syrupy consistency. The process of condensing milk involves heating it to evaporate the water, which also helps to preserve it. The result is a product that can be stored for long periods without refrigeration, making it a convenient ingredient for various recipes.</p>

    <h2>How is Condensed Milk Made?</h2>

    <p>The production of condensed milk involves several steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Milk Selection:</strong> High-quality milk is selected and pasteurized to kill any harmful bacteria.</li>
        <li><strong>Evaporation:</strong> The milk is heated to evaporate a significant portion of its water content.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar Addition:</strong> Sugar is added to the concentrated milk, which not only sweetens it but also acts as a preservative.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooling and Packaging:</strong> The condensed milk is then cooled and packaged in cans or tubes for distribution.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Does Condensed Milk Contain Gluten?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is commonly present in foods like bread, pasta, and cereals. However, condensed milk is made from milk and sugar, both of which are naturally gluten-free. Therefore, in its pure form, condensed milk does not contain gluten.</p>

    <p>However, it's essential to consider the possibility of cross-contamination or the addition of gluten-containing ingredients in some brands. For example, flavored condensed milk products might include additives or thickeners that contain gluten. Always check the label for any gluten-containing ingredients or warnings about cross-contamination.</p>
