<h1>Does Kikkoman Have Gluten? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>Kikkoman soy sauce is a staple in many kitchens around the world, known for its rich flavor and versatility. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether Kikkoman contains gluten is of paramount importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of Kikkoman soy sauce, explore its gluten content, and provide alternatives for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye.

Therefore, it is crucial for individuals with these conditions to carefully scrutinize the ingredients of the foods they consume.</p>
