<h1>Does Pesto Sauce Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Pesto sauce, with its vibrant green color and rich, herbaceous flavor, is a beloved condiment in many kitchens. Originating from Genoa, Italy, traditional pesto is made from fresh basil, pine nuts, garlic, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil. However, as gluten-free diets become increasingly popular, many people are asking: <strong>Does pesto sauce have gluten?</strong> In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients of pesto, potential sources of gluten, and how to ensure your pesto is gluten-free.</p>

<h2>What is Pesto Sauce?</h2>

<p>Pesto sauce is a versatile condiment that can be used in pasta dishes, sandwiches, salads, and more. The classic recipe, known as <em>Pesto alla Genovese</em>, includes the following ingredients:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
    <li>Pine nuts</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
</ul>

<p>These ingredients are typically blended together to create a smooth, flavorful sauce. However, variations of pesto may include different nuts, cheeses, or additional herbs, which can affect its gluten content.</p>

<h2>Is Traditional Pesto Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>At its core, traditional pesto is naturally gluten-free. None of the primary ingredients—basil, pine nuts, garlic, Parmesan cheese, or olive oil—contain gluten. However, the gluten-free status of pesto can be compromised depending on how it’s prepared or if additional ingredients are added.</p>

<p>For example, some store-bought pesto sauces may include thickeners, preservatives, or flavor enhancers that contain gluten. Additionally, cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing if the pesto is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing products.</p>

<h3>Potential Sources of Gluten in Pesto</h3>

<p>While traditional pesto is gluten-free, here are some potential sources of gluten to watch out for:</p>
