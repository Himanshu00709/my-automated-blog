    <h1>Does Parmesan Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Parmesan cheese, known for its rich, nutty flavor, is a staple in many kitchens around the world. Whether grated over pasta, sprinkled on salads, or enjoyed on its own, Parmesan is a versatile ingredient. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding whether Parmesan contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we will explore the gluten content in Parmesan cheese, how it is made, and what to look for when purchasing it.</p>

    <h2>What is Parmesan Cheese?</h2>

    <p>Parmesan cheese, or Parmigiano-Reggiano, is a hard, granular cheese that originated in Italy. It is made from cow's milk and aged for at least 12 months, though some varieties are aged for up to 36 months. The aging process gives Parmesan its distinctive flavor and texture. Authentic Parmigiano-Reggiano is produced in specific regions of Italy and is protected by the European Union's Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status.</p>

    <h2>Is Parmesan Cheese Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>In its purest form, Parmesan cheese is naturally gluten-free. The primary ingredients in Parmesan are milk, salt, and rennet (an enzyme used in cheese-making). None of these ingredients contain gluten. However, the gluten-free status of Parmesan can be compromised during processing or packaging. Cross-contamination can occur if the cheese is processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products. Additionally, some pre-grated Parmesan cheeses may contain additives or anti-caking agents that could introduce gluten.</p>
