                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vegetables (e.g., onions, carrots)</td>
                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
