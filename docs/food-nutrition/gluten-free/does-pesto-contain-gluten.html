    <h3>3. Non-Traditional Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Some pesto recipes or store-bought versions may include non-traditional ingredients like breadcrumbs or wheat-based thickeners, which contain gluten. Always read the ingredient list carefully.</p>

    <h2>How to Ensure Your Pesto is Gluten-Free</h2>

    <p>If you’re concerned about gluten in your pesto, here are some steps you can take to ensure it’s safe:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Make Your Own:</strong> The best way to ensure your pesto is gluten-free is to make it at home using fresh, gluten-free ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Read Labels:</strong> When buying store-bought pesto, always read the ingredient list and look for a gluten-free certification.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Trusted Brands:</strong> Opt for brands that are known for their gluten-free products and have a good reputation for quality and safety.</li>
