    <h1>Do Ice Cream Cones Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Ice cream is a beloved treat enjoyed by people of all ages. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether ice cream cones contain gluten is a crucial one. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause serious health issues for individuals with gluten-related disorders. In this article, we will explore the gluten content in ice cream cones, discuss alternatives, and provide tips for safely enjoying this frozen delight.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Presence in Ice Cream Cones</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein composite that gives dough its elasticity and helps it rise. It is commonly found in grains like wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications.</p>

    <p>Traditional ice cream cones are typically made from wheat flour, which means they contain gluten. However, the gluten content can vary depending on the type of cone and the ingredients used. Below is a table summarizing the gluten content in different types of ice cream cones:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Type of Cone</th>
                <th>Gluten Content</th>
                <th>Common Ingredients</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Regular Sugar Cone</td>
                <td>Contains Gluten</td>
                <td>Wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oil</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Waffle Cone</td>
                <td>Contains Gluten</td>
                <td>Wheat flour, sugar, butter, vanilla</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cake Cone</td>
                <td>Contains Gluten</td>
                <td>Wheat flour, sugar, eggs, milk</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Gluten-Free Cone</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
                <td>Rice flour, tapioca starch, sugar, vegetable oil</td>
            </tr>
