    <h1>Does Sweetened Condensed Milk Have Gluten?</h1>

    <p>Sweetened condensed milk is a staple in many kitchens, often used in desserts, beverages, and even savory dishes. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding whether this ingredient contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we will explore whether sweetened condensed milk contains gluten, how it is made, and what to look for when purchasing it.</p>

    <h2>What is Sweetened Condensed Milk?</h2>

    <p>Sweetened condensed milk is a thick, sweet product made by removing most of the water from cow's milk and adding sugar. The result is a dense, creamy liquid that is often used in baking and cooking. It is different from evaporated milk, which is also concentrated but does not contain added sugar.</p>

    <p>The process of making sweetened condensed milk involves heating the milk to remove about 60% of its water content, then adding sugar to preserve it. The high sugar content gives it a long shelf life, making it a popular ingredient in many recipes.</p>

    <h2>Does Sweetened Condensed Milk Contain Gluten?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is commonly found in bread, pasta, and baked goods, but it can also be present in less obvious products like sauces, soups, and even some dairy products.</p>

    <p>When it comes to sweetened condensed milk, the good news is that it is typically gluten-free. The primary ingredients in sweetened condensed milk are milk and sugar, neither of which contains gluten. However, it is essential to check the label for any additional ingredients or potential cross-contamination, especially if the product is manufactured in a facility that also processes gluten-containing foods.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients to Watch Out For</h3>

    <p>While sweetened condensed milk is generally gluten-free, some brands may add thickeners, stabilizers, or flavorings that could contain gluten. Here are some ingredients to be cautious of:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Ingredient</th>
            <th>Potential Gluten Source</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Maltodextrin</td>
            <td>Can be derived from wheat, although it is usually gluten-free.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Modified Food Starch</td>
            <td>May be derived from wheat, but it is often gluten-free.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Natural Flavors</td>
            <td>Sometimes derived from barley or other gluten-containing grains.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>If you are unsure about any of the ingredients listed on the label, it is best to contact the manufacturer directly or look for a product that is certified gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Brands of Sweetened Condensed Milk</h2>

    <p>Many brands of sweetened condensed milk are naturally gluten-free, but some are specifically labeled as such. Here are a few popular gluten-free options:</p>

        <tr>
            <th>Brand</th>
