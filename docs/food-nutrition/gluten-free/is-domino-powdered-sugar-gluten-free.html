<h1>Is Domino Powdered Sugar Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, understanding whether a product is gluten-free is crucial. One common question that arises is whether Domino powdered sugar is gluten-free. In this article, we will delve into the details of Domino powdered sugar, its ingredients, and whether it is safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

<h2>What is Domino Powdered Sugar?</h2>

<p>Domino powdered sugar, also known as confectioners' sugar or icing sugar, is a finely ground sugar mixed with a small amount of cornstarch to prevent caking. It is commonly used in baking, frosting, and dusting desserts. Domino Foods, Inc., a well-known sugar manufacturer, produces this product and markets it as a versatile ingredient for both home bakers and professional chefs.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even small amounts of gluten can cause symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. Therefore, those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity must adhere to a strict gluten-free diet.</p>

<p>Gluten-free diets have also gained popularity among people without celiac disease, often due to perceived health benefits. However, for those with gluten-related disorders, avoiding gluten is not a choice but a necessity.</p>

<h2>Is Domino Powdered Sugar Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>According to Domino Foods, Inc., their powdered sugar is gluten-free. The primary ingredients in Domino powdered sugar are sugar and cornstarch, both of which are naturally gluten-free. However, it is essential to consider the potential for cross-contamination during the manufacturing process.</p>

<p>Domino Foods states that they follow strict manufacturing practices to prevent cross-contamination with gluten-containing products. They also conduct regular testing to ensure that their products meet gluten-free standards. Therefore, Domino powdered sugar is considered safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Domino Powdered Sugar</h2>

<p>To better understand why Domino powdered sugar is gluten-free, let's take a closer look at its ingredients:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Ingredient</th>
            <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Sugar</td>
            <td>Gluten-Free</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cornstarch</td>
            <td>Gluten-Free</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>As shown in the table above, both sugar and cornstarch are naturally gluten-free. The absence of gluten-containing ingredients in Domino powdered sugar makes it a safe choice for those on a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>Potential Cross-Contamination Concerns</h2>

<p>While the ingredients in Domino powdered sugar are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. Cross-contamination happens when gluten-free products come into contact with gluten-containing products or surfaces, leading to the presence of gluten in the final product.</p>

<p>Domino Foods addresses this concern by implementing strict manufacturing protocols to prevent cross-contamination. They also conduct regular testing to ensure that their products meet gluten-free standards. However, individuals with severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease should always check the product packaging for any allergen warnings or contact the manufacturer for additional information.</p>
