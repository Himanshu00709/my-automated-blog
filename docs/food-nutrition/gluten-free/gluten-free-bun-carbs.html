    <h1>Understanding Gluten-Free Bun Carbs: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, gluten-free diets have gained significant popularity, not only among individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among those seeking healthier eating habits. One of the most common substitutes in a gluten-free diet is the gluten-free bun. However, many people are curious about the carbohydrate content in these buns and how they compare to traditional wheat-based buns. This article delves into the world of gluten-free bun carbs, providing you with a detailed understanding of their nutritional profile, benefits, and considerations.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Buns?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free buns are bread products made without gluten-containing grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. Instead, they are typically made from alternative flours like almond flour, coconut flour, rice flour, or tapioca starch. These buns are designed to mimic the texture and taste of traditional buns while being safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Carbohydrate Content in Gluten-Free Buns</h2>

    <p>Carbohydrates are a primary source of energy for the body, and they are found in varying amounts in all types of buns, including gluten-free ones. The carbohydrate content in gluten-free buns can vary significantly depending on the ingredients used. Here’s a breakdown of the typical carbohydrate content in different types of gluten-free buns:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Type of Gluten-Free Bun</th>
                <th>Carbohydrate Content (per 100g)</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Almond Flour Bun</td>
                <td>10g</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Coconut Flour Bun</td>
                <td>15g</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rice Flour Bun</td>
                <td>40g</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Tapioca Starch Bun</td>
                <td>35g</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As you can see, almond flour buns tend to have the lowest carbohydrate content, making them a popular choice for those following low-carb diets. On the other hand, rice flour buns have a higher carbohydrate content, similar to traditional wheat buns.</p>
