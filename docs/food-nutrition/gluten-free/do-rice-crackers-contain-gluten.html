    <h1>Do Rice Crackers Contain Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Rice crackers are a popular snack enjoyed by many, especially those who are health-conscious or looking for a gluten-free alternative to traditional crackers. But do rice crackers actually contain gluten? This question is particularly important for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those who follow a gluten-free diet. In this article, we will explore the ingredients of rice crackers, their potential gluten content, and what to look for when choosing a gluten-free option.</p>

    <h2>What Are Rice Crackers?</h2>

    <p>Rice crackers are a type of snack made primarily from rice, which is naturally gluten-free. They are often seasoned with various flavors such as seaweed, sesame, or soy sauce, and can be found in a variety of shapes and sizes. Rice crackers are a staple in many Asian cuisines and have gained popularity worldwide due to their light, crispy texture and versatility.</p>

    <h2>Are Rice Crackers Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>In their purest form, rice crackers are made from rice flour, water, and salt, which are all gluten-free ingredients. However, the gluten-free status of rice crackers can be compromised depending on the manufacturing process and additional ingredients used. For example, some rice crackers may contain wheat flour, barley malt, or other gluten-containing additives to enhance flavor or texture. Additionally, cross-contamination can occur during production if the crackers are made in facilities that also process gluten-containing products.</p>
