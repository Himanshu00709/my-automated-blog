<h1>Are Canned Yams Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>When it comes to managing a gluten-free diet, understanding the ingredients in your food is crucial. Canned yams are a popular staple in many households, especially during the holiday season. But are they safe for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity?

Some canned yams may contain additives, thickeners, or flavorings that could introduce gluten. It’s essential to read the label carefully to determine if the product is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>
