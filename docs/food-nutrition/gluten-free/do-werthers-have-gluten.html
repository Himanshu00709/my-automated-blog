    <h1>Do Werther's Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Werther's Original, the beloved caramel candy, has been a favorite treat for generations. Known for its rich, buttery flavor and smooth texture, it’s a go-to snack for many. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether Werther's candies contain gluten is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and gluten-free status of Werther's candies to provide you with a clear answer.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it’s essential for these individuals to carefully scrutinize the ingredients of the foods they consume.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Werther's Original Candies</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Werther's candies contain gluten, let’s first look at the ingredients list. The primary ingredients in Werther's Original candies include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Glucose syrup</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cream</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Emulsifier (lecithin)</li>
        <li>Natural and artificial flavors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it’s important to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process, which we’ll discuss in the next section.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. This happens when gluten-free products are produced in facilities that also process gluten-containing products. To assess the risk of cross-contamination with Werther's candies, we need to look at the manufacturing practices of the company.</p>

    <p>Werther's Original candies are produced by Storck, a German confectionery company. Storck has stated that they take great care to prevent cross-contamination in their facilities. However, they do not explicitly label Werther's Original candies as gluten-free. This means that while the ingredients are gluten-free, there is a slight risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

    <p>For those who require absolute certainty, gluten-free certification is a key factor. Products that are certified gluten-free have undergone rigorous testing to ensure they contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

    <p>Werther's Original candies do not carry a gluten-free certification. This lack of certification, combined with the potential for cross-contamination, means that individuals with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease should exercise caution when consuming Werther's candies.</p>

    <h2>Comparison of Werther's Products</h2>

    <p>Werther's offers a variety of products, including hard candies, chewy caramels, and sugar-free options. Below is a table comparing the gluten-free status of different Werther's products:</p>
