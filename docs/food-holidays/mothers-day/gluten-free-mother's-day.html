    <h1>Gluten-Free Mother's Day: A Guide to Celebrating with Love and Care</h1>
    <p>Mother's Day is a special occasion to honor and celebrate the incredible women in our lives. For mothers who follow a gluten-free diet, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, this day can be even more meaningful when celebrated with thoughtful, gluten-free options.

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Matters</h2>
    <p>For many individuals, gluten-free living is not just a trend but a necessity. Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, affects approximately 1% of the population. Additionally, non-celiac gluten sensitivity can cause discomfort and health issues for many others. For these individuals, consuming gluten can lead to symptoms like bloating, fatigue, and digestive distress. By embracing a gluten-free lifestyle, they can enjoy better health and well-being.</p>

    <p>Brunch is a classic Mother's Day tradition, and with a little creativity, it can be both gluten-free and delicious. Here are some ideas to inspire your menu:</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Pancakes</h3>
    <p>Start the day with fluffy gluten-free pancakes made with almond flour or a gluten-free flour blend. Top them with fresh berries, maple syrup, or a dollop of whipped cream for a decadent treat.</p>

    <h3>Quiche with a Gluten-Free Crust</h3>
    <p>A savory quiche with a gluten-free crust is a perfect centerpiece for your brunch. Use a mix of eggs, cream, and your mom’s favorite vegetables or meats to create a dish that’s both hearty and satisfying.</p>

    <h3>Fresh Fruit Salad</h3>
    <p>A colorful fruit salad is a refreshing addition to any brunch. Combine seasonal fruits like strawberries, kiwi, and pineapple for a vibrant and healthy side dish.</p>
