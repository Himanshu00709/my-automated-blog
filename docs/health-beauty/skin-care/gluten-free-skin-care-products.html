<h1>Gluten-Free Skin Care: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, not just in the food industry but also in the realm of skin care. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, avoiding gluten is crucial for maintaining overall health.
