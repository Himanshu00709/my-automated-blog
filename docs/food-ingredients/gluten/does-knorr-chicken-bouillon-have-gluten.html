<h1>Does Knorr Chicken Bouillon Have Gluten? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, understanding whether a product contains gluten is crucial. Knorr Chicken Bouillon is a popular seasoning used in many households, but its gluten content is often a topic of concern. In this article, we will explore whether Knorr Chicken Bouillon contains gluten, its ingredients, and what alternatives are available for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause severe health issues. Symptoms can range from digestive problems to skin rashes, fatigue, and even neurological issues. Therefore, it's essential for these individuals to carefully scrutinize food labels and ingredients.</p>

<h2>Knorr Chicken Bouillon: Ingredients Breakdown</h2>
