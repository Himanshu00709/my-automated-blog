    <h1>Malt Vinegar and Gluten: What You Need to Know</h1>

    <p>Malt vinegar is a popular condiment known for its distinctive flavor, often used to enhance the taste of fish and chips, salads, and other dishes. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, the question of whether malt vinegar contains gluten is a critical one. In this article, we will explore the relationship between malt vinegar and gluten, providing you with the information you need to make informed dietary choices.</p>

    <h2>What is Malt Vinegar?</h2>

    <p>Malt vinegar is made from malted barley, which is a grain that contains gluten. The process of making malt vinegar involves fermenting the barley, which converts the starches into sugars and then into alcohol. This alcohol is then further fermented to produce acetic acid, the main component of vinegar. The result is a tangy, flavorful vinegar that is commonly used in cooking and as a condiment.</p>

    <p>Given that malt vinegar is derived from barley, it inherently contains gluten. This is an important consideration for anyone who needs to avoid gluten in their diet.</p>

    <h2>Gluten Content in Malt Vinegar</h2>

    <p>The gluten content in malt vinegar can vary depending on the production process. While the fermentation process may reduce the gluten content, it does not eliminate it entirely. According to the FDA, for a product to be labeled as "gluten-free," it must contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. Malt vinegar typically contains more than this threshold, making it unsuitable for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>
