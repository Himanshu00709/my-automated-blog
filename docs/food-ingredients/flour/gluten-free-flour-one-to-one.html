    <h2>How to Use Gluten-Free Flour 1:1 in Baking</h2>

    <p>Using gluten-free flour 1:1 is straightforward, but there are a few tips to keep in mind to ensure the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Measure Accurately:</strong> Use a kitchen scale or measuring cups to ensure you're using the correct amount of flour. Too much or too little can affect the texture of your baked goods.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Thoroughly:</strong> Gluten-free flours can settle, so it's important to mix the blend well before using it to ensure an even distribution of ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Liquid Ingredients:</strong> Gluten-free flours can absorb more or less liquid than wheat flour, so you may need to adjust the amount of liquid in your recipe. Start with the original amount and add more if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Xanthan Gum:</strong> If your blend doesn't already contain xanthan gum, you may need to add it to help with the structure and elasticity of your baked goods. Typically, 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon per cup of flour is sufficient.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> Gluten-free baking can require some trial and error. Don't be afraid to experiment with different recipes and techniques to find what works best for you.</li>
    </ol>
