    <h2>How to Use Organic Gluten-Free Flour</h2>

    <p>Using organic gluten-free flour in your cooking and baking can be a bit different from using traditional wheat flour. Here are some tips to help you get started:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Blends:</strong> Different gluten-free flours have different properties, so it’s often best to use a blend of flours to achieve the desired texture and flavor. For example, a mix of almond flour and coconut flour can work well for baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Liquid Ratios:</strong> Gluten-free flours tend to absorb more liquid than wheat flour, so you may need to adjust the amount of liquid in your recipes. Start by adding a little extra liquid and adjust as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Binders:</strong> Gluten provides elasticity and structure in baked goods. When using gluten-free flours, you may need to add binders like xanthan gum or psyllium husk to achieve a similar texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Patient:</strong> Baking with gluten-free flour can take some trial and error. Don’t be discouraged if your first few attempts don’t turn out perfectly. With practice, you’ll get the hang of it.</li>
    </ul>
