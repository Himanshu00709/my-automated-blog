    <h2>What is Sir Lancelot Hi-Gluten Flour?</h2>

    <p>Sir Lancelot Hi-Gluten Flour is a high-protein flour specifically designed for bread baking. With a protein content of around 14.2%, it is one of the strongest flours available on the market. This high protein content translates to a higher gluten formation, which is essential for creating bread with a strong structure, chewy texture, and excellent oven spring.

    <p>One of the key features of Sir Lancelot Hi-Gluten Flour is its consistency. Bakers can rely on this flour to produce consistent results batch after batch, making it a trusted choice for both commercial bakeries and home bakers. Whether you’re making bagels, pizza dough, or artisan bread, Sir Lancelot Hi-Gluten Flour delivers the performance you need.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Sir Lancelot Hi-Gluten Flour?</h2>

    <p>There are several reasons why Sir Lancelot Hi-Gluten Flour is a top choice for bakers:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Superior Gluten Development:</strong> The high protein content ensures excellent gluten development, which is crucial for bread that rises well and has a chewy, satisfying texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistent Results:</strong> Bakers can count on Sir Lancelot Hi-Gluten Flour to deliver consistent results every time, making it a reliable choice for both professional and home bakers.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> This flour is incredibly versatile and can be used for a wide range of baked goods, from bagels and pizza dough to artisan bread and pretzels.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Flavor:</strong> The flour’s high protein content also contributes to a richer, more complex flavor in the finished product.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use Sir Lancelot Hi-Gluten Flour</h2>

    <p>Using Sir Lancelot Hi-Gluten Flour is straightforward, but there are a few tips to keep in mind to get the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Due to its high protein content, Sir Lancelot Hi-Gluten Flour absorbs more water than lower-protein flours. Be prepared to adjust your hydration levels accordingly. A good rule of thumb is to start with a slightly higher hydration level than you would use with all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Kneading:</strong> Proper kneading is essential to develop the gluten fully. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic, which may take a bit longer than with lower-protein flours.</li>
        <li><strong>Proofing:</strong> Allow the dough to proof adequately. The strong gluten structure will support a longer proofing time, which can enhance the flavor and texture of the bread.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking:</strong> Bake at the recommended temperature for your recipe. The high gluten content will help the bread rise beautifully in the oven, resulting in a well-structured loaf with a crisp crust.</li>
