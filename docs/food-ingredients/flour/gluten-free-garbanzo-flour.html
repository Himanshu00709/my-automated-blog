<h2>Culinary Uses of Garbanzo Flour</h2>

<p>Garbanzo flour is incredibly versatile and can be used in a variety of culinary applications. Here are some popular ways to incorporate it into your cooking:</p>

<h3>1. Baking</h3>
<p>Garbanzo flour is an excellent substitute for wheat flour in gluten-free baking. It can be used to make bread, muffins, pancakes, and even cookies. Its dense texture and nutty flavor add a unique twist to traditional baked goods. However, it’s important to note that garbanzo flour has a distinct taste, so it’s often combined with other gluten-free flours like rice flour or almond flour to balance the flavor.</p>

<h3>2. Thickening Agent</h3>
<p>Thanks to its high starch content, garbanzo flour works well as a thickening agent in soups, stews, and sauces. Simply mix it with water to create a slurry and add it to your dish for a gluten-free thickening solution.</p>

<h3>3. Batter for Frying</h3>
<p>Garbanzo flour is commonly used as a batter for frying vegetables, fish, or meat. Its ability to create a crispy coating makes it a favorite for making pakoras, falafel, and tempura. The flour’s high protein content also helps the batter adhere better to the food, resulting in a perfectly crispy texture.</p>

<h3>4. Flatbreads and Wraps</h3>
<p>In many cultures, garbanzo flour is used to make flatbreads like socca (a French flatbread) or besan chilla (an Indian pancake). These flatbreads are not only gluten-free but also high in protein, making them a nutritious alternative to traditional wheat-based wraps.</p>

<h3>3. Promotes Heart Health</h3>
