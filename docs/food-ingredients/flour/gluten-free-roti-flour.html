        <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich:</strong> Many gluten-free flours are packed with essential nutrients, including protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, contributing to overall health and well-being.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Gluten-free flours can be used in a variety of recipes, not just roti. They can be incorporated into bread, pancakes, and even desserts.</li>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Roti</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free roti is similar to making traditional roti, but with a few adjustments to accommodate the different properties of gluten-free flours. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Choose Your Flour:</strong> Select a gluten-free flour or a blend of flours that suits your taste and nutritional needs. A common blend includes chickpea flour, almond flour, and tapioca flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> Combine the flour with water, a pinch of salt, and a small amount of oil. Knead the dough until it reaches a smooth consistency. Gluten-free dough may be stickier than traditional dough, so you may need to add more flour or use a non-stick surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Roti:</strong> Divide the dough into small balls and roll them out into thin circles using a rolling pin. Dust the surface with gluten-free flour to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Roti:</strong> Heat a skillet or tawa over medium heat. Place the rolled-out roti on the skillet and cook for about 30 seconds on each side, or until bubbles form and the roti is lightly browned.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the gluten-free roti warm with your favorite curry, vegetables, or chutney.</li>
    </ol>
