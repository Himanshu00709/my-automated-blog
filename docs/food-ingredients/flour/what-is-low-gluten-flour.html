    <h1>What is Low Gluten Flour? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for alternative flours has surged, driven by dietary preferences, health concerns, and the growing awareness of gluten-related disorders. Among these alternatives, low gluten flour has emerged as a popular choice for those seeking to reduce their gluten intake without completely eliminating it. But what exactly is low gluten flour, and how does it differ from traditional wheat flour? In this article, we’ll explore the ins and outs of low gluten flour, its benefits, uses, and how it fits into a balanced diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Role in Baking</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a family of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and other grains. It is responsible for the elasticity and structure of dough, giving bread its chewy texture and helping it rise during baking. However, for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergies, consuming gluten can lead to adverse health effects. This has led to the development of gluten-free and low gluten flours as alternatives.</p>

    <p>Low gluten flour is not entirely gluten-free but contains significantly less gluten than traditional wheat flour. It is often made from grains or starches that naturally have lower gluten content, such as spelt, einkorn, or certain types of wheat that have been bred to reduce gluten levels. This makes it a suitable option for those who want to reduce their gluten intake without completely avoiding it.</p>

    <h2>Types of Low Gluten Flour</h2>

    <p>There are several types of low gluten flour available, each with its unique properties and uses. Below is a table summarizing the most common types:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Type of Flour</th>
                <th>Gluten Content</th>
                <th>Common Uses</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>

                <td>Low</td>
                <td>Baking bread, muffins, and cookies</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>Low</td>
                <td>Ancient grain recipes, pancakes, and pastries</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Kamut Flour</td>
                <td>Low to Moderate</td>
                <td>Whole grain baking, pasta, and cereals</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>White Whole Wheat Flour</td>
                <td>Moderate</td>
                <td>General baking, bread, and pizza dough</td>
            </tr>
