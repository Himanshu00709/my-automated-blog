<h1>Gluten-Free Maseca: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the general trend toward healthier eating. One product that has gained significant attention in the gluten-free community is <strong>Gluten-Free Maseca</strong>. This versatile flour has become a staple in many households, especially for those who love traditional Latin American dishes but need to avoid gluten. In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about Gluten-Free Maseca, from its origins to its nutritional benefits, and how you can incorporate it into your diet.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten-Free Maseca?</h2>

<p>Maseca is a brand of masa harina, a type of flour made from dried and ground corn that has been treated with lime (calcium hydroxide) in a process called nixtamalization.

Traditional Maseca contains gluten, but the gluten-free version is made from 100% corn, making it safe for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

<p>Gluten-Free Maseca is a game-changer for anyone who loves Mexican and Central American cuisine but needs to avoid gluten. It can be used to make a variety of dishes, including tortillas, tamales, pupusas, and more. The flour is easy to work with and produces results that are just as delicious as those made with traditional masa harina.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Maseca</h2>

<p>Gluten-Free Maseca is not only a great alternative for those avoiding gluten, but it also offers several nutritional benefits. Here’s a breakdown of its nutritional profile:</p>
