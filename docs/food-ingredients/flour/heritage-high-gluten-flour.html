    <h1>Heritage High Gluten Flour: A Baker's Secret Weapon</h1>

    <p>When it comes to baking, the type of flour you use can make or break your recipe. Among the many varieties available, <strong>Heritage High Gluten Flour</strong> stands out as a premium choice for professional bakers and home enthusiasts alike. Known for its superior protein content and exceptional gluten strength, this flour is the secret behind many artisanal breads, pizzas, and bagels. In this article, we’ll dive deep into what makes Heritage High Gluten Flour so special, its benefits, and how you can use it to elevate your baking game.</p>

    <h2>What is Heritage High Gluten Flour?</h2>

    <p>Heritage High Gluten Flour is a type of wheat flour that is milled from hard red spring wheat. It is characterized by its high protein content, typically ranging between 13.5% to 14.5%.

    <p>Unlike all-purpose flour, which is a blend of hard and soft wheat, Heritage High Gluten Flour is made exclusively from hard wheat varieties. This results in a flour that is not only high in protein but also rich in nutrients, including essential vitamins and minerals like iron and B vitamins.</p>

    <h3>1. Artisan Breads</h3>

    <p>For artisan breads like sourdough or ciabatta, Heritage High Gluten Flour is an excellent choice.

    <h3>3. Bagels</h3>

    <p>Bagels require a dough that is both strong and chewy, and Heritage High Gluten Flour delivers just that. The high protein content ensures that the bagels hold their shape during boiling and baking, resulting in a dense and chewy texture that is characteristic of traditional bagels.</p>

        <h3>1. Can I substitute Heritage High Gluten Flour for all-purpose flour?</h3>
