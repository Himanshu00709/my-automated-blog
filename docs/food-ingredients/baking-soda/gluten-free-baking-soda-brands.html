    <h1>Gluten-Free Baking Soda Brands: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Baking soda is a staple in many kitchens, used for everything from baking to cleaning. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, ensuring that even the most basic ingredients are gluten-free is crucial. While baking soda is naturally gluten-free, cross-contamination during processing can be a concern. In this article, we’ll explore the best gluten-free baking soda brands, what to look for when purchasing, and answer some common questions about gluten-free baking soda.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Baking Soda Matters</h2>

    <p>For those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, even trace amounts of gluten can cause severe health issues. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can sometimes be present in products that are not directly derived from these grains due to cross-contamination. Baking soda, while naturally gluten-free, can sometimes be processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products. Therefore, it’s essential to choose brands that are certified gluten-free to avoid any risk of contamination.</p>
