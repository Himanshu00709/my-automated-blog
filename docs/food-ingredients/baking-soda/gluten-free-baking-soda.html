    <h1>Gluten-Free Baking Soda: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Baking soda is a staple in many kitchens, known for its versatility in baking, cleaning, and even personal care. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, ensuring that every ingredient is gluten-free is crucial. This guide delves into the world of gluten-free baking soda, exploring its uses, benefits, and how to ensure you're using a product that's safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>
