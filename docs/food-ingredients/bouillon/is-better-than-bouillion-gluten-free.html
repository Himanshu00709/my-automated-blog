<h1>Is Better Than Bouillon Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>When it comes to enhancing the flavor of your dishes, Better Than Bouillon has become a staple in many kitchens. This concentrated paste offers a rich, savory taste that can elevate soups, stews, gravies, and more. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Is Better Than Bouillon gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to provide a clear answer. We’ll also explore the benefits of using Better Than Bouillon and how it compares to traditional bouillon cubes or powders.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize food labels and understand the ingredients in the products they consume.</p>

<p>Better Than Bouillon is a popular choice for many home cooks and professional chefs alike, but its gluten-free status is a common concern. Let’s break down the ingredients and manufacturing processes to determine whether this product is safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Better Than Bouillon</h2>

<p>Better Than Bouillon comes in a variety of flavors, including chicken, beef, vegetable, and more. The ingredients can vary slightly depending on the flavor, but the base ingredients typically include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Concentrated meat, poultry, or vegetables</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Hydrolyzed soy protein</li>
    <li>Yeast extract</li>
    <li>Natural flavors</li>
    <li>Spices</li>
</ul>

<p>While these ingredients are generally gluten-free, it’s important to note that some flavors may contain additional ingredients that could introduce gluten. For example, certain flavors might include maltodextrin, which can be derived from wheat. However, the company states that all their products are gluten-free unless otherwise specified on the label.</p>

<h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination</h2>

<p>Even if the ingredients in a product are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can be a concern. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free products come into contact with gluten-containing ingredients or surfaces during production. This can happen in facilities that process both gluten-free and gluten-containing products.</p>

<p>Better Than Bouillon is manufactured in facilities that also process products containing gluten. However, the company follows strict protocols to minimize the risk of cross-contamination. They conduct regular testing to ensure that their products meet gluten-free standards. According to the company, all Better Than Bouillon products are tested to contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold set by the FDA for a product to be labeled as gluten-free.</p>

<h2>Certifications and Labeling</h2>

<p>One of the most reliable ways to determine if a product is gluten-free is to look for certifications from recognized organizations. Better Than Bouillon does not currently carry a gluten-free certification from organizations like the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO). However, the company’s labeling and testing practices align with FDA guidelines for gluten-free products.</p>

<p>It’s also worth noting that some flavors of Better Than Bouillon are labeled as gluten-free on the packaging. For example, the vegetable and chicken flavors are explicitly marked as gluten-free. If you’re unsure about a particular flavor, it’s always a good idea to check the label or contact the manufacturer directly.</p>
