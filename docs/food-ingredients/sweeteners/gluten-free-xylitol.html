    <h1>Gluten-Free Xylitol: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free and low-calorie sweeteners has surged, driven by health-conscious consumers and those with dietary restrictions. Among these alternatives, xylitol has gained significant attention. But what exactly is xylitol, and why is it considered gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore the science behind xylitol, its benefits, and how it fits into a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>What is Xylitol?</h2>

    <p>Xylitol is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol found in many fruits and vegetables. It is commonly extracted from birch wood or corn cobs and is used as a sugar substitute in various food products. Unlike regular sugar, xylitol has a low glycemic index, making it a popular choice for diabetics and those looking to reduce their sugar intake. Additionally, xylitol is known for its dental benefits, as it helps prevent tooth decay by reducing the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth.</p>

    <h2>Is Xylitol Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, xylitol is gluten-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it is not present in xylitol. However, it’s essential to ensure that the xylitol you purchase is not contaminated with gluten during processing. Always look for products that are certified gluten-free to avoid any potential cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Xylitol</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free xylitol offers several health benefits, making it an excellent alternative to traditional sugar. Below are some of the key advantages:</p>
