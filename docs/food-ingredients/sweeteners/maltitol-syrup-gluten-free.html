    <h2>How Maltitol Syrup is Made</h2>

    <p>Maltitol syrup is produced through the hydrogenation of maltose, which is derived from starch. The process involves breaking down starch into maltose, which is then hydrogenated to produce maltitol. The resulting syrup is a clear, viscous liquid that is approximately 90% as sweet as sucrose (table sugar).</p>

    <p>The production process ensures that maltitol syrup remains gluten-free, as it does not involve any gluten-containing ingredients. This makes it a safe and reliable sweetener for those who need to avoid gluten in their diet.</p>

    <h2>Maltitol Syrup in Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding safe and delicious gluten-free products can be a challenge. Maltitol syrup offers a solution by providing a sweetening option that does not compromise on taste or texture. It is commonly used in gluten-free baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and muffins, to provide the same sweetness and moisture retention as sugar.</p>

    <p>Moreover, maltitol syrup is often used in gluten-free confectionery, such as chocolates and candies, to create products that are both safe and enjoyable for those on a gluten-free diet. Its ability to mimic the properties of sugar makes it an invaluable ingredient in the gluten-free food industry.</p>

    <h2>Potential Side Effects of Maltitol Syrup</h2>

    <p>While maltitol syrup offers numerous benefits, it is important to be aware of potential side effects, especially when consumed in large quantities. Some individuals may experience digestive issues, such as bloating, gas, or diarrhea, due to the body's inability to fully absorb sugar alcohols. It is recommended to consume maltitol syrup in moderation and to gradually increase intake to allow the digestive system to adjust.</p>
