    <h1>Is Corn Syrup Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Corn syrup is a common ingredient found in many processed foods, from candies to baked goods. For individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding whether corn syrup is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will explore the relationship between corn syrup and gluten, discuss its safety for gluten-sensitive individuals, and provide practical tips for navigating food labels.</p>

    <h2>What is Corn Syrup?</h2>

    <p>Corn syrup is a sweetener derived from corn starch. It is made by breaking down corn starch into glucose, which is then processed to create a thick, sweet liquid. Corn syrup is widely used in the food industry due to its ability to enhance flavor, add moisture, and prevent crystallization in products like candies and ice creams.</p>

    <p>There are two main types of corn syrup:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Light Corn Syrup:</strong> Clear and mildly sweet, often used in desserts and baked goods.</li>
        <li><strong>Dark Corn Syrup:</strong> Contains molasses, giving it a deeper color and richer flavor, commonly used in pecan pies and other rich desserts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Is Corn Syrup Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The short answer is yes, corn syrup is gluten-free. Corn itself is a gluten-free grain, and the process of converting corn starch into corn syrup does not introduce gluten. However, there are some important considerations to keep in mind:</p>
