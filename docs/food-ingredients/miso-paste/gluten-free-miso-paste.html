    <h1>Gluten-Free Miso Paste: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Miso paste, a staple in Japanese cuisine, is a fermented soybean paste that has gained global popularity for its rich umami flavor and numerous health benefits. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, traditional miso paste can be problematic due to the inclusion of barley or other gluten-containing grains. Enter gluten-free miso paste—a safe and delicious alternative that allows everyone to enjoy the benefits of this ancient condiment. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free miso paste, from its production to its culinary uses and health benefits.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Miso Paste?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free miso paste is a variation of traditional miso that is made without any gluten-containing ingredients.

In gluten-free miso, the koji is made from rice or other gluten-free grains, ensuring that the final product is safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <p>The fermentation process for gluten-free miso is similar to that of traditional miso. The soybeans and koji are mixed with salt and left to ferment for several months to several years, depending on the desired flavor profile. The result is a rich, savory paste that can be used in a variety of dishes, from soups to marinades.</p>

    <h2>Types of Gluten-Free Miso Paste</h2>

    <p>Just like traditional miso, gluten-free miso paste comes in several varieties, each with its own unique flavor and color. The most common types include:</p>

            <tr>
                <td>Yellow Miso (Shinshu Miso)</td>
