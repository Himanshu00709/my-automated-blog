<h1>Gluten-Free Bulgur Wheat: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Bulgur wheat has long been a staple in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines, prized for its nutty flavor, quick cooking time, and versatility. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, traditional bulgur wheat is off the menu due to its gluten content. Enter gluten-free bulgur wheat—a game-changer for those who need to avoid gluten but still want to enjoy the benefits of this nutritious grain. In this article, we’ll explore what gluten-free bulgur wheat is, its nutritional benefits, how to use it, and answer some common questions about this innovative product.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten-Free Bulgur Wheat?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free bulgur wheat is a specially processed version of traditional bulgur wheat that has been made safe for those who need to avoid gluten.

Gluten-free bulgur wheat, on the other hand, is typically made from gluten-free grains such as millet, quinoa, or buckwheat, which are processed in a similar way to mimic the texture and flavor of traditional bulgur.</p>

<p>This innovative product allows individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease to enjoy the same dishes that traditionally use bulgur wheat, such as tabbouleh, pilafs, and salads, without the risk of gluten exposure.</p>
