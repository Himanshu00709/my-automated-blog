<h2>What is Hodgson Mill Vital Wheat Gluten?</h2>

<p>Hodgson Mill Vital Wheat Gluten is a high-protein flour additive derived from wheat. It is essentially the natural protein found in wheat that has been isolated and dried into a powder form. This product is particularly useful for bakers who want to increase the protein content in their flour, which in turn enhances the elasticity and strength of the dough. This results in better structure, improved rise, and a chewier texture in baked goods like bread, pizza dough, and bagels.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Using Hodgson Mill Vital Wheat Gluten</h2>

<p>There are several benefits to incorporating Hodgson Mill Vital Wheat Gluten into your baking routine:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Dough Elasticity:</strong> The added gluten helps the dough stretch more easily, making it easier to shape and work with.</li>
    <li><strong>Better Rise:</strong> The increased protein content allows the dough to trap more gas during fermentation, leading to a higher rise and lighter texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Texture:</strong> Baked goods made with vital wheat gluten have a chewier, more satisfying texture, which is particularly desirable in bread and bagels.</li>
    <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> It can be added to a variety of flours, including whole wheat, rye, and spelt, to improve their baking performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use Hodgson Mill Vital Wheat Gluten</h2>

<p>Using Hodgson Mill Vital Wheat Gluten is straightforward, but it’s important to follow the recommended guidelines to achieve the best results. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Measure the Flour:</strong> Start by measuring out the amount of flour you plan to use in your recipe.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Vital Wheat Gluten:</strong> For every cup of flour, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of vital wheat gluten. The exact amount can vary depending on the recipe and the desired texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix Thoroughly:</strong> Combine the vital wheat gluten with the flour before adding any liquids. This ensures an even distribution of the gluten throughout the dough.</li>
