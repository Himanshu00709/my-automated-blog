    <h1>Kikkoman Gluten-Free Soy Sauce: Ingredients and Benefits</h1>

    <p>Kikkoman is a household name when it comes to soy sauce, known for its rich flavor and versatility in cooking. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional soy sauce can be off-limits due to its wheat content. Enter Kikkoman Gluten-Free Soy Sauce, a game-changer for those who need to avoid gluten but still want to enjoy the umami-packed flavor of soy sauce. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients of Kikkoman Gluten-Free Soy Sauce, its benefits, and why it’s a must-have in your pantry.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Kikkoman Gluten-Free Soy Sauce Different?</h2>

    <p>Traditional soy sauce is made from a combination of soybeans, wheat, salt, and water. The fermentation process breaks down the proteins in the soybeans and wheat, creating the complex flavors we associate with soy sauce. However, the presence of wheat makes traditional soy sauce unsuitable for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>

    <p>Kikkoman Gluten-Free Soy Sauce, on the other hand, is crafted without wheat. Instead, it uses rice as a substitute, making it safe for those who need to avoid gluten. Despite this substitution, Kikkoman has managed to retain the rich, savory flavor that has made their soy sauce a global favorite.</p>

    <h2>Key Ingredients in Kikkoman Gluten-Free Soy Sauce</h2>

            <tr>
                <td>Soybeans</td>
                <td>Provide the protein that is broken down during fermentation to create the umami flavor.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rice</td>
                <td>Replaces wheat in the fermentation process, making the sauce gluten-free.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>Acts as a preservative and enhances the flavor of the soy sauce.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Alcohol</td>
