    <h1>Gellan Gum: A Gluten-Free Revolution in Food Science</h1>

    <p>In the ever-evolving world of food science, gellan gum has emerged as a game-changer, especially for those seeking gluten-free alternatives. This versatile ingredient, derived from bacterial fermentation, has become a staple in the food industry due to its unique properties and wide range of applications. In this article, we will explore what gellan gum is, its benefits, and why it is a perfect choice for gluten-free diets.</p>

    <h2>What is Gellan Gum?</h2>

    <p>Gellan gum is a water-soluble polysaccharide produced by the bacterium <em>Sphingomonas elodea</em>. It was first discovered in the late 1970s and has since gained popularity as a gelling, thickening, and stabilizing agent in various food products. Unlike many other gums, gellan gum is highly efficient, requiring only small amounts to achieve the desired texture and consistency.</p>

    <p>One of the most significant advantages of gellan gum is its ability to form gels at low concentrations, making it an ideal ingredient for gluten-free products. It is also heat-stable, acid-resistant, and can be used in a wide range of pH levels, making it suitable for various culinary applications.</p>

    <h2>Why Gellan Gum is Gluten-Free</h2>

    <p>Gellan gum is naturally gluten-free, making it a safe and effective alternative for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Unlike some other thickeners and stabilizers that may contain gluten or be processed in facilities that handle gluten-containing ingredients, gellan gum is produced through a controlled fermentation process that ensures its purity.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gellan gum does not interfere with the texture or flavor of gluten-free products, which is a common challenge when formulating gluten-free foods. Its ability to mimic the elasticity and structure provided by gluten makes it an invaluable ingredient in gluten-free baking and cooking.</p>

    <h2>Applications of Gellan Gum in Gluten-Free Products</h2>

    <p>Gellan gum is widely used in the food industry, particularly in gluten-free products. Here are some of its most common applications:</p>
