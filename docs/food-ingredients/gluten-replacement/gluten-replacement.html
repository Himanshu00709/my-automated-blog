    <h1>Gluten Replacement: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, is a common ingredient in many foods. However, for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those choosing a gluten-free lifestyle, finding suitable gluten replacements is essential. This guide will explore the various gluten-free alternatives available, their nutritional benefits, and how to incorporate them into your diet.</p>
