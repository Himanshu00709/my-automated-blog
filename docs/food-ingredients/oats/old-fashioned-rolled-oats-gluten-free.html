<h1>Old Fashioned Rolled Oats: A Gluten-Free Superfood</h1>

<p>Old fashioned rolled oats have long been a staple in many households, known for their versatility, nutritional benefits, and comforting texture. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding safe and nutritious options can be challenging. Fortunately, old fashioned rolled oats can be a fantastic addition to a gluten-free lifestyle, provided they are processed in a gluten-free facility. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of old fashioned rolled oats, how they fit into a gluten-free diet, and why they are considered a superfood.</p>

<h2>What Are Old Fashioned Rolled Oats?</h2>

<p>Old fashioned rolled oats, also known as whole oat groats, are made by steaming and rolling whole oat groats into flat flakes. This process helps to preserve the nutritional integrity of the oats while making them easier to cook and digest. Unlike instant oats, which are pre-cooked and dried, rolled oats retain more of their natural texture and flavor, making them a preferred choice for many health-conscious individuals.</p>

<p>Rolled oats are rich in essential nutrients, including fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals. They are particularly high in beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber that has been shown to lower cholesterol levels, improve heart health, and support digestive health. Additionally, rolled oats are a good source of antioxidants, which help to combat oxidative stress and inflammation in the body.</p>

<h2>Are Old Fashioned Rolled Oats Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Oats are naturally gluten-free, but they are often contaminated with gluten during processing. This is because oats are frequently grown, harvested, and processed alongside gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, even trace amounts of gluten can cause adverse reactions.</p>

<p>To ensure that old fashioned rolled oats are truly gluten-free, it’s essential to choose brands that are certified gluten-free. These oats are processed in dedicated gluten-free facilities and tested to meet strict gluten-free standards. Look for labels that indicate the oats are certified gluten-free by a recognized organization, such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO).</p>
