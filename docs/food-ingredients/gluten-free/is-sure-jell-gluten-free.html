    <h1>Is Sure-Jell Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, ensuring that the foods and ingredients they consume are gluten-free is crucial. One common question that arises is whether Sure-Jell, a popular pectin product used in making jams and jellies, is gluten-free. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of Sure-Jell, its ingredients, and how it fits into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Sure-Jell?</h2>

    <p>Sure-Jell is a brand of pectin, a natural substance found in fruits that is used as a gelling agent in cooking and baking. It is commonly used to make jams, jellies, and preserves. Pectin helps these products achieve the desired consistency by thickening the fruit mixture. Sure-Jell is available in both liquid and powdered forms, and it is a staple in many kitchens for preserving fruits.</p>

    <h2>Is Sure-Jell Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, Sure-Jell is gluten-free. According to the manufacturer, Kraft Foods, Sure-Jell does not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. This makes it a safe option for individuals who need to avoid gluten due to celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it is always important to check the label for any potential cross-contamination or changes in ingredients, as formulations can vary by region or over time.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Sure-Jell</h2>

    <p>To better understand why Sure-Jell is considered gluten-free, let's take a closer look at its ingredients. The primary ingredient in Sure-Jell is pectin, which is derived from fruit. Other ingredients may include dextrose, fumaric acid, and sodium citrate, depending on the specific product. None of these ingredients contain gluten, which is why Sure-Jell is safe for those on a gluten-free diet.</p>
