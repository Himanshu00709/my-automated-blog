    <h1>Calcium Chloride: A Gluten-Free Solution for Health and Food Industry</h1>

    <p>Calcium chloride is a versatile compound that has found its way into various industries, including food production, medicine, and even sports. For individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding the role of calcium chloride in gluten-free products is crucial. This article delves into the properties of calcium chloride, its applications in gluten-free foods, and its benefits for health-conscious consumers.</p>

    <h2>What is Calcium Chloride?</h2>

    <p>Calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) is an inorganic compound composed of calcium and chlorine. It is highly soluble in water and is known for its ability to absorb moisture, making it a popular desiccant. In the food industry, calcium chloride is used as a firming agent, preservative, and electrolyte replenisher. It is also recognized as a safe food additive by regulatory bodies such as the FDA and EFSA.</p>

    <h2>Calcium Chloride in Gluten-Free Foods</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, removing gluten from food products often results in a loss of texture and structure. This is where calcium chloride comes into play. It is commonly used in gluten-free baking to improve the texture and shelf life of products. Hereâ€™s how it works:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Texture Enhancement:</strong> Calcium chloride helps bind ingredients together, providing a firmer texture to gluten-free bread, cakes, and other baked goods.</li>
        <li><strong>Moisture Retention:</strong> It prevents gluten-free products from becoming dry and crumbly by retaining moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Extended Shelf Life:</strong> By acting as a preservative, calcium chloride helps extend the shelf life of gluten-free products.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Calcium Chloride</h2>

    <p>Beyond its role in food production, calcium chloride offers several health benefits, particularly for individuals on a gluten-free diet:</p>
