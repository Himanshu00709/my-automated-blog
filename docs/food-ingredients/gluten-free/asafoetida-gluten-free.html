    <h1>Asafoetida: A Gluten-Free Spice for Health and Flavor</h1>
    <p>Asafoetida, often referred to as "hing," is a pungent spice widely used in Indian and Middle Eastern cuisines. Known for its strong aroma and unique flavor, asafoetida has been a staple in traditional cooking for centuries. But beyond its culinary uses, asafoetida is also gaining attention for its potential health benefits, particularly for those following a gluten-free diet. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free nature of asafoetida, its health benefits, and how you can incorporate it into your diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Asafoetida?</h2>
    <p>Asafoetida is a resin extracted from the roots of the Ferula plant, which is native to Iran and Afghanistan. The resin is dried and ground into a fine powder, which is then used as a spice. It has a strong, sulfurous odor when raw, but when cooked, it imparts a savory, umami-like flavor to dishes. Asafoetida is commonly used in vegetarian cooking as a substitute for garlic and onions, and it is a key ingredient in many Indian dishes, such as dal and curries.</p>

    <h2>Is Asafoetida Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Pure asafoetida is naturally gluten-free. However, some commercially available asafoetida powders may contain wheat flour or other gluten-containing additives as a filler or anti-caking agent. This is particularly common in regions where asafoetida is sold in bulk or in pre-packaged forms. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity to carefully read the ingredient labels or seek out certified gluten-free asafoetida products.</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Asafoetida Brands</h3>
    <p>To ensure that you are consuming gluten-free asafoetida, look for brands that explicitly state "gluten-free" on their packaging. Some reputable brands that offer gluten-free asafoetida include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MDH Hing (Gluten-Free Variant)</li>
        <li>Laxmi Hing (Gluten-Free Variant)</li>
        <li>Organic India Asafoetida</li>
