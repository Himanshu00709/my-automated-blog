<h1>Understanding Sesame Gluten: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Sesame gluten is a term that has gained traction in recent years, particularly among those who are health-conscious or have dietary restrictions. While gluten is commonly associated with wheat, barley, and rye, sesame gluten refers to the protein found in sesame seeds. This article delves into the intricacies of sesame gluten, its nutritional profile, potential health benefits, and how it fits into various diets.</p>

<h2>What is Sesame Gluten?</h2>

<p>Sesame gluten is the protein component found in sesame seeds.

This makes it a unique protein source, especially for those who are gluten-intolerant or have celiac disease.</p>

<p>Sesame seeds are rich in protein, healthy fats, and essential nutrients, making them a valuable addition to any diet. The protein in sesame seeds is composed of various amino acids, some of which are essential for human health. The term "sesame gluten" is often used to describe the protein fraction that can be isolated from sesame seeds, which can then be used in various food products.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Profile of Sesame Gluten</h2>

<p>Sesame gluten is not only a source of protein but also contains a range of other nutrients that contribute to overall health. Below is a table summarizing the nutritional content of sesame gluten per 100 grams:</p>
