    <h1>Is Great Value Cornstarch Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and the general preference for gluten-free diets. One common kitchen staple that often comes under scrutiny is cornstarch. Specifically, many people wonder whether Great Value Cornstarch, a popular brand available at Walmart, is gluten-free. In this article, we will delve into the details, examining the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential cross-contamination risks to determine whether Great Value Cornstarch is safe for those following a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Cornstarch?</h2>

    <p>Cornstarch is a fine, powdery substance derived from the endosperm of corn kernels. It is commonly used as a thickening agent in cooking and baking, helping to create smooth sauces, gravies, and desserts. Cornstarch is naturally gluten-free, as it is made from corn, which does not contain gluten. However, the gluten-free status of cornstarch can be compromised during processing or packaging if it comes into contact with gluten-containing products.</p>

    <h2>Great Value Cornstarch: Ingredients and Gluten-Free Status</h2>

    <p>Great Value Cornstarch is a product of Walmart's private label brand, known for offering affordable and high-quality products. The primary ingredient in Great Value Cornstarch is, of course, cornstarch. According to the product label and information provided by Walmart, Great Value Cornstarch is gluten-free. This means that it does not contain any gluten-containing ingredients and is safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <p>However, it is important to note that while the product itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing or packaging. To ensure the safety of their gluten-free products, many manufacturers follow strict protocols to prevent cross-contamination. Walmart has not explicitly stated whether their Great Value Cornstarch is produced in a dedicated gluten-free facility, so individuals with severe gluten intolerance should exercise caution and consider reaching out to the manufacturer for more detailed information.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Cross-contamination occurs when a gluten-free product comes into contact with gluten-containing products or surfaces. This can happen during the manufacturing process, packaging, or even in the home kitchen. For individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, even trace amounts of gluten can cause adverse reactions.</p>

    <p>To minimize the risk of cross-contamination, many manufacturers implement strict cleaning protocols and use dedicated equipment for gluten-free products. Some even have separate facilities entirely dedicated to gluten-free production. While Great Value Cornstarch is labeled as gluten-free, it is always a good idea to check the packaging for any disclaimers about shared facilities or equipment.</p>
