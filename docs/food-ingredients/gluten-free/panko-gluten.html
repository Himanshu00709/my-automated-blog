<h1>Understanding Panko Gluten: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Panko breadcrumbs have become a staple in many kitchens around the world, known for their light, airy texture and ability to create a crispy coating on fried foods. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether panko contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we will delve into the world of panko gluten, exploring what it is, how it differs from regular breadcrumbs, and what options are available for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

<h2>What is Panko?</h2>

<p>Panko is a type of breadcrumb that originated in Japan. Unlike traditional breadcrumbs, which are made from finely ground bread, panko is made from bread that is baked using an electric current, resulting in a lighter, flakier texture. This unique texture is what gives panko its signature crunch when used as a coating for fried foods. Panko is commonly used in dishes like tempura, tonkatsu, and as a topping for casseroles.</p>

<h2>Does Panko Contain Gluten?</h2>

<p>The primary ingredient in traditional panko breadcrumbs is wheat flour, which contains gluten. Therefore, standard panko is not suitable for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivities. However, the growing demand for gluten-free products has led to the development of gluten-free panko options. These are typically made from gluten-free grains such as rice, corn, or quinoa, and are processed in facilities that avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing products.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Panko Options</h2>

<p>For those who need to avoid gluten, there are several gluten-free panko options available on the market. These products are designed to mimic the texture and crunch of traditional panko while being safe for those with gluten sensitivities. Below is a table comparing some popular gluten-free panko brands:</p>
