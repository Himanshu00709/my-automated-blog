    <h1>Durum Wheat: Is It Gluten-Free?</h1>
    <p>Durum wheat is a staple in many diets around the world, particularly in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisines. Known for its high protein content and golden color, durum wheat is commonly used to make pasta, couscous, and bread. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and other health concerns, many people are questioning whether durum wheat is gluten-free. In this article, we will explore the nature of durum wheat, its gluten content, and whether it can be part of a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Durum Wheat?</h2>
    <p>Durum wheat (Triticum durum) is a type of hard wheat that is primarily grown in the Mediterranean region, North America, and parts of Asia. It is known for its high protein content, which makes it ideal for producing pasta and semolina flour. Durum wheat is distinct from other types of wheat, such as common wheat (Triticum aestivum), due to its harder texture and higher gluten content.</p>

    <h2>Is Durum Wheat Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>No, durum wheat is not gluten-free. Like all wheat varieties, durum wheat contains gluten, a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. Gluten is responsible for the elasticity and chewiness of dough, making it essential for baking and pasta-making. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and autoimmune reactions.</p>

    <h2>Gluten Content in Durum Wheat</h2>
    <p>Durum wheat has a higher gluten content compared to other wheat varieties. This high gluten content is what gives durum wheat its unique properties, such as its ability to hold shape during cooking and its firm texture. Below is a table comparing the gluten content of durum wheat with other common wheat varieties:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Wheat Variety</th>
                <th>Gluten Content (%)</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Durum Wheat</td>
                <td>12-14%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Common Wheat (Triticum aestivum)</td>
                <td>10-12%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Spelt Wheat</td>
                <td>9-11%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Einkorn Wheat</td>
                <td>7-9%</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
