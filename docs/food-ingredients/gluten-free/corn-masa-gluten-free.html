<h1>Corn Masa: A Gluten-Free Staple for Healthy Living</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the desire for healthier dietary choices. Among the many gluten-free alternatives available, corn masa stands out as a versatile and nutritious option. This traditional ingredient, deeply rooted in Latin American cuisine, has gained global recognition for its unique properties and health benefits. In this article, we will explore the world of corn masa, its gluten-free nature, nutritional value, and how it can be incorporated into a balanced diet.</p>

<h2>What is Corn Masa?</h2>

<p>Corn masa, also known as masa harina, is a type of flour made from dried corn kernels that have been treated with an alkaline solution, a process known as nixtamalization. This process not only enhances the nutritional profile of the corn but also gives masa its distinctive flavor and texture. Masa is the foundation of many traditional dishes, including tortillas, tamales, and pupusas. Its gluten-free nature makes it an excellent choice for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

<h2>Why is Corn Masa Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Since corn masa is made from corn, which is naturally gluten-free, it does not contain any gluten. However, it is essential to ensure that the masa is processed in a gluten-free facility to avoid cross-contamination. Many brands now offer certified gluten-free masa harina, making it a safe option for those on a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits of Corn Masa</h2>

<p>Corn masa is not only gluten-free but also packed with essential nutrients. Here are some of the key nutritional benefits:</p>
