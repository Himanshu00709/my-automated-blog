    <h1>Tapioca Pearls: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

    <p>In recent years, tapioca pearls have gained immense popularity, especially among those who follow a gluten-free diet. These small, chewy spheres are not only a staple in bubble tea but also a versatile ingredient in various culinary applications. But what exactly are tapioca pearls, and why are they considered a gluten-free option? In this article, we’ll delve into the world of tapioca pearls, exploring their origins, nutritional benefits, and how they fit into a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>What Are Tapioca Pearls?</h2>

    <p>Tapioca pearls, also known as boba, are small, chewy balls made from tapioca starch, which is extracted from the cassava root. Cassava is a tropical plant native to South America, and its starchy roots have been a dietary staple for centuries. The process of making tapioca pearls involves extracting the starch from the cassava root, forming it into small spheres, and then cooking them until they achieve their characteristic chewy texture.</p>

    <p>Traditionally, tapioca pearls are used in desserts and beverages, most notably in bubble tea, where they add a unique texture and visual appeal. However, their versatility extends beyond beverages; they can also be used in puddings, soups, and even as a thickening agent in various dishes.</p>

    <h2>Why Are Tapioca Pearls Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>One of the key reasons tapioca pearls are celebrated in the gluten-free community is that they are naturally free from gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Since tapioca pearls are made from cassava starch, which is inherently gluten-free, they are a safe and delicious option for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <p>It’s important to note, however, that while tapioca pearls themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during processing or packaging. Therefore, it’s crucial to look for tapioca pearls that are certified gluten-free if you have celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity. Always check the packaging for any gluten-free certifications or labels to ensure the product meets your dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Tapioca Pearls</h2>

    <p>While tapioca pearls are primarily known for their texture and culinary uses, they also offer some nutritional benefits. Here’s a breakdown of the key nutrients found in tapioca pearls:</p>
