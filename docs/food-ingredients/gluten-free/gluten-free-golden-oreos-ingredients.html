    <h2>How Do Gluten-Free Golden Oreos Compare to Regular Golden Oreos?</h2>

    <p>While Gluten-Free Golden Oreos aim to replicate the taste and texture of the original, there are some differences worth noting. The primary distinction lies in the flour used. Regular Golden Oreos contain wheat flour, which is a source of gluten. In contrast, Gluten-Free Golden Oreos use rice flour and tapioca starch as the main ingredients. This substitution ensures that the cookies are safe for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>

    <p>Despite the change in ingredients, Gluten-Free Golden Oreos manage to retain the iconic crunch and creamy filling that Oreo lovers adore. The flavor profile is remarkably similar, making it a satisfying alternative for those who cannot consume gluten.</p>

    <h2>Are Gluten-Free Golden Oreos Safe for Everyone?</h2>

    <p>While Gluten-Free Golden Oreos are designed for individuals who need to avoid gluten, it’s important to note that they may not be suitable for everyone. For example, those with severe allergies to other ingredients, such as soy or dairy, should check the label carefully. Additionally, while the cookies are gluten-free, they are still processed in facilities that handle gluten-containing products, which could pose a risk for individuals with extreme sensitivities.</p>

    <p>It’s always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or dietitian if you have specific dietary concerns or restrictions.</p>
