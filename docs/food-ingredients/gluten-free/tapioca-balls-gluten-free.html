<h1>Tapioca Balls: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten intolerance. Among the many gluten-free options available, tapioca balls have emerged as a popular choice, especially in the realm of beverages like bubble tea. But what exactly are tapioca balls, and why are they considered a gluten-free delight? This article delves into the world of tapioca balls, exploring their origins, nutritional benefits, and why they are a safe and delicious option for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>What Are Tapioca Balls?</h2>

<p>Tapioca balls, also known as boba or pearls, are small, chewy spheres made from tapioca starch, which is derived from the cassava root. These balls are a staple ingredient in bubble tea, a Taiwanese drink that has gained global popularity. Tapioca balls are typically black or white, although they can be found in a variety of colors and flavors. Their unique texture and ability to absorb flavors make them a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savory dishes.</p>

<h2>Why Are Tapioca Balls Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Tapioca balls are naturally gluten-free because they are made from tapioca starch, which is extracted from the cassava plant. Cassava is a root vegetable that does not contain gluten, making it a safe option for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Unlike wheat, barley, or rye, which contain gluten proteins, cassava is free from these proteins, ensuring that tapioca balls are a gluten-free product.</p>

<p>However, it's important to note that while tapioca balls themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during processing or preparation. Therefore, it's crucial to check the packaging for gluten-free certification or to inquire about the preparation methods if you're consuming tapioca balls at a restaurant or café.</p>
