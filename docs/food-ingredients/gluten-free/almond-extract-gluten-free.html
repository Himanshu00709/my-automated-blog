    <h1>Almond Extract: A Gluten-Free Flavor Powerhouse</h1>
    <p>Almond extract is a versatile and flavorful ingredient that has become a staple in many kitchens. Whether you're baking cookies, crafting cocktails, or enhancing the flavor of your morning oatmeal, almond extract adds a rich, nutty essence that elevates any dish. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether almond extract is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we'll dive deep into the world of almond extract, exploring its gluten-free status, benefits, and how to incorporate it into your gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>What is Almond Extract?</h2>
    <p>Almond extract is a concentrated liquid made from bitter almonds or almond oil. It is typically produced by soaking almonds in alcohol, which extracts the essential oils and flavors. The result is a potent liquid that packs a punch of almond flavor, even in small quantities. Almond extract is commonly used in baking, confectionery, and beverages to impart a distinct almond taste.</p>

    <h2>Is Almond Extract Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Yes, pure almond extract is naturally gluten-free. The primary ingredients in almond extract are almonds and alcohol, both of which do not contain gluten. However, it's essential to read the label carefully, as some brands may add additional ingredients or use processing methods that could introduce gluten. Always look for products that are certified gluten-free to ensure they meet the strict standards for gluten-free labeling.</p>
