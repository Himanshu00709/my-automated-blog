    <h1>Gluten-Free Poppy Seeds: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Poppy seeds have been a staple in culinary traditions around the world for centuries. Known for their nutty flavor and crunchy texture, these tiny seeds are often used in baking, cooking, and even as a garnish. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether poppy seeds are gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will delve into the world of gluten-free poppy seeds, exploring their nutritional benefits, potential risks, and how to incorporate them into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Poppy Seeds?</h2>

    <p>Poppy seeds are derived from the opium poppy plant, scientifically known as <em>Papaver somniferum</em>.

Therefore, individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity should always look for poppy seeds that are certified gluten-free to ensure they are safe to consume.</p>
