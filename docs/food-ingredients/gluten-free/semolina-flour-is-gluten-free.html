    <h1>Is Semolina Flour Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Semolina flour is a staple in many kitchens, especially for those who enjoy making pasta, bread, or desserts. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding whether semolina flour is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will explore the nature of semolina flour, its gluten content, and alternatives for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Semolina Flour?</h2>

    <p>Semolina flour is a coarse, pale-yellow flour made from durum wheat. It is commonly used in making pasta, couscous, and certain types of bread. The high gluten content in semolina gives it a unique elasticity, making it ideal for pasta that needs to hold its shape during cooking. However, this also means that semolina flour is not suitable for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Is Semolina Flour Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>No, semolina flour is not gluten-free. Since it is derived from durum wheat, it contains gluten, a protein that can cause adverse reactions in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Gluten is responsible for the elasticity and chewiness in baked goods, which is why semolina flour is often used in pasta and bread recipes.</p>

    <h3>Gluten Content in Semolina Flour</h3>

    <p>The gluten content in semolina flour is relatively high compared to other types of flour. This is because durum wheat, the source of semolina, has a higher protein content than other wheat varieties. The table below provides a comparison of gluten content in different types of flour:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Type of Flour</th>

            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Semolina Flour</td>
                <td>High</td>
            </tr>

                <td>All-Purpose Flour</td>
                <td>Moderate</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Whole Wheat Flour</td>
                <td>Moderate to High</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Almond Flour</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>

                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
