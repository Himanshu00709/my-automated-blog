    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Pizza Crust at Home</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free pizza crust at home is easier than you might think, especially when using a pre-made mix. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create a delicious gluten-free pizza crust:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Gather Your Ingredients:</strong> In addition to the gluten-free pizza crust mix, you’ll need water, olive oil, and any additional toppings you want to add to your pizza.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> Follow the instructions on the package to mix the dough. Typically, you’ll need to combine the mix with water and olive oil, then knead the dough until it’s smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Dough Rest:</strong> Allow the dough to rest for a few minutes. This helps the ingredients fully hydrate and makes the dough easier to work with.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Crust:</strong> Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) to your desired thickness. You can also press the dough into a pizza pan or baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Bake the Crust:</strong> Pre-baking the crust for a few minutes before adding toppings helps prevent a soggy crust. Bake at the temperature recommended on the package for about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Toppings and Bake:</strong> Once the crust is pre-baked, add your favorite toppings and bake the pizza until the crust is golden brown and the toppings are cooked through.</li>
    </ol>
