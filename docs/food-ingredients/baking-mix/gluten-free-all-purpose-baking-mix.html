<h1>Gluten-Free All-Purpose Baking Mix: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the growing popularity of gluten-free diets.

It typically includes a combination of rice flour, potato starch, tapioca flour, and xanthan gum, which helps to replicate the elasticity and structure that gluten provides in traditional baking. This mix can be used as a direct substitute for regular flour in a wide range of recipes, from cakes and cookies to bread and pizza dough.</p>
