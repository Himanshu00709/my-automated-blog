    <h1>Gluten-Free Liquid Smoke: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Liquid smoke is a popular ingredient used to impart a smoky flavor to a variety of dishes without the need for traditional smoking methods.

This article delves into the world of gluten-free liquid smoke, exploring its production, uses, benefits, and how to ensure it fits into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Liquid Smoke?</h2>

    <p>Liquid smoke is a concentrated flavoring made by capturing and condensing the smoke from burning wood.
