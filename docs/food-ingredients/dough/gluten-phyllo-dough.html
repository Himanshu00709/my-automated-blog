<h1>Gluten-Free Phyllo Dough: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Phyllo dough, known for its delicate, paper-thin layers, is a staple in many cuisines, particularly in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern dishes. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, traditional phyllo dough is off the table. Enter gluten-free phyllo dough—a game-changer for those who want to enjoy their favorite pastries without the gluten. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free phyllo dough, from its ingredients and preparation to its uses and benefits.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten-Free Phyllo Dough?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free phyllo dough is a variation of traditional phyllo dough that eliminates gluten-containing ingredients like wheat flour. Instead, it uses a blend of gluten-free flours such as rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch to achieve a similar texture and functionality. The result is a dough that can be rolled out into thin sheets, layered, and baked to create flaky, crispy pastries that are safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Gluten-Free Phyllo Dough</h2>

<p>The key to successful gluten-free phyllo dough lies in the choice of ingredients. Here’s a breakdown of the common components:</p>

<table>
