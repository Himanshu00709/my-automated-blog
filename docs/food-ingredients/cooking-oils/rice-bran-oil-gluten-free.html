    <h1>Rice Bran Oil: A Gluten-Free Superfood</h1>
    <p>In recent years, rice bran oil has gained significant attention as a healthy cooking oil alternative. Extracted from the outer layer of rice grains, this oil is not only rich in essential nutrients but also naturally gluten-free. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, rice bran oil offers a safe and nutritious option for cooking and baking. In this article, we will explore the benefits of rice bran oil, its gluten-free properties, and how it can be incorporated into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Rice Bran Oil?</h2>
    <p>Rice bran oil is derived from the outer layer of rice grains, known as the bran. This layer is removed during the milling process to produce white rice.

Therefore, rice bran oil is safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. However, it is essential to ensure that the oil is processed in a facility that does not handle gluten-containing products to avoid cross-contamination.</p>
