<h1>Bran Oil: A Gluten-Free Superfood for Health Enthusiasts</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of gluten intolerance and celiac disease. Among the many gluten-free options available, bran oil has emerged as a nutritional powerhouse. Extracted from the outer layer of grains like rice, wheat, or oats, bran oil is not only gluten-free but also packed with essential nutrients that can benefit your overall health. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of bran oil, its gluten-free properties, and how you can incorporate it into your diet.</p>

<h2>What is Bran Oil?</h2>

<p>Bran oil is derived from the bran, the outer layer of cereal grains such as rice, wheat, or oats. This layer is rich in nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

<p>One of the most common questions about bran oil is whether it is gluten-free. The answer depends on the source of the bran. For example, rice bran oil is naturally gluten-free, making it a safe option for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, wheat bran oil may contain gluten unless it is specifically processed to remove gluten proteins. Always check the label to ensure the product is certified gluten-free if you have a gluten-related disorder.</p>
