    <h1>Gluten Substitutes for Bread: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, is a key ingredient in traditional bread-making. It provides the elasticity and structure that give bread its chewy texture. However, for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those choosing a gluten-free lifestyle, finding suitable substitutes for gluten in bread is essential. This article explores various gluten substitutes, their benefits, and how they can be used to create delicious, gluten-free bread.</p>

Gluten substitutes are necessary to mimic the properties of gluten, ensuring that gluten-free bread is not only safe to eat but also enjoyable. These substitutes can be derived from a variety of sources, including grains, seeds, and even certain types of flour.</p>
