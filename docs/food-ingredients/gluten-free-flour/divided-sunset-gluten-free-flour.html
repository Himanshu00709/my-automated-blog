        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Bread</td>
                <td>Add a bit more liquid than usual, as gluten-free flours tend to absorb more moisture. Consider using xanthan gum or psyllium husk to improve elasticity.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Cookies</td>
                <td>Chill the dough before baking to prevent spreading. Gluten-free flours can sometimes result in thinner cookies if the dough is too warm.</td>
