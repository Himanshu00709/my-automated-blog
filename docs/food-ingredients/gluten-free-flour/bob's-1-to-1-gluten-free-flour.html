            <tr>
                <td>Cakes and Cupcakes</td>
                <td>For light and fluffy cakes, make sure to cream your butter and sugar thoroughly before adding the flour. This helps to incorporate air into the batter, resulting in a tender crumb.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Cookies</td>
                <td>When making cookies, chill the dough for at least 30 minutes before baking. This helps to prevent spreading and ensures that your cookies hold their shape.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Bread</td>
                <td>Gluten-free bread can be a bit denser than traditional bread. To improve the texture, consider adding an extra egg or a bit of yogurt to the dough for added moisture and structure.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pizza Dough</td>
                <td>When making pizza dough, let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes before rolling it out. This allows the xanthan gum to fully hydrate, resulting in a more elastic dough that's easier to work with.</td>
