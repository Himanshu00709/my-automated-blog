    <h2>Health Benefits of Yellow Corn Flour</h2>
    <p>Yellow corn flour offers a range of health benefits, making it a valuable addition to a gluten-free diet. Here are some of the key benefits:</p>

    <h3>4. Provides Sustained Energy</h3>
    <p>Yellow corn flour is a good source of complex carbohydrates, which are digested slowly and provide a steady release of energy. This makes it an excellent choice for maintaining energy levels throughout the day, especially for athletes or those with active lifestyles.</p>
