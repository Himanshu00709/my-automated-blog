<h2>How to Use Kim's Gluten-Free Bread Flour</h2>

<p>Using Kim's Gluten-Free Bread Flour is straightforward, but there are a few tips and tricks to ensure the best results. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Measure Accurately:</strong> Use a kitchen scale to measure the flour by weight for the most accurate results. If you don’t have a scale, spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with a knife.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix Thoroughly:</strong> When combining the flour with other dry ingredients, make sure to mix them thoroughly to ensure an even distribution of the xanthan gum and other binders.</li>
    <li><strong>Hydrate Properly:</strong> Gluten-free flours often require more liquid than wheat flour. Be sure to follow the recipe instructions carefully, and don’t be afraid to add a bit more liquid if the dough seems too dry.</li>
    <li><strong>Knead Gently:</strong> Unlike traditional bread dough, gluten-free dough doesn’t need to be kneaded extensively. A gentle mix or a few turns in a stand mixer should be sufficient.</li>
    <li><strong>Allow to Rest:</strong> Letting the dough rest for a few minutes before baking allows the flours and starches to fully hydrate, resulting in a better texture.</li>
