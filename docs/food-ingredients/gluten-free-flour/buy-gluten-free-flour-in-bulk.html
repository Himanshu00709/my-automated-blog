    <h2>How to Store Gluten-Free Flour in Bulk</h2>

    <p>Proper storage is crucial when buying gluten-free flour in bulk to maintain its freshness and prevent spoilage. Here are some tips to ensure your flour stays in optimal condition:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Airtight Containers:</strong> Store your flour in airtight containers to protect it from moisture, pests, and odors. Glass or plastic containers with tight-fitting lids are ideal.</li>
