    <h2>How to Use Jovial Gluten-Free Flour</h2>

    <p>Jovial Gluten-Free Flour is incredibly versatile and can be used in a wide range of recipes. Here are some tips on how to incorporate it into your cooking and baking:</p>

    <h3>Baking</h3>

    <p>When baking with Jovial Gluten-Free Flour, it is important to note that it behaves differently from wheat flour. Gluten-free flours lack the elasticity and structure provided by gluten, so you may need to add binders such as xanthan gum or guar gum to achieve the desired texture. A general rule of thumb is to use 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of xanthan gum per cup of flour for cakes and cookies, and 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons for bread.</p>

    <h3>Thickening Agent</h3>

    <p>Jovial Gluten-Free Flour can also be used as a thickening agent for soups, sauces, and gravies. To use it as a thickener, mix the flour with a small amount of cold liquid to form a slurry, then gradually whisk it into the hot liquid. This will help prevent lumps and ensure a smooth, consistent texture.</p>

    <h3>Coating and Breading</h3>

    <p>For a gluten-free alternative to traditional breading, Jovial Gluten-Free Flour can be used to coat meats, fish, and vegetables before frying or baking. Its fine texture helps create a crispy, golden crust that is both delicious and gluten-free.</p>
