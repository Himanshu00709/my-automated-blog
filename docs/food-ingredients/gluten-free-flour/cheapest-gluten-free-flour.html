    <h2>How to Use Gluten-Free Flours</h2>
    <p>Using gluten-free flours can be a bit different from using traditional wheat flour. Here are some tips to help you get the best results:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blend Flours:</strong> Combining different gluten-free flours can help achieve a better texture and flavor. For example, mixing rice flour with tapioca flour can improve the elasticity of baked goods.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Binders:</strong> Gluten-free flours often lack the binding properties of gluten. Adding xanthan gum or psyllium husk can help improve the structure of your baked goods.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Liquid Ratios:</strong> Gluten-free flours can absorb more or less liquid than wheat flour. You may need to adjust the amount of liquid in your recipes accordingly.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> Don't be afraid to experiment with different flours and recipes. Each flour has its unique properties, and finding the right combination can take some trial and error.</li>
    </ul>
