    <h1>Asafoetida Powder: A Gluten-Free Superfood</h1>
    <p>Asafoetida, also known as "hing," is a resinous gum derived from the roots of the Ferula plant. It has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and culinary practices, particularly in Indian cuisine. Known for its pungent aroma and unique flavor, asafoetida is a staple in many kitchens. But beyond its culinary uses, asafoetida powder is gaining attention for its potential health benefits, especially for those following a gluten-free diet. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free nature of asafoetida powder, its health benefits, and how you can incorporate it into your diet.</p>
