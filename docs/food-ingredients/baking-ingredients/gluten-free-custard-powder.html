    <h1>Gluten-Free Custard Powder: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by an increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders and a growing preference for healthier dietary choices. Among the many gluten-free alternatives available, gluten-free custard powder has emerged as a popular option for those who love the creamy, comforting texture of custard but need to avoid gluten.

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Custard Powder?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free custard powder is a specially formulated version of traditional custard powder that excludes gluten-containing ingredients.

In gluten-free custard powder, wheat flour is replaced with gluten-free alternatives such as cornstarch, rice flour, or tapioca starch. This substitution ensures that individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those following a gluten-free diet can enjoy custard without adverse health effects.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Custard Powder</h2>

    <p>Switching to gluten-free custard powder offers several benefits, particularly for those with gluten-related health concerns. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>
