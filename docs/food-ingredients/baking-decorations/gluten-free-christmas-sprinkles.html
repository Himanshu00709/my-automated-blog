    <h1>Gluten-Free Christmas Sprinkles: A Festive Guide</h1>
    <p>Christmas is a time of joy, celebration, and, of course, delicious treats. For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding festive ingredients that are safe to consume can be a challenge. One such ingredient is Christmas sprinkles, a staple for decorating cookies, cakes, and other holiday desserts. In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free Christmas sprinkles, from what they are to how to use them, and even how to make your own at home.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Christmas Sprinkles?</h2>
