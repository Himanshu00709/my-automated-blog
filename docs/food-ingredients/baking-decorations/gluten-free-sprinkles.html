    <h1>Gluten-Free Sprinkles: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>When it comes to baking and decorating, sprinkles are a must-have ingredient. They add color, texture, and a touch of whimsy to cakes, cookies, and other desserts. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding gluten-free sprinkles can be a challenge. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free sprinkles, from what they are to how to use them in your baking.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Sprinkles?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free sprinkles are decorative confections made without any gluten-containing ingredients. Traditional sprinkles often contain wheat starch or other gluten-based additives, which can be problematic for those with gluten intolerance. Gluten-free sprinkles, on the other hand, are made with alternative ingredients such as rice flour, cornstarch, or tapioca starch, ensuring they are safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Sprinkles?</h2>

    <p>Choosing gluten-free sprinkles is essential for anyone who needs to avoid gluten in their diet. Consuming even small amounts of gluten can cause severe reactions in individuals with celiac disease, including digestive issues, fatigue, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Additionally, gluten-free sprinkles are often made with natural colors and flavors, making them a healthier option for everyone, not just those with gluten sensitivities.</p>
