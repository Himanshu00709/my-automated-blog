<h1>Gluten-Free Communion Cups: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Communion is a sacred ritual in many Christian traditions, symbolizing the body and blood of Jesus Christ. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, participating in communion can be challenging due to the presence of gluten in traditional communion wafers. Gluten-free communion cups have emerged as a solution, allowing everyone to partake in this holy sacrament without compromising their health. This article delves into the importance, benefits, and options available for gluten-free communion cups.</p>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause severe health issues. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Symptoms can range from digestive problems to fatigue, skin rashes, and even neurological issues. Gluten sensitivity, while not as severe, can still cause discomfort and health problems.</p>

<p>Given the potential health risks, it's crucial for individuals with these conditions to avoid gluten entirely. This includes the small amount of gluten found in traditional communion wafers. Gluten-free communion cups provide a safe alternative, ensuring that everyone can participate in the sacrament without fear of adverse health effects.</p>
