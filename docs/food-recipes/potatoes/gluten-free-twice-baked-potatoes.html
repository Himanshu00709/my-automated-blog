    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Bake the Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Wash the potatoes thoroughly and pat them dry. Poke a few holes in each potato with a fork to allow steam to escape during baking. Rub the potatoes with olive oil and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Place the potatoes directly on the oven rack and bake for about 45-60 minutes, or until they are tender when pierced with a fork.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>Once the potatoes are baked, let them cool for a few minutes until they are safe to handle. Cut each potato in half lengthwise and carefully scoop out the insides, leaving a thin layer of potato around the skin to maintain the shape. Place the scooped-out potato in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter, sour cream, shredded cheese, green onions, bacon, garlic powder, and paprika to the bowl. Mix everything together until well combined and creamy.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Fill and Bake Again</h3>
    <p>Spoon the potato mixture back into the potato skins, dividing it evenly among them. Sprinkle a little extra cheese on top if desired. Place the filled potato halves on a baking sheet and bake in the oven for another 15-20 minutes, or until the tops are golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Twice Baked Potatoes</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free twice baked potatoes are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. Potatoes are a great source of vitamins C and B6, potassium, and fiber. When combined with other healthy ingredients like olive oil, cheese, and green onions, this dish becomes a well-rounded meal that provides essential nutrients for your body. Additionally, by using gluten-free ingredients, you can enjoy this dish without any of the negative effects associated with gluten consumption.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Twice Baked Potatoes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Potatoes:</strong> Russet potatoes are ideal for twice baked potatoes because of their starchy texture, which makes them fluffy and light when baked.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Labels:</strong> Always double-check the labels of your ingredients to ensure they are gluten-free. Some cheeses, sour creams, and bacon may contain hidden gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Extra Toppings:</strong> Feel free to customize your twice baked potatoes with additional toppings like chives, jalapeños, or even a dollop of Greek yogurt for extra creaminess.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> You can prepare the potatoes up to the second baking step and refrigerate them for up to 24 hours before baking. This makes them a convenient option for meal prep or entertaining.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Can I make twice baked potatoes ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the potatoes up to the second baking step and refrigerate them for up to 24 hours. When you’re ready to serve, simply bake them in the oven until heated through and the cheese is melted.</p>

        <h3>Are all cheeses gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Most natural cheeses are gluten-free, but it’s always important to check the label, especially for processed cheeses or cheese blends that may contain additives with gluten.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze twice baked potatoes?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze twice baked potatoes. After the first baking and filling step, wrap the potatoes tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, then freeze. When ready to eat, bake them directly from frozen, adding a few extra minutes to the cooking time.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of sour cream?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use sour cream, you can substitute it with Greek yogurt or a dairy-free alternative like coconut yogurt for a similar creamy texture.</p>
