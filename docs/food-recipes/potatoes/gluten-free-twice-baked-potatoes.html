    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Bake the Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Wash the potatoes thoroughly and pat them dry. Pierce each potato several times with a fork to allow steam to escape during baking. Place the potatoes directly on the oven rack and bake for about 45-60 minutes, or until they are tender when pierced with a fork.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>Once the potatoes are baked, let them cool for a few minutes until they are safe to handle. Cut each potato in half lengthwise and carefully scoop out the insides, leaving a thin layer of potato flesh attached to the skin to maintain the structure. Place the scooped-out potato flesh in a large mixing bowl.</p>

    <h3>3. Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add the butter, sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, milk, salt, and pepper to the bowl with the potato flesh. Mash and mix everything together until smooth and creamy. If you like, you can also add chopped chives or green onions and cooked bacon bits for extra flavor.</p>

    <h3>4. Fill the Potato Skins</h3>
    <p>Spoon the mashed potato mixture back into the potato skins, dividing it evenly among them. You can mound the filling slightly for a more generous portion. Sprinkle additional shredded cheese on top if desired.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake Again</h3>
    <p>Place the filled potato halves on a baking sheet and return them to the oven. Bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Twice Baked Potatoes</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free twice baked potatoes are not only delicious but also offer several nutritional benefits. Potatoes are a good source of vitamins C and B6, potassium, and fiber. When prepared with healthy ingredients like low-fat sour cream and minimal butter, they can be a nutritious addition to your diet. Additionally, using dairy-free alternatives can make this dish suitable for those who are lactose intolerant.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze twice baked potatoes?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! After filling the potato skins, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, then freeze. When you’re ready to enjoy them, bake them directly from the freezer, adding a few extra minutes to the baking time.</p>
