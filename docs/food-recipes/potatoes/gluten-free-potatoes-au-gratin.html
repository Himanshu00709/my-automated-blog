<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Follow these steps to create a delicious gluten-free potatoes au gratin:</p>

<h3>1. Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure that your dish cooks evenly and develops a golden-brown crust.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Potatoes</h3>
<p>Peel the potatoes and slice them thinly, about 1/8 inch thick. You can use a mandoline slicer for even slices, which will help the potatoes cook uniformly.</p>

<h3>3. Make the Cream Sauce</h3>
<p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant. Stir in the gluten-free flour to create a roux, then gradually whisk in the heavy cream. Cook the mixture until it thickens slightly, then season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<h3>4. Layer the Potatoes and Sauce</h3>
<p>In a greased baking dish, layer the sliced potatoes and pour the cream sauce over each layer. Sprinkle shredded cheese between the layers and on top. If desired, add a layer of gluten-free breadcrumbs for a crispy topping.</p>

<h3>5. Bake</h3>
<p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly, and the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.</p>

<h3>6. Let it Rest</h3>
<p>Allow the potatoes au gratin to rest for about 10 minutes before serving. This will help the dish set and make it easier to slice.</p>
