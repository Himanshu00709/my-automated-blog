    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). While the oven is heating, peel and thinly slice the potatoes. Aim for uniform slices to ensure even cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Cream Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant. Stir in the gluten-free flour and cook for another minute to create a roux. Gradually whisk in the heavy cream, ensuring there are no lumps. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, then reduce the heat and stir in half of the shredded cheese. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Layer the Potatoes</h3>
    <p>In a greased baking dish, layer the potato slices evenly. Pour the cream sauce over the potatoes, making sure to coat each layer. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the dish to cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or chives if desired. Pair with a fresh salad or roasted vegetables for a complete meal.</p>
