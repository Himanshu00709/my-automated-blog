<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your dish bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown crust.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Potatoes</h3>
<p>Peel the potatoes and slice them thinly, about 1/8-inch thick. You can use a mandoline slicer for even slices, which helps the potatoes cook uniformly. Rinse the slices in cold water to remove excess starch, then pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Make the Gluten-Free Sauce</h3>
<p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant. Stir in the gluten-free flour blend to create a roux. Gradually whisk in the heavy cream, ensuring there are no lumps. Cook the mixture until it thickens slightly, then add the salt, pepper, and nutmeg (if using). Remove from heat and stir in 1 cup of the shredded cheddar cheese until melted and smooth.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Assemble the Dish</h3>
<p>In a greased baking dish, layer half of the potato slices evenly. Pour half of the cheese sauce over the potatoes, spreading it out to cover the slices. Repeat with the remaining potatoes and sauce. Sprinkle the remaining cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese on top.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly, and the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Let It Rest</h3>
<p>Allow the dish to rest for about 10 minutes before serving. This helps the sauce set and makes it easier to slice and serve.</p>

<h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Au Gratin Potatoes</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Choose the Right Potatoes:</strong> Yukon Gold or Russet potatoes work best for this recipe due to their starch content, which helps create a creamy texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Freshly Grated Cheese:</strong> Pre-shredded cheese often contains anti-caking agents that can affect the texture of your sauce. Freshly grated cheese melts more smoothly.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Roux:</strong> The gluten-free flour blend acts as a thickener for the sauce, ensuring it clings to the potatoes and doesn’t become watery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! While cheddar and Parmesan are classic choices, you can experiment with other cheeses like Gruyère, Gouda, or even a blend of your favorites.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can assemble the dish up to a day in advance and refrigerate it. When ready to bake, let it come to room temperature before placing it in the oven. You may need to add a few extra minutes to the baking time.</p>

    <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegetarians?</h3>
    <p>Yes, this recipe is vegetarian-friendly. Just ensure that the cheese you use is made with vegetarian rennet if that’s a concern.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free au gratin potatoes?</h3>
    <p>While you can freeze this dish, the texture of the potatoes may change slightly upon reheating. For best results, consume it fresh or refrigerate leftovers for up to 3 days.</p>
</div>
