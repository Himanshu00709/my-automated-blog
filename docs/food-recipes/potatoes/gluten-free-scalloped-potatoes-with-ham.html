<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter or cooking spray. Thinly slice the Yukon Gold potatoes using a mandoline or sharp knife for even cooking.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Gluten-Free Sauce</h3>
<p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the gluten-free flour and whisk continuously for about 1-2 minutes to create a roux. Gradually pour in the milk and heavy cream, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Add the minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook the sauce until it thickens, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese until melted and smooth.</p>

<h3>3. Layer the Potatoes and Ham</h3>
<p>Arrange a layer of sliced potatoes in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle a portion of the diced ham over the potatoes, then pour a portion of the cheese sauce evenly over the top. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of sauce on top.</p>

<h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese over the top layer. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and the top is golden and bubbly.</p>

<h3>5. Garnish and Serve</h3>
<p>Let the dish cool for 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh thyme if desired. Serve warm and enjoy!</p>

<p>This gluten-free scalloped potatoes with ham dish is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. Potatoes are a great source of vitamin C, potassium, and fiber, while ham provides high-quality protein and essential amino acids.
