    <p>Making gluten-free sourdough discard biscuits is a straightforward process that requires just a few simple ingredients. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create these delicious biscuits at home:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup gluten-free sourdough discard</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups gluten-free flour blend (e.g., almond flour, coconut flour, or a mix)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cold unsalted butter or coconut oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk or non-dairy alternative (e.g., almond milk, oat milk)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut in the Butter:</strong> Add the cold butter or coconut oil to the dry ingredients and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut it into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Sourdough Discard:</strong> Stir in the gluten-free sourdough discard until the dough comes together. If the dough is too dry, add a little milk or non-dairy alternative until it reaches the desired consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Biscuits:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a few times. Roll the dough out to about 1/2-inch thickness and use a biscuit cutter to cut out the biscuits.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Allow the biscuits to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy them warm with butter, jam, or your favorite spread.</li>
    </ol>
