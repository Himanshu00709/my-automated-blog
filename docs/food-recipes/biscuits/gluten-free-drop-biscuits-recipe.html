<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 450°F (230°C). This high temperature is essential for achieving that perfect golden-brown crust on your biscuits.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure they are evenly distributed.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cut in the Butter</h3>
<p>Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. This step is crucial for creating flaky layers in your biscuits.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add the Milk</h3>
<p>Pour the milk (or non-dairy alternative) into the bowl and gently stir until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough biscuits. If you prefer a slightly sweeter biscuit, you can add a tablespoon of honey or sugar at this stage.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Drop the Biscuits</h3>
<p>Using a spoon or an ice cream scoop, drop portions of the dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Space them about 2 inches apart to allow for spreading during baking.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
<p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown on top. Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Drop Biscuits</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Cold Butter:</strong> Cold butter is key to achieving flaky layers in your biscuits. If the butter melts before baking, the biscuits will be dense rather than light and airy.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough biscuits. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add herbs, cheese, or other flavorings to customize your biscuits to your taste.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. Almond flour, coconut flour, and oat flour are popular alternatives, but they may require adjustments to the liquid content.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these biscuits ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. When you’re ready to bake, simply drop the dough onto a baking sheet and bake as directed.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftover biscuits?</h3>
    <p>Store leftover biscuits in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the biscuits and reheat them in the oven when needed.</p>
