    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This ensures your biscuits won’t stick and will bake evenly.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure the ingredients are well combined to avoid uneven baking.</p>

    <h3>3. Incorporate Butter</h3>
    <p>Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. This step is crucial for achieving flaky biscuits.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Buttermilk</h3>
    <p>Pour the buttermilk into the bowl and gently stir until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the biscuits tough. If desired, add a tablespoon of honey or sugar for a hint of sweetness.</p>

    <h3>5. Drop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop portions of the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Space them about 2 inches apart to allow for spreading. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown on top.</p>

    <h3>6. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the biscuits to cool slightly before serving. They’re best enjoyed warm, with a pat of butter or your favorite jam.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Biscuits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Ingredients:</strong> Cold butter and buttermilk help create a flaky texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense biscuits. Mix just until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add herbs, cheese, or spices to customize your biscuits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute regular flour if you don’t need a gluten-free option. However, the texture and rise may differ slightly.</p>

        <h3>What if I don’t have buttermilk?</h3>
        <p>You can make a buttermilk substitute by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to 1 cup of milk. Let it sit for 5 minutes before using.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover biscuits?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover biscuits in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, freeze them and reheat in the oven when ready to eat.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these biscuits dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use dairy-free butter and a plant-based buttermilk substitute (e.g., almond milk with lemon juice).</p>
