    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Vegan Gluten-Free Drop Biscuits</h2>

    <p>Now that you're familiar with the key ingredients, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious biscuits:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Flax Egg</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of flaxseed meal with 3 tablespoons of water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it thickens. This will act as a binding agent in place of eggs.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of almond flour, 1 cup of gluten-free flour blend, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure even distribution.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add 1/4 cup of melted coconut oil, the prepared flax egg, and 1/2 cup of non-dairy milk to the dry ingredients. Stir until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense biscuits.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Drop the Biscuits</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or an ice cream scoop, drop portions of the dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Space them about 2 inches apart to allow for spreading.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Bake the biscuits for 12-15 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. Let them cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Vegan Gluten-Free Drop Biscuits</h2>

    <p>To ensure your biscuits turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough biscuits. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Ingredients:</strong> For flakier biscuits, use cold coconut oil and non-dairy milk. This helps create layers in the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add herbs, garlic, or nutritional yeast for a savory twist, or mix in some cinnamon and sugar for a sweet version.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Store leftover biscuits in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or freeze them for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Vegan Gluten-Free Drop Biscuits</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours like oat flour, rice flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose blend. Keep in mind that the texture may vary slightly depending on the flour you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these biscuits oil-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can replace the coconut oil with unsweetened applesauce or mashed banana for an oil-free version. The texture will be slightly different, but they will still be delicious.</p>

        <h3>How do I make the biscuits fluffier?</h3>
        <p>To achieve fluffier biscuits, make sure your baking powder is fresh and active. Additionally, avoid overmixing the dough, as this can deflate the air bubbles that help the biscuits rise.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the dough?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the dough for up to 3 months. Simply portion the dough onto a baking sheet, freeze until solid, then transfer to a freezer bag. When ready to bake, add a few extra minutes to the baking time.</p>
