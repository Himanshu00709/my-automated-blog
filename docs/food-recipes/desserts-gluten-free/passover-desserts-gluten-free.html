<h1>Gluten-Free Passover Desserts: A Delicious Guide</h1>

<p>Passover is a time of reflection, tradition, and, of course, delicious food. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding desserts that adhere to both Passover dietary laws and gluten-free requirements can be a challenge. However, with a little creativity and the right ingredients, you can create mouthwatering gluten-free Passover desserts that everyone will love. In this guide, we’ll explore some of the best gluten-free dessert options for Passover, along with tips and recipes to make your holiday celebration even sweeter.</p>

<h2>Why Gluten-Free Desserts for Passover?</h2>

<p>Passover dietary laws, or <em>kashrut</em>, prohibit the consumption of leavened bread and other products made with wheat, barley, rye, oats, and spelt. This means that traditional flour-based desserts are off the table. For those who also follow a gluten-free diet, this restriction aligns well with their dietary needs. However, it’s important to ensure that all ingredients used in Passover desserts are certified kosher for Passover and free from gluten contamination.</p>
