    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your casserole will cook evenly and develop a golden-brown crust on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Cut the chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces. Season them with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat and cook the chicken until it’s no longer pink, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, whisk together the gluten-free cream of chicken soup, chicken broth, and gluten-free flour. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens slightly, about 3-4 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked chicken, frozen mixed vegetables, and the sauce you just prepared. Stir everything together until well combined. Transfer the mixture to a greased 9x13 inch baking dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Topping</h3>
    <p>Sprinkle the shredded cheddar cheese evenly over the top of the casserole. Then, sprinkle the gluten-free breadcrumbs over the cheese. This will create a delicious, crunchy topping as the casserole bakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the casserole is bubbly and the top is golden brown. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Chicken Casserole</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Ingredients:</strong> Since this recipe relies on simple ingredients, using high-quality chicken, fresh vegetables, and a good gluten-free cream of chicken soup will make a big difference in flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize the Vegetables:</strong> Feel free to swap out the frozen mixed vegetables for your favorite fresh or frozen veggies. Broccoli, carrots, and peas are all great options.</li>
        <li><strong>Make It Ahead:</strong> This casserole can be assembled a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator until you’re ready to bake it. Just add a few extra minutes to the baking time if it’s going into the oven cold.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>Can I use fresh vegetables instead of frozen?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can absolutely use fresh vegetables. Just make sure to chop them into bite-sized pieces and cook them slightly before adding them to the casserole to ensure they’re tender after baking.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this recipe dairy-free by using a dairy-free cream of chicken soup and substituting the cheddar cheese with a dairy-free alternative. Be sure to check that all ingredients are labeled gluten-free and dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave until heated through.</p>
