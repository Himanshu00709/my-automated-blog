    <h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Marinade?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.

A gluten-free marinade can also enhance the natural flavors of the flank steak without overpowering it.</p>

        <li><strong>Acidic Component:</strong> Lemon juice, lime juice, or apple cider vinegar help tenderize the meat and add a tangy flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Olive oil, avocado oil, or sesame oil provide moisture and help the marinade adhere to the steak.</li>
        <li><strong>Herbs and Spices:</strong> Fresh or dried herbs like rosemary, thyme, and oregano, along with spices like garlic powder, paprika, and black pepper, add depth and complexity.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweetener:</strong> Honey, maple syrup, or brown sugar can balance the acidity and add a touch of sweetness.</li>
