<h2>Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Marinade</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, minced garlic, brown sugar, smoked paprika, black pepper, and salt. Whisk the ingredients together until the sugar dissolves completely. This marinade will infuse the beef brisket with deep, savory flavors.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Marinate the Beef Brisket</h3>
<p>Place the beef brisket in a large resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the brisket, ensuring it is evenly coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. The longer the brisket marinates, the more flavorful it will be.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Sear the Brisket</h3>
<p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Remove the brisket from the marinade (reserve the marinade) and sear it on all sides until browned. This step locks in the juices and adds a delicious crust to the brisket.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Slow Cook the Brisket</h3>
<p>Transfer the seared brisket to a slow cooker or a large oven-safe pot. Add the sliced onions and reserved marinade. Pour in the gluten-free beef broth to keep the brisket moist during cooking. Cover and cook on low heat for 8-10 hours in a slow cooker, or bake in the oven at 300°F (150°C) for 4-5 hours. The low and slow cooking process ensures the brisket becomes tender and falls apart easily.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Rest and Slice</h3>
<p>Once the brisket is cooked, remove it from the slow cooker or oven and let it rest for 15-20 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring a moist and flavorful result. Slice the brisket against the grain and serve with the cooking juices and onions.</p>

<h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
<p>This gluten-free beef brisket pairs wonderfully with a variety of side dishes. Consider serving it with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mashed potatoes or cauliflower mash</li>
    <li>Steamed green beans or roasted vegetables</li>
    <li>Gluten-free cornbread or dinner rolls</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Beef Brisket</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different cut of beef for this recipe?</h3>
    <p>While beef brisket is ideal for slow cooking due to its marbling and connective tissue, you can use other cuts like chuck roast or short ribs. However, the cooking time may vary.</p>

    <h3>2. How do I know if my soy sauce is gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Look for soy sauce labeled "gluten-free" on the packaging. Traditional soy sauce contains wheat, but gluten-free versions are made with alternative grains like rice.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make this recipe in an Instant Pot?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Sear the brisket using the sauté function, then cook on high pressure for 60-75 minutes. Allow for a natural pressure release for the best results.</p>

    <h3>4. How should I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store leftover brisket in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in the oven or microwave to maintain its tenderness.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This gluten-free beef brisket recipe is a testament to the fact that dietary restrictions don’t have to mean sacrificing flavor. With a few simple substitutions and a little patience, you can create a dish that’s both delicious and inclusive. Whether you’re hosting a dinner party or simply craving a comforting meal, this brisket is sure to impress. So, roll up your sleeves, gather your ingredients, and get ready to enjoy a gluten-free culinary masterpiece!</p>
