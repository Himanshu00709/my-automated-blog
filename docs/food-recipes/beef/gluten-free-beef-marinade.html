    <h1>Gluten-Free Beef Marinade: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

        <li><strong>Olive Oil:</strong> Olive oil helps to tenderize the beef and acts as a carrier for the other flavors in the marinade.</li>

        <li><strong>Garlic and Onion:</strong> These aromatics are essential for building a flavorful base.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Marinating Beef</h2>

    <p>Marinating beef is a simple process, but there are a few tips that can help you get the best results:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Non-Reactive Container:</strong> Always marinate beef in a glass, ceramic, or plastic container. Metal containers can react with the acidic ingredients in the marinade and affect the flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Over-Marinate:</strong> While marinating beef for several hours or overnight can enhance the flavor, over-marinating can make the meat mushy. For most cuts, 2-4 hours is sufficient.</li>
        <li><strong>Pat Dry Before Cooking:</strong> Before cooking, pat the beef dry with paper towels. This will help to achieve a better sear and prevent steaming.</li>
        <li><strong>Reserve Some Marinade:</strong> If you want to use the marinade as a sauce, set aside a portion before adding it to the beef. Never reuse marinade that has come into contact with raw meat.</li>
    </ul>
