    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free pineapple casserole is straightforward and requires just a few simple steps. Follow these instructions to create a dish that will impress your family and friends:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lightly grease a 9x9 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Pineapple Mixture:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the drained pineapple chunks, sugar, reserved pineapple juice, and gluten-free flour. Stir until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Cheese:</strong> Fold in the shredded cheddar cheese until evenly distributed throughout the mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Transfer to Baking Dish:</strong> Pour the pineapple mixture into the prepared baking dish, spreading it out evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Topping:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the crushed gluten-free crackers with the melted butter. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the top of the pineapple mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the casserole is bubbly.</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Pineapple Casserole</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free pineapple casserole turns out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Gluten-Free Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. For this recipe, a 1:1 gluten-free flour blend works best, as it mimics the texture and consistency of regular flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Cheese:</strong> The cheese is a key component of this dish, so opt for a high-quality sharp cheddar for the best flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> When combining the ingredients, be gentle to avoid breaking down the pineapple chunks too much. You want to maintain some texture in the casserole.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch the Topping:</strong> Keep an eye on the cracker topping as it bakes. You want it to be golden brown, but not burnt. If it starts to brown too quickly, you can cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
    </ul>
