    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Broccoli</h3>
    <p>Start by steaming or blanching the broccoli florets until they are tender but still crisp. This ensures that the broccoli retains its vibrant green color and nutrients. Drain the broccoli well and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Cheese Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the gluten-free flour and whisk continuously to create a roux. Gradually pour in the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Cook the mixture until it thickens, then stir in the shredded cheddar cheese until it’s fully melted and the sauce is smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the steamed broccoli and cheese sauce, ensuring the broccoli is evenly coated. Transfer the mixture to a greased casserole dish. If desired, sprinkle gluten-free breadcrumbs on top for a crunchy texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake and Serve</h3>
    <p>Bake the casserole in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving. This dish pairs wonderfully with a fresh salad or roasted vegetables for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Broccoli Cheese Casserole</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free broccoli cheese casserole is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. Broccoli is a rich source of vitamins C and K, fiber, and antioxidants, while cheese provides calcium and protein. By using gluten-free ingredients, you’re also making this dish accessible to those with dietary restrictions, ensuring everyone can enjoy it without worry.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen broccoli for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, frozen broccoli works just as well as fresh. Just make sure to thaw and drain it thoroughly before using to avoid excess moisture in the casserole.</p>
