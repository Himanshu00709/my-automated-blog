    <h1>Gluten-Free Chile Relleno Casserole: A Delicious and Healthy Twist</h1>
    <p>Chile Relleno is a classic Mexican dish that traditionally consists of roasted poblano peppers stuffed with cheese, dipped in an egg batter, and fried to golden perfection.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Poblano Peppers</h3>
    <p>Start by roasting the poblano peppers. You can do this by placing them directly over a gas flame or under a broiler until the skin is charred and blistered. Once roasted, place the peppers in a bowl and cover them with plastic wrap to steam for about 10 minutes. This will make it easier to peel off the skin. After peeling, make a small slit in each pepper and remove the seeds, being careful not to tear the pepper.</p>

    <h3>2. Stuff the Peppers</h3>
    <p>Stuff each poblano pepper with a generous amount of shredded cheese. You can use cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a blend of your favorite cheeses. Once stuffed, arrange the peppers in a single layer in a greased baking dish.</p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Egg Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, gluten-free flour, baking powder, salt, and black pepper until well combined. This mixture will act as the "batter" for your casserole, giving it a light and fluffy texture.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Pour the egg mixture evenly over the stuffed peppers in the baking dish. Make sure the peppers are well-coated. Sprinkle any remaining cheese on top for an extra cheesy finish.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the casserole for about 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the center is set. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>This Gluten-Free Chile Relleno Casserole is incredibly versatile and can be served in a variety of ways. Here are a few ideas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>As a Main Dish:</strong> Serve it with a side of Mexican rice and a fresh salad for a complete meal.</li>
        <li><strong>As a Side Dish:</strong> Pair it with grilled chicken or steak for a hearty dinner.</li>
        <li><strong>With Toppings:</strong> Add a dollop of sour cream, a sprinkle of fresh cilantro, or a drizzle of hot sauce for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this casserole ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the casserole up to a day in advance. Simply cover it tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate. When you’re ready to bake, let it come to room temperature before placing it in the oven.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While cheddar and Monterey Jack are popular choices, you can experiment with other cheeses like pepper jack, queso fresco, or even a vegan cheese alternative.</p>

        <h3>Is this casserole spicy?</h3>
        <p>The spiciness of the casserole depends on the poblano peppers you use. Poblanos are generally mild, but if you prefer a spicier dish, you can add a diced jalapeño to the egg mixture or use a spicier cheese.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this casserole?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this casserole freezes well. After baking, let it cool completely, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. To reheat, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and bake at 350°F (175°C) until heated through.</p>
