    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter or cooking spray. If using fresh broccoli, steam or blanch the florets until they’re tender but still crisp. If using frozen broccoli, thaw and drain it well to remove excess moisture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, and milk. Stir until the mixture is smooth and well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Add the broccoli florets to the sauce and gently toss to coat them evenly. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish, spreading it out into an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese over the top.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Topping</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix the gluten-free breadcrumbs with the melted butter. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the top of the casserole. This will create a deliciously crunchy topping as it bakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake and Serve</h3>
    <p>Place the casserole in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling. Let it cool for 5 minutes before serving. Enjoy this comforting dish as a main course or a side!</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of This Dish</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free broccoli casserole is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. Broccoli is an excellent source of vitamins C and K, which support immune function and bone health. The cheese adds calcium and protein, while the gluten-free breadcrumbs provide a satisfying crunch without the gluten. By using gluten-free ingredients, this recipe is safe for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, making it a great option for inclusive meals.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>

        <p>Absolutely! Cooked chicken, turkey, or even tofu can be added to make this dish more filling and protein-rich.</p>
