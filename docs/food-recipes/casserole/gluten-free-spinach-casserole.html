    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a casserole dish with olive oil or a non-stick cooking spray.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Spinach</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant. Add the chopped spinach and cook until wilted, approximately 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the beaten eggs, milk, and gluten-free breadcrumbs. Stir in the sautéed spinach and mix well. If using cheese, fold it into the mixture at this stage. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Pour the mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle additional gluten-free breadcrumbs or cheese on top for a crispy crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the casserole is set.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the casserole to cool for 5-10 minutes before serving. Pair it with a fresh salad or roasted vegetables for a complete meal.</p>
