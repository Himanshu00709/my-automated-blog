    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prep</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). While the oven is heating, cook the bacon in a skillet until crispy. Once cooked, drain on paper towels and crumble into small pieces. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. In the same skillet used for the bacon, add olive oil and cook the chicken over medium heat until fully cooked (about 6-7 minutes per side). Once cooked, shred the chicken using two forks.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the shredded chicken, crumbled bacon, gluten-free cream of chicken soup, sour cream, and half of the shredded cheddar cheese. Stir until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Transfer the mixture to a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle the remaining cheddar cheese on top, followed by the gluten-free breadcrumbs. This will create a deliciously crispy topping.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake and Serve</h3>
    <p>Bake the casserole in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbly. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh parsley or green onions if desired.</p>
