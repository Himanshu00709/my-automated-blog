    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making this delicious casserole:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure that your casserole bakes evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the broccoli:</strong> Steam or blanch the broccoli florets until they are tender but still crisp. This will help them retain their texture during baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the cheese sauce:</strong> In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the gluten-free flour and whisk until smooth. Gradually add the milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until it thickens. Stir in the shredded cheddar cheese until melted and smooth. Season with salt, pepper, and any additional seasonings you prefer.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the broccoli and cheese sauce:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the steamed broccoli with the cheese sauce. Mix well to ensure that all the broccoli is coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Transfer to a baking dish:</strong> Pour the broccoli and cheese mixture into a greased baking dish. Sprinkle the gluten-free breadcrumbs evenly over the top.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the casserole in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the casserole is bubbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and enjoy:</strong> Allow the casserole to cool for a few minutes before serving. This dish pairs well with a fresh salad or a side of roasted vegetables.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Customizing Your Casserole</h2>
    <p>One of the best things about this gluten-free broccoli and cheese casserole is its versatility. Here are a few tips for customizing the dish to suit your tastes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Add protein:</strong> For a heartier meal, consider adding cooked chicken, turkey, or even tofu to the casserole.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with cheeses:</strong> While cheddar is a classic choice, you can also try using other cheeses like mozzarella, gouda, or even a blend of cheeses for a unique flavor profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate other vegetables:</strong> Feel free to add other vegetables like cauliflower, carrots, or bell peppers to the mix for added nutrition and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Make it dairy-free:</strong> If you’re avoiding dairy, you can substitute the milk and cheese with dairy-free alternatives like almond milk and vegan cheese.</li>
    </ul>
