    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your casserole will cook evenly and develop a delicious golden crust on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Pasta</h3>
    <p>Cook the gluten-free pasta according to the package instructions until it's al dente. Drain and set aside. Overcooking the pasta can make it mushy in the casserole, so be sure to keep an eye on it.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Brown the Ground Beef</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, sautéing until fragrant. Add the ground beef and cook until browned, breaking it up into small pieces as it cooks. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta, browned ground beef, gluten-free tomato sauce, and diced tomatoes. Mix well to ensure all ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Assemble the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Transfer the mixture to a greased casserole dish. Sprinkle the shredded cheese evenly over the top. If desired, add a layer of gluten-free breadcrumbs for an extra crunch.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the casserole in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the top is golden brown. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>
