    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making your gluten-free hashbrown casserole:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This will ensure that your casserole bakes evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the frozen hashbrowns, gluten-free cream of chicken soup, sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, melted butter, and finely chopped onion. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the mixture:</strong> Add salt and pepper to taste. Be sure to mix thoroughly so that the seasoning is evenly distributed throughout the casserole.</li>
        <li><strong>Transfer to a baking dish:</strong> Pour the mixture into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread it out evenly with a spatula.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the topping (optional):</strong> If you’re using gluten-free breadcrumbs, sprinkle them evenly over the top of the casserole. This will give your casserole a nice, crispy topping.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the casserole is bubbling around the edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it rest:</strong> Once the casserole is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before serving. This will allow the flavors to meld together and make it easier to cut into portions.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Customizing Your Gluten-Free Hashbrown Casserole</h2>
    <p>One of the best things about a hashbrown casserole is how versatile it is. Here are a few ideas for customizing your gluten-free hashbrown casserole to suit your taste:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Add vegetables:</strong> Consider adding some diced bell peppers, spinach, or broccoli to the mix for an extra boost of nutrients.</li>
        <li><strong>Spice it up:</strong> If you like a bit of heat, add some diced jalapeños or a dash of hot sauce to the mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Change the cheese:</strong> While cheddar is a classic choice, you can experiment with other cheeses like mozzarella, pepper jack, or even a blend of cheeses.</li>
        <li><strong>Make it vegan:</strong> For a vegan version, substitute the sour cream with a dairy-free alternative, use vegan cheese, and replace the cream of chicken soup with a vegan cream soup.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Hashbrown Casserole</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this casserole ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the casserole up to a day in advance. Simply assemble the ingredients in the baking dish, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate.

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free hashbrown casserole?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This casserole freezes well. After baking, let it cool completely, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before placing it in the freezer. To reheat, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and then bake at 350°F until heated through.</p>
