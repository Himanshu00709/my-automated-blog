    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free squash casserole is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a dish that will impress your family and friends:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Squash</h3>
    <p>Start by washing and slicing the yellow squash and zucchini. If you’re using fresh squash, you can leave the skin on for added texture and nutrients. If you prefer a smoother casserole, you can peel the squash before slicing.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until it becomes translucent. Next, add the sliced squash and zucchini to the skillet. Cook the vegetables until they are tender but still firm, about 5-7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the sautéed vegetables, gluten-free breadcrumbs, shredded cheese, eggs, and milk. Stir the mixture until all the ingredients are well combined. The eggs and milk will act as a binder, helping to hold the casserole together.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Transfer the mixture to a greased casserole dish and spread it evenly. Sprinkle a little extra cheese on top if desired. Bake the casserole for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the casserole is set.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the casserole to cool for a few minutes before serving. This dish pairs well with a fresh salad or a side of roasted vegetables. It’s perfect for a family dinner or a potluck gathering.</p>
