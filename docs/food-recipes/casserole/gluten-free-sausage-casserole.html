    <h2>Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the cooking process. Follow these steps to create a mouthwatering gluten-free sausage casserole:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure that your casserole cooks evenly and achieves a golden-brown crust on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Sausages</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the gluten-free sausages and cook until they are browned on all sides. Remove the sausages from the skillet and set them aside. Once they have cooled slightly, slice them into bite-sized pieces.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the diced onion, minced garlic, and chopped bell peppers. Sauté until the vegetables are softened and fragrant, about 5-7 minutes. This step builds the flavor base for your casserole.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced sausages, sautéed vegetables, gluten-free breadcrumbs, chicken broth, heavy cream, and shredded cheese. Mix everything together until well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Transfer the mixture to a greased casserole dish. Spread it out evenly and sprinkle additional gluten-free breadcrumbs on top for a crispy crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the casserole is bubbly and the top is golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Remove the casserole from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. This dish pairs wonderfully with a fresh green salad or steamed vegetables for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Sausage Casserole</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this casserole ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the casserole up to a day in advance. Simply assemble the ingredients in the casserole dish, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. When you’re ready to bake, remove the plastic wrap and place the dish in the preheated oven. You may need to add a few extra minutes to the baking time if the casserole is cold from the fridge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While sausages are the star of this dish, you can substitute them with other gluten-free meats such as ground turkey, chicken, or even plant-based sausages. Just make sure that any meat or meat substitute you use is certified gluten-free.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free breadcrumbs on hand, you can use crushed gluten-free crackers, almond flour, or even rolled oats (ensure they are certified gluten-free). These alternatives will provide a similar texture and help bind the casserole together.</p>
    </div>
