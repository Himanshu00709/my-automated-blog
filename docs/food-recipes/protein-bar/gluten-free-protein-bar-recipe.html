    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free protein bars:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> Measure out all the ingredients and ensure that they are gluten-free. This is especially important for the oats and protein powder.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free oats, protein powder, chia seeds, and sea salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the almond butter, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract until smooth. Then, pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until everything is well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the Chocolate Chips:</strong> Gently fold in the dark chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Press into a Pan:</strong> Line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper. Transfer the mixture into the pan and press it down firmly using a spatula or your hands to create an even layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill:</strong> Place the pan in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to allow the bars to set. Once set, remove from the fridge and cut into bars or squares.</li>
        <li><strong>Store:</strong> Store the bars in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week, or freeze for longer storage.</li>
