    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Start by pounding the chicken breasts to an even thickness. This ensures that they cook evenly and remain tender. Season both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper, then dredge them in gluten-free flour, shaking off any excess.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Marsala Sauce</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they are softened and browned, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute. Pour in the Marsala wine and chicken broth, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Allow the sauce to simmer and reduce by half, about 10 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine and Serve</h3>
    <p>Return the chicken to the skillet, spooning the sauce over the top. Let the chicken simmer in the sauce for a few minutes to absorb the flavors. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve hot. This dish pairs beautifully with gluten-free pasta, mashed potatoes, or steamed vegetables.</p>
