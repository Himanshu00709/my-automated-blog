<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
<p>Start by preparing all your ingredients. Slice the carrots and celery, dice the onion, and mince the garlic. Rinse the chicken breasts and pat them dry with a paper towel.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Add Ingredients to the Slow Cooker</h3>
<p>Place the chicken breasts at the bottom of the slow cooker. Add the sliced carrots, celery, diced onion, and minced garlic on top. Pour in the gluten-free chicken broth, ensuring that the chicken is fully submerged. Add the bay leaves, dried thyme, salt, and black pepper.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cook on Low Heat</h3>
<p>Set your slow cooker to low heat and let it cook for 6-8 hours. This slow cooking process will allow the chicken to become tender and the flavors to develop fully.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Shred the Chicken</h3>
<p>After the cooking time is up, remove the chicken breasts from the slow cooker and shred them using two forks. Return the shredded chicken to the slow cooker.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Add the Gluten-Free Noodles</h3>
<p>Add the gluten-free noodles to the slow cooker and cook on high for an additional 20-30 minutes, or until the noodles are tender. Be sure to check the noodles periodically to avoid overcooking.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once the noodles are cooked, ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with freshly chopped parsley. Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
