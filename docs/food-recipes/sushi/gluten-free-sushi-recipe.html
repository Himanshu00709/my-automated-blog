By opting for gluten-free sushi, you can enjoy this Japanese delicacy without the worry of adverse health effects.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Gluten-Free Sushi Recipe</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Sushi Rice</h3>
    <p>Start by rinsing the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming too sticky. Cook the rice according to the package instructions. Once cooked, transfer the rice to a large bowl and let it cool slightly. In a small saucepan, combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt, heating until the sugar dissolves. Gently fold this mixture into the rice, being careful not to mash the grains.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Fillings</h3>
    <p>While the rice is cooling, prepare your fillings. If you’re using fish, ensure it’s sushi-grade and slice it into thin strips. For vegetables, slice them into matchstick-sized pieces. Popular gluten-free fillings include cucumber, avocado, and carrots. You can also use cooked shrimp or imitation crab, but be sure to check for gluten-containing additives.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Sushi Rolls</h3>
    <p>Place a nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top. Arrange your fillings in a line across the center of the rice. Using the bamboo mat, roll the sushi tightly from the bottom, pressing gently to ensure it holds its shape. Once rolled, use a sharp knife to slice the roll into bite-sized pieces.</p>

    <h3>4. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Arrange your gluten-free sushi on a platter and serve with gluten-free soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi. Enjoy your homemade sushi with the confidence that it’s both delicious and safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Sushi</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh fish and vegetables are key to great sushi. Always choose high-quality, sushi-grade fish if using raw seafood.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep Your Hands Wet:</strong> When handling sushi rice, keep your hands slightly wet to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Fillings:</strong> Don’t be afraid to get creative with your fillings. Gluten-free sushi is versatile and can accommodate a wide range of flavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Double-Check Labels:</strong> Always verify that your ingredients, especially soy sauce and rice vinegar, are certified gluten-free.</li>
    </ul>
