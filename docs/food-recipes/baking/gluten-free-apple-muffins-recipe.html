    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free apple muffins:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with coconut oil to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon. Ensure the ingredients are well combined to avoid lumps in your batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the unsweetened applesauce, eggs, melted coconut oil, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins. Gently fold in the diced apples.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fill the Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full. This allows room for the muffins to rise without overflowing.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 18-22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The tops should be golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Apple Muffins</h2>
    <p>Here are some expert tips to ensure your muffins turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that includes xanthan gum or add it separately to mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough muffins. Stir until just combined for a light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with add-ins:</strong> Feel free to add nuts, raisins, or even a sprinkle of oats on top for extra texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust sweetness:</strong> If you prefer sweeter muffins, increase the amount of honey or maple syrup slightly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>While almond flour can be used, it will result in a denser texture. For best results, stick to a gluten-free flour blend designed for baking.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and use maple syrup instead of honey.</p>

        <h3>How do I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze them for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature or reheat in the microwave.</p>

        <h3>Can I use other fruits instead of apples?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Pears, bananas, or even berries can be used as substitutes for apples. Adjust the sweetness accordingly.</p>
