    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free pumpkin muffins with cream cheese.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with oil. This will ensure that your muffins don't stick to the pan.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Make sure all the dry ingredients are well combined to ensure an even distribution of flavors.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix together the pumpkin puree, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Prepare the Cream Cheese Filling</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix the cream cheese and powdered sugar until smooth. This will be the filling for your muffins, adding a creamy, tangy contrast to the sweet pumpkin batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fill the Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Spoon a small amount of the pumpkin batter into each muffin cup, filling them about halfway. Add a teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture to the center of each muffin, then top with more pumpkin batter until the cups are about 3/4 full.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the muffins to be gluten-free. However, if you're baking for someone with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it's important to use a certified gluten-free flour blend.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the cream cheese with a dairy-free alternative, such as vegan cream cheese. Just make sure to check the labels to ensure it's gluten-free if necessary.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>These muffins can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate them for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or chocolate chips to the batter?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Feel free to customize your muffins by adding chopped nuts, chocolate chips, or even dried fruit to the batter before baking.</p>
