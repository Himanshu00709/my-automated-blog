<h1>Gluten-Free Kiffles Recipe: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>

<p>Kiffles, also known as Hungarian cream cheese cookies, are a beloved holiday treat that originated in Eastern Europe. These delicate, flaky pastries are traditionally filled with fruit preserves, nuts, or poppy seeds. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying kiffles can be a challenge. That’s where this gluten-free kiffles recipe comes in! With a few simple substitutions, you can create a version of this classic dessert that’s just as delicious and satisfying as the original.</p>

<h2>What Are Kiffles?</h2>

<p>Kiffles are crescent-shaped pastries made from a tender, cream cheese-based dough. They are typically filled with sweet or nutty fillings and dusted with powdered sugar. The dough is rolled thin, filled, and then folded into a crescent shape before baking. The result is a light, flaky pastry that melts in your mouth.</p>

<p>Traditionally, kiffles are made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets, many people have been looking for ways to enjoy their favorite treats without the gluten. This recipe uses a blend of gluten-free flours to achieve the same delicate texture and flavor as traditional kiffles.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum (if needed), and salt. In a separate bowl, beat the softened butter and cream cheese together until smooth and creamy. Add the granulated sugar and vanilla extract, and continue to beat until well combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms. Divide the dough into four equal portions, wrap each in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.</p>

<h3>2. Roll Out the Dough</h3>

<p>Once the dough has chilled, remove one portion from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface (using gluten-free flour), roll out the dough into a thin circle, about 1/8 inch thick. Use a pizza cutter or knife to cut the dough into 8 wedges, like a pie.</p>

<h3>3. Add the Filling</h3>

<p>Place a small spoonful of your chosen filling (fruit preserves or nut filling) at the wide end of each wedge. Carefully roll each wedge from the wide end to the pointed end, forming a crescent shape. Place the rolled kiffles on a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving some space between each one.</p>

<h3>4. Bake the Kiffles</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the kiffles for 12-15 minutes, or until they are lightly golden around the edges. Remove from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

<h3>5. Dust with Powdered Sugar</h3>

<p>Once the kiffles have cooled, dust them generously with powdered sugar. This not only adds a touch of sweetness but also gives them a beautiful, festive appearance.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Kiffles</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Chilling the dough is crucial for achieving the right texture. It makes the dough easier to handle and helps prevent it from spreading too much during baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Quality Fillings:</strong> The filling is the star of the show, so choose high-quality fruit preserves or make your own nut filling for the best flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Roll Thin:</strong> Rolling the dough thin ensures that the kiffles are light and flaky. If the dough is too thick, the pastries may become dense.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overfill:</strong> Be careful not to overfill the kiffles, as this can cause the filling to leak out during baking.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Kiffles</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. Just make sure it contains xanthan gum or add it separately to help bind the dough.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free kiffles?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Gluten-free kiffles freeze well. Once baked and cooled, place them in an airtight container or freezer bag and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>

    <h3>What fillings work best for kiffles?</h3>
    <p>Traditional fillings include apricot, raspberry, or prune preserves, as well as walnut or poppy seed fillings. However, you can get creative and use any filling you like.</p>

    <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, the dough can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or frozen for up to a month. Just let it come to room temperature before rolling it out.</p>
