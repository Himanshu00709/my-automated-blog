    <h1>Gluten-Free Oat Pumpkin Muffins: A Healthy Delight</h1>
    <p>When it comes to baking, finding the perfect balance between health and taste can be a challenge. However, gluten-free oat pumpkin muffins are here to save the day! These muffins are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients, making them an excellent choice for anyone looking to enjoy a guilt-free treat.

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Oat Pumpkin Muffins?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free oat pumpkin muffins are a fantastic option for those who need to avoid gluten due to celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.

Together, these ingredients create a muffin that is not only safe for those with gluten intolerance but also incredibly satisfying and nutritious.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free oat pumpkin muffins:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a muffin tin with paper liners or greasing it lightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Oats:</strong> In a blender or food processor, pulse the gluten-free rolled oats until they resemble a coarse flour. This will help create a finer texture for your muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the oat flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, maple syrup, eggs, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the Muffin Tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
