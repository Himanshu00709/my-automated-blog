    <h1>Gluten-Free Conchas: A Delicious Twist on a Mexican Classic</h1>
    <p>Conchas, the iconic Mexican sweet bread, are a staple in many households and bakeries.

    <h2>What Are Conchas?</h2>

They are characterized by their soft, slightly sweet dough and a crunchy, sugary topping that is often patterned to resemble a seashell.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by activating the yeast. In a small bowl, combine the warm milk (around 110°F) with a tablespoon of sugar and the yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum (if needed), remaining sugar, and salt. Add the activated yeast mixture, eggs, softened butter, and vanilla extract. Mix until a soft dough forms. Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</p>

    <h3>2. Let the Dough Rise</h3>
    <p>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size. This step is crucial for achieving the light and airy texture that conchas are known for.</p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Topping</h3>
    <p>While the dough is rising, prepare the topping. In a medium bowl, mix together the powdered sugar, gluten-free flour, softened butter, and vanilla extract until a smooth paste forms. If desired, divide the topping into portions and add a few drops of food coloring to each portion to create different colors. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>4. Shape the Conchas</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into 8-10 equal portions. Shape each portion into a ball and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Flatten each ball slightly with the palm of your hand. Take a portion of the topping and roll it into a ball, then flatten it into a disc. Place the disc on top of each dough ball and use a knife to create the classic shell pattern.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake the Conchas</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Let the shaped conchas rest for about 15-20 minutes while the oven heats up. Bake the conchas for 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and the topping is set. Allow them to cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Conchas</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. However, make sure it contains a binding agent like xanthan gum, or add it separately to ensure the dough holds together properly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these conchas dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the milk and butter with your favorite non-dairy alternatives, such as almond milk and vegan butter.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free conchas?</h3>
        <p>Store the conchas in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them and reheat them in the oven when ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough the night before and let it rise in the refrigerator overnight. Just make sure to bring it to room temperature before shaping and baking.</p>
