    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Carrot Cake Muffins</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>While almond flour can be used, it will change the texture of the muffins. Almond flour is denser and may result in a heavier muffin. If you prefer a lighter texture, stick to a gluten-free flour blend.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this recipe is naturally dairy-free as it uses vegetable oil instead of butter. However, always check the labels of your ingredients to ensure they are dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 3 months. Simply thaw at room temperature or reheat in the microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I add cream cheese frosting?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Cream cheese frosting pairs wonderfully with carrot cake muffins. To keep it gluten-free, ensure your cream cheese and powdered sugar are gluten-free.</p>
    </div>
