    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free apple cider muffins:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease the cups with a little butter or oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the eggs and vanilla:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Make sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the apple cider. Begin and end with the dry ingredients, mixing just until combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in optional add-ins:</strong> If you're using chopped apples or nuts, gently fold them into the batter at this stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the muffin cups:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full. This will allow room for the muffins to rise as they bake.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the muffins in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Muffins</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free muffins can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be able to achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that's specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right combination of flours and starches to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough, dense muffins. Mix just until the ingredients are combined, and don't worry if the batter is a bit lumpy.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the batter rest:</strong> Allowing the batter to rest for 10-15 minutes before baking can help the gluten-free flours absorb the liquid, resulting in a better texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the sweetness:</strong> If you prefer your muffins less sweet, you can reduce the amount of sugar in the recipe. Alternatively, you can add a bit more sugar if you like them sweeter.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the muffins to be gluten-free. Simply substitute the gluten-free flour blend with an equal amount of all-purpose flour.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can use a dairy-free butter alternative, such as coconut oil or a plant-based butter, in place of the unsalted butter. Just make sure to choose a product that's suitable for baking.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can keep them in the refrigerator for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply microwave them for a few seconds or warm them in the oven.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other mix-ins to the batter?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize these muffins with your favorite mix-ins. Consider adding dried fruit, chocolate chips, or even a streusel topping for extra flavor and texture.</p>
