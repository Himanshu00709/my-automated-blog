    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making these gluten-free pumpkin cheesecake muffins is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a batch of muffins that will impress your family and friends:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners. This will ensure that your muffins don't stick and are easy to remove once baked.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, and salt. This ensures that all the dry ingredients are evenly distributed, which is crucial for a consistent texture in your muffins.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix together the pumpkin puree, eggs, granulated sugar, and vanilla extract. Stir until the mixture is smooth and well combined. This wet mixture will give your muffins their moist and tender crumb.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Create the Cheesecake Filling</h3>
    <p>In another bowl, beat the softened cream cheese with a bit of sugar until smooth. This creamy filling will be swirled into the muffin batter, creating pockets of cheesecake goodness in every bite.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine and Fill</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense muffins. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about halfway. Add a dollop of the cream cheese mixture to each muffin, then top with more batter. Use a toothpick to swirl the cream cheese into the batter for a marbled effect.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake and Cool</h3>
    <p>Bake the muffins for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly. Almond flour or oat flour can be used, but you may need to adjust the liquid content accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the cream cheese with a dairy-free alternative, such as cashew cream cheese or coconut cream cheese. Just ensure that the substitute has a similar consistency to regular cream cheese.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months. Simply thaw at room temperature or reheat in the microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or chocolate chips?</h3>
        <p>Yes, feel free to customize your muffins by adding chopped nuts, chocolate chips, or even dried fruit. Just fold them into the batter before filling the muffin cups.</p>
