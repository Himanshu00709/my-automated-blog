    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free oatmeal pumpkin muffins:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with coconut oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Oats:</strong> In a blender or food processor, pulse the gluten-free rolled oats until they resemble a coarse flour. This step helps create a finer texture for the muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the oat flour, almond flour, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Stir well to ensure even distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs (or flax eggs), maple syrup, and melted coconut oil until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the Muffin Tin:</strong> Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
