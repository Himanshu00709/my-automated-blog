    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to make your gluten-free apple muffins:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, beat the eggs and then add the applesauce, honey (or maple syrup), melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the apples:</strong> Gently fold in the chopped apples into the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the muffin tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Apple Muffins</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free apple muffins turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use fresh apples:</strong> Fresh, crisp apples like Granny Smith or Honeycrisp work best for this recipe. They provide a nice balance of sweetness and tartness.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense muffins. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking your muffins at the 18-minute mark. If the toothpick comes out clean, they’re done.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze them for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>
