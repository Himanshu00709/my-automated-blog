    <h1>Gluten-Free Mango Muffins: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>Muffins are a beloved snack for many, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a delicious and safe option can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free mango muffins—a tropical twist on a classic treat that’s not only safe for gluten-free diets but also packed with flavor and nutrients. In this blog post, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free baking, the nutritional value of mangoes, and provide a step-by-step guide to making your own gluten-free mango muffins at home.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity in recent years, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also among individuals looking to improve their overall health. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and inflammation in some people. By opting for gluten-free baked goods, you can enjoy your favorite treats without the discomfort or health risks associated with gluten consumption.</p>

    <h2>The Nutritional Power of Mangoes</h2>
    <p>Mangoes are not only delicious but also incredibly nutritious. They are rich in vitamins A and C, which are essential for immune function and skin health. Mangoes also contain antioxidants like beta-carotene, which can help protect your cells from damage. Additionally, they are a good source of dietary fiber, which aids in digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut. Incorporating mangoes into your baked goods is a great way to add natural sweetness and a boost of nutrients.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free mango muffins:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a muffin tin with paper liners or greasing it lightly with coconut oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the mango puree:</strong> Peel and dice the ripe mangoes, then blend them in a food processor or blender until smooth. You should have about 1 cup of puree.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the wet ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, melted coconut oil, honey or maple syrup, and vanilla extract until well combined. Add the mango puree and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the muffin tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
