    <h1>Gluten-Free Mango Muffins: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>Muffins are a beloved snack for many, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a tasty and safe option can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free mango muffins—a delightful combination of tropical flavor and health-conscious ingredients. These muffins are not only gluten-free but also packed with the natural sweetness of mangoes, making them a perfect treat for breakfast, a snack, or even dessert. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free baking, the nutritional value of mangoes, and provide a step-by-step guide to making your own gluten-free mango muffins at home.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity not only among those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance but also among individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and inflammation in some people. By opting for gluten-free baked goods, you can enjoy your favorite treats without the discomfort. Additionally, gluten-free baking often incorporates nutrient-dense flours like almond, coconut, or oat flour, which can add extra health benefits to your muffins.</p>

    <h2>The Nutritional Power of Mangoes</h2>
    <p>Mangoes are not just delicious; they are also a nutritional powerhouse. Rich in vitamins A and C, mangoes support immune function, skin health, and vision. They also contain antioxidants like quercetin, beta-carotene, and astragalin, which help combat oxidative stress and inflammation. The natural sweetness of mangoes means you can reduce the amount of added sugar in your muffins, making them a healthier option. Plus, the fiber content in mangoes aids in digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the process of making these delicious gluten-free mango muffins:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with coconut oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, beat the eggs (or flax eggs) and then add the mango puree, honey or maple syrup, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Mix until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in diced mango:</strong> Gently fold in the diced mango pieces to add extra texture and flavor to your muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill muffin cups:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
