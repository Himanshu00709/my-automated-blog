    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, salt, and sugar. In a separate small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy. Add the yeast mixture and milk to the dry ingredients, and mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough gently for a few minutes until it becomes smooth. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Laminate the Dough</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the butter block. Place the cold butter between two sheets of parchment paper and roll it out into a rectangle about ½ inch thick. Remove the dough from the fridge and roll it out into a larger rectangle. Place the butter block in the center of the dough and fold the dough over the butter, sealing the edges. Roll the dough out again and fold it into thirds, like a letter. Repeat this process two more times, chilling the dough for 30 minutes between each fold.</p>

    <h3>3. Shape the Croissants</h3>
    <p>After the final fold, roll the dough out into a large rectangle. Cut the dough into triangles and place a small amount of chopped dark chocolate at the base of each triangle. Roll each triangle up from the base to the tip, forming the classic croissant shape. Place the shaped croissants on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let them rise for about 1 hour.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Croissants</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Beat the egg and brush it over the risen croissants to create a golden, shiny finish. Bake the croissants for 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and flaky. Allow them to cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend that is specifically designed for baking.</li>
        <li>Keep the butter cold throughout the lamination process to ensure flaky layers.</li>
        <li>Allow the dough to rest and chill between folds to prevent the butter from melting.</li>
        <li>Don’t skip the egg wash—it gives the croissants their beautiful golden color.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a dairy-free butter alternative?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a dairy-free butter alternative, but make sure it has a similar fat content to regular butter for the best results.</p>

        <h3>How do I store gluten-free chocolate croissants?</h3>
        <p>Store the croissants in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, freeze them and reheat in the oven when ready to eat.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough and complete the lamination process a day in advance. Keep the dough refrigerated and shape the croissants the next day.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour blend for croissants?</h3>
        <p>A blend that includes rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch works well. Look for a blend that is specifically labeled for baking.</p>
