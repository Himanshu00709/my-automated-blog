    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making these muffins is a straightforward process, but there are a few key steps to ensure they turn out perfectly. Follow these instructions for the best results:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with oil. This will prevent the muffins from sticking and make them easier to remove once baked.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and pumpkin pie spice. This ensures that the dry ingredients are evenly distributed, which is crucial for a consistent texture in your muffins.</p>

    <h3>3. Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix together the pumpkin puree, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and well combined. The pumpkin puree adds moisture and flavor, while the sugars provide sweetness and help with browning.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense muffins. The batter should be thick but pourable.</p>

    <h3>5. Prepare the Cream Cheese Filling</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. You can add a tablespoon of sugar if you prefer a slightly sweeter filling. This step ensures that the cream cheese is easy to work with and will create a smooth, creamy layer in the muffins.</p>

    <h3>6. Assemble the Muffins</h3>
    <p>Fill each muffin cup about halfway with the pumpkin batter. Then, add a dollop of cream cheese filling to the center of each muffin. Top with more pumpkin batter, ensuring the cream cheese is fully covered. This layering technique ensures that each bite has a perfect balance of pumpkin and cream cheese.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake and Cool</h3>
    <p>Bake the muffins for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the pumpkin part of the muffin comes out clean. Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. This step is crucial to prevent the muffins from becoming soggy.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>Here are a few tips to ensure your gluten-free pumpkin cream cheese muffins turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense, tough muffins. Mix until just combined for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Ovens can vary, so start checking your muffins at the 20-minute mark. The toothpick test is a reliable way to ensure they're fully baked.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> These muffins can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. They also freeze well for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin puree?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh pumpkin puree if you prefer. Simply roast a sugar pumpkin, remove the skin, and blend the flesh until smooth. Make sure to drain any excess liquid to avoid a soggy batter.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the cream cheese with a dairy-free alternative, such as vegan cream cheese. Just make sure to choose a brand that you enjoy, as the flavor will impact the final product.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or chocolate chips to the muffins?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize these muffins to your liking. Adding chopped nuts, such as pecans or walnuts, or chocolate chips can add extra texture and flavor. Just fold them into the batter before assembling the muffins.</p>

        <h3>How do I know if my gluten-free flour blend contains xanthan gum?</h3>
        <p>Check the ingredient list on the packaging. If xanthan gum is not included, you can add 1/2 teaspoon per cup of flour to help with the texture.</p>
    </div>
