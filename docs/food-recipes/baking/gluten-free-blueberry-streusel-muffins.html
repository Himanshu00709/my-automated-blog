<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free blueberry streusel muffins.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with butter or cooking spray.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Make the Streusel Topping</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, brown sugar, and cinnamon for the streusel topping. Cut the cold butter into small pieces and add it to the mixture. Use your fingers or a pastry cutter to blend the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk. Mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Fold in the Blueberries</h3>
<p>Gently fold the fresh blueberries into the batter. If you’re using frozen blueberries, make sure to toss them in a little gluten-free flour before adding them to the batter to prevent them from sinking to the bottom.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Fill the Muffin Tin</h3>
<p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full. Sprinkle the streusel topping evenly over the top of each muffin.</p>

<h3>Step 8: Bake and Cool</h3>
<p>Bake the muffins in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries. Just make sure to toss them in a little gluten-free flour before adding them to the batter to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the muffins.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a non-dairy milk like almond milk or oat milk instead of buttermilk.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
    <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute the blueberries with other fruits like raspberries, blackberries, or even diced apples. Just make sure to adjust the sugar accordingly if the fruit is particularly tart.</p>
</div>
