    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making these gluten-free pumpkin streusel muffins is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to ensure your muffins turn out perfectly:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease the cups with a bit of oil to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and pumpkin pie spice. Ensure the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the batter.</p>

    <h3>3. Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs, and vegetable oil until smooth. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense muffins.</p>

    <h3>4. Prepare the Streusel Topping</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar, gluten-free flour blend, and softened butter (or dairy-free alternative) until crumbly. If desired, add gluten-free oats for extra texture.</p>

    <h3>5. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Spoon the muffin batter into the prepared tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full. Sprinkle the streusel topping evenly over each muffin. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Muffins</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be well on your way to muffin perfection:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough muffins. Stir until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure accurately:</strong> Gluten-free flours can be denser than regular flour, so it's important to measure carefully to avoid dry or crumbly muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the muffins cool:</strong> Gluten-free muffins can be more delicate when warm, so allow them to cool completely before serving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make these muffins dairy-free by using a dairy-free butter alternative in the streusel topping and ensuring your other ingredients are dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! These muffins freeze well. Allow them to cool completely, then store them in an airtight container or freezer bag for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature or reheat in the microwave.</p>

        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh pumpkin puree. Just make sure it's smooth and not too watery. If it's too wet, you may need to adjust the amount of flour slightly.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of pumpkin pie spice?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have pumpkin pie spice, you can make your own by mixing 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon of cloves.</p>
    </div>
