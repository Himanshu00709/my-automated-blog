<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

<p>If you’re using store-bought gluten-free pizza dough, let it come to room temperature for easier handling. If you’re making your own, follow your favorite gluten-free pizza dough recipe. Once the dough is ready, roll it into small, bite-sized balls, about 1 inch in diameter.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Coat the Dough Balls</h3>

<p>In a small bowl, mix the granulated sugar and cinnamon. Dip each dough ball into the melted butter, then roll it in the cinnamon-sugar mixture until fully coated. Place the coated balls into a greased bundt pan, layering them evenly. If you’re adding nuts or raisins, sprinkle them between the layers.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Prepare the Glaze</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, mix the brown sugar, remaining melted butter, and vanilla extract. Pour this mixture evenly over the dough balls in the bundt pan. This will create the gooey, caramel-like glaze that monkey bread is known for.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Bake to Perfection</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the monkey bread for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the glaze is bubbling. Let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before inverting it onto a serving plate.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Once the monkey bread has cooled slightly, pull it apart and enjoy! It’s best served warm, but it’s just as delicious at room temperature.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a Non-Stick Pan:</strong> To ensure your monkey bread comes out easily, use a non-stick bundt pan or grease it thoroughly.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overbake:</strong> Keep an eye on the bread as it bakes. Overbaking can make it dry, so remove it from the oven as soon as the top is golden and the glaze is bubbling.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add your favorite spices, such as nutmeg or cardamom, to the cinnamon-sugar mixture for a unique twist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use homemade gluten-free pizza dough?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! If you have a favorite gluten-free pizza dough recipe, feel free to use it. Just make sure the dough is well-risen and easy to handle.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make this recipe vegan by using a vegan gluten-free pizza dough and substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan margarine.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover monkey bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. You can also reheat it in the microwave for a few seconds to restore its gooey texture.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze monkey bread?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze monkey bread. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, then freeze for up to 2 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and reheat in the oven before serving.</p>
