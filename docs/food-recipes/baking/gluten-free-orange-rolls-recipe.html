    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by activating the yeast. In a small bowl, combine the warm milk (around 110°F) with the yeast and a pinch of sugar. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, sugar, and salt. Add the activated yeast mixture, melted butter, egg, orange zest, orange juice, and vanilla extract. Mix until a soft dough forms. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. In a small bowl, mix together the softened butter, brown sugar, and orange zest until well combined. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Rolls</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) into a rectangle about 12x9 inches. Spread the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Starting from the long side, roll the dough tightly into a log. Cut the log into 12 equal slices using a sharp knife or dental floss. Place the slices in a greased baking dish, cover with a towel, and let them rise for another 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Rolls</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Once the rolls have risen, bake them in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. While the rolls are baking, prepare the glaze by whisking together the powdered sugar and orange juice until smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the warm rolls before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. A blend that includes rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch usually works well for this recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these rolls ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the rolls up to the point of baking, then cover and refrigerate them overnight. In the morning, let them come to room temperature and rise for about 30 minutes before baking.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the baked rolls?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked rolls. Allow them to cool completely, then wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe bag. To reheat, simply thaw at room temperature and warm in the oven.</p>
    </div>
