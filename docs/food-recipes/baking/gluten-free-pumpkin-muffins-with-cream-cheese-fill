<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Cream Cheese Filling</h3>

<p>Start by making the cream cheese filling, as it needs to chill in the refrigerator while you prepare the muffin batter. In a small bowl, combine the cream cheese and powdered sugar. Mix until smooth and creamy. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to firm up while you work on the muffin batter.</p>

<h3>2. Mixing the Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in your batter.</p>

<h3>3. Combining the Wet Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Mix until the ingredients are fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth.</p>

<h3>4. Combining Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins. The batter should be thick but still pourable.</p>

<h3>5. Assembling the Muffins</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners. Fill each muffin cup about halfway with the pumpkin batter. Remove the cream cheese filling from the refrigerator and place a small dollop (about 1 teaspoon) in the center of each muffin cup. Top with more pumpkin batter, ensuring that the cream cheese filling is completely covered.</p>

<h3>6. Baking the Muffins</h3>

<p>Bake the muffins in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the pumpkin portion of the muffin comes out clean. Be careful not to overbake, as this can dry out the muffins.</p>

<h3>7. Cooling and Serving</h3>

<p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, these muffins are ready to be enjoyed! Serve them warm or at room temperature for the best flavor.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use a different gluten-free flour blend if you prefer. However, make sure that the blend you choose is suitable for baking and has a similar texture to all-purpose flour. Almond flour or coconut flour may require adjustments to the recipe.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! To make these muffins dairy-free, you can substitute the cream cheese with a dairy-free alternative. There are many dairy-free cream cheese options available in most grocery stores.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
    <p>These muffins can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, keep them in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze the muffins for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I add nuts or chocolate chips?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can customize these muffins by adding chopped nuts, such as walnuts or pecans, or even chocolate chips. Simply fold them into the batter before filling the muffin cups.</p>
</div>
