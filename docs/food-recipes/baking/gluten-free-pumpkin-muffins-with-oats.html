<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with coconut oil to prevent sticking.</p>

<h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free rolled oats, gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and salt. Stir until well combined.</p>

<h3>3. Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs, maple syrup, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract until smooth.</p>

<h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins. If desired, fold in chopped nuts or chocolate chips for added texture and flavor.</p>

<h3>5. Fill Muffin Tin</h3>
<p>Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full. This will allow the muffins to rise properly without overflowing.</p>

<h3>6. Bake</h3>
<p>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The tops should be golden brown and slightly springy to the touch.</p>

<h3>7. Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

<p>These gluten-free pumpkin muffins with oats are not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Pumpkin is rich in vitamins A and C, which support immune health and vision. Oats are a great source of soluble fiber, which can help lower cholesterol levels and promote digestive health. Additionally, using maple syrup as a sweetener provides a natural source of antioxidants and minerals like manganese and zinc.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the muffins to be gluten-free. However, the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these muffins vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and use a plant-based milk if needed. Ensure your oats and other ingredients are certified vegan.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
    <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I add other mix-ins?</h3>
    <p>Yes, feel free to get creative! Dried fruits, seeds, or even a swirl of almond butter can add extra flavor and texture to your muffins.</p>
