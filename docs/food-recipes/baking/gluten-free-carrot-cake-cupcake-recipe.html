<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with cupcake liners. This will ensure that your cupcakes don’t stick to the pan and are easy to remove once baked.</p>

<h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. This will ensure that all the dry ingredients are evenly distributed, which is crucial for achieving a consistent texture in your cupcakes.</p>

<h3>3. Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the vegetable oil and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined. The oil will help keep the cupcakes moist, while the vanilla adds a subtle sweetness.</p>

<h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense cupcakes. Fold in the grated carrots and chopped walnuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

<h3>5. Fill the Cupcake Liners</h3>
<p>Using a spoon or an ice cream scoop, fill each cupcake liner about two-thirds full with the batter. This will allow the cupcakes to rise evenly without overflowing.</p>

<h3>6. Bake</h3>
<p>Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 18-22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. The baking time may vary depending on your oven, so keep an eye on the cupcakes as they bake.</p>

<h3>7. Cool and Frost</h3>
<p>Once the cupcakes are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, frost the cupcakes with your favorite cream cheese frosting and enjoy!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. However, keep in mind that different flours may affect the texture and flavor of the cupcakes. Almond flour is recommended for its nutty flavor and moisture-retaining properties.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these cupcakes dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! To make these cupcakes dairy-free, simply use a dairy-free cream cheese frosting. You can also substitute the butter in the frosting with a plant-based alternative.</p>

    <h3>How should I store the cupcakes?</h3>
    <p>Store the cupcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. If you need to store them longer, you can refrigerate them for up to a week. Just be sure to bring them to room temperature before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze the cupcakes?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the cupcakes for up to 3 months. Wrap them individually in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe container. Thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>
</div>

<p>Gluten-free carrot cake cupcakes are a delightful treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and a little bit of care, you can create moist, flavorful cupcakes that are perfect for any occasion.
