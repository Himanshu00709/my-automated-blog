<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

<p>Start by activating the yeast. In a small bowl, combine the warm milk (around 110°F) with the granulated sugar and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. This indicates that the yeast is active and ready to use.</p>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum, and salt. Add the melted butter, egg, and the activated yeast mixture. Mix everything together until a soft dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, you can add a little more flour, but be careful not to overdo it.</p>

<h3>2. Let the Dough Rise</h3>

<p>Once the dough is ready, cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. The dough should double in size. This step is crucial for achieving the right texture in your gluten-free caramel rolls.</p>

<h3>3. Prepare the Caramel Sauce</h3>

<p>While the dough is rising, you can prepare the caramel sauce. In a saucepan, combine the brown sugar, heavy cream, and vanilla extract. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture has thickened slightly. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>

<h3>4. Roll Out the Dough</h3>

<p>After the dough has risen, roll it out on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about ¼ inch thick. Sprinkle the ground cinnamon evenly over the surface of the dough. Then, carefully roll the dough into a log, starting from one of the longer sides.</p>

<h3>5. Cut and Arrange the Rolls</h3>

<p>Using a sharp knife, cut the log into 12 equal pieces. Arrange the rolls in a greased baking dish, leaving a little space between each one. Pour the prepared caramel sauce over the top of the rolls, ensuring they are well-coated.</p>

<h3>6. Bake to Perfection</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the rolls for 25-30 minutes, or until they are golden brown and the caramel sauce is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture may vary. A blend of rice flour, almond flour, and tapioca starch often works well for gluten-free baking.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these rolls ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the dough and caramel sauce the night before and refrigerate them. In the morning, let the dough come to room temperature, assemble the rolls, and bake as directed.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftover caramel rolls?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover rolls in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. You can also freeze them for up to a month. To reheat, simply warm them in the oven or microwave.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free caramel rolls are a delightful treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and a little patience, you can create a batch of these soft, gooey rolls that are sure to impress. Whether you’re serving them for breakfast, brunch, or dessert, these rolls are guaranteed to be a hit. So, roll up your sleeves and give this recipe a try—you won’t be disappointed!</p>
