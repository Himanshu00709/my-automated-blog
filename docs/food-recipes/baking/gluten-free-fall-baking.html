<h3>1. Gluten-Free Pumpkin Bread</h3>

<p>Pumpkin bread is a fall classic, and this gluten-free version is just as moist and flavorful as the traditional recipe. To make it, you'll need:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1 ¾ cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon nutmeg</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups pumpkin puree</li>
    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
    <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix the dry ingredients in one bowl and the wet ingredients in another. Combine the two, pour into a greased loaf pan, and bake at 350°F for 50-60 minutes. Let it cool before slicing.</p>

<h3>2. Gluten-Free Apple Crisp</h3>

<p>Apple crisp is a comforting dessert that's perfect for chilly fall evenings. For the topping, use a mixture of gluten-free oats, almond flour, and a touch of cinnamon. For the filling, toss sliced apples with a bit of sugar and lemon juice. Bake at 375°F for 30-35 minutes until the topping is golden brown and the apples are tender.</p>

<h3>3. Gluten-Free Sweet Potato Muffins</h3>

<p>Sweet potatoes are a versatile fall ingredient that can be used in both sweet and savory dishes.

Bake at 375°F for 20-25 minutes, and you'll have a batch of moist, flavorful muffins that are perfect for breakfast or a snack.</p>

<h2>Tips for Successful Gluten-Free Baking</h2>

<p>Gluten-free baking can be a bit tricky, especially if you're new to it. Here are some tips to ensure your baked goods turn out perfectly:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Measure Accurately:</strong> Gluten-free flours can be denser than wheat flour, so it's important to measure your ingredients carefully.</li>
    <li><strong>Use a Flour Blend:</strong> A blend of different gluten-free flours (like rice, almond, and tapioca) will give you the best texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense, tough baked goods. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Moisture:</strong> Gluten-free baked goods can dry out quickly, so be sure to include ingredients like pumpkin, applesauce, or yogurt to keep them moist.</li>
    <li><strong>Let it Cool:</strong> Gluten-free baked goods often need more time to set, so let them cool completely before slicing or serving.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fall Baking</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>No, regular flour contains gluten, which is not suitable for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Always use a gluten-free flour blend for gluten-free baking.</p>

    <h3>2. What can I use as a substitute for xanthan gum?</h3>
    <p>If you don't have xanthan gum, you can use guar gum or psyllium husk as a substitute. These ingredients help bind the dough and give it the right texture.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I freeze gluten-free baked goods?</h3>
    <p>Yes, most gluten-free baked goods freeze well. Wrap them tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store them in an airtight container. They can be frozen for up to three months.</p>

    <h3>4. How do I know if my baked goods are done?</h3>
    <p>Use a toothpick or cake tester to check for doneness. Insert it into the center of the baked good; if it comes out clean, it's done. If not, bake for a few more minutes and check again.</p>
</div>
