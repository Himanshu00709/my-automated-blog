    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and xanthan gum. Mix well to ensure even distribution of the leavening agent. In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond milk, melted coconut oil, and maple syrup. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a soft dough forms.</p>

    <h3>2. Roll Out the Dough</h3>

    <p>Place the dough on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Roll the dough into a rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick. If the dough is too sticky, you can place a piece of parchment paper on top to make rolling easier.</p>

    <h3>3. Add the Filling</h3>

    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the coconut sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the rolled-out dough, leaving a small border around the edges. If you like, you can also add a drizzle of melted coconut oil or a sprinkle of chopped nuts for extra flavor.</p>

    <h3>4. Roll and Cut</h3>

    <p>Starting from one of the longer sides, carefully roll the dough into a tight log. Use a sharp knife or a piece of dental floss to cut the log into 12 equal pieces. Place the rolls in a greased baking dish, leaving a little space between each one to allow for expansion.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake</h3>

    <p>Bake the cinnamon rolls in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. While the rolls are baking, you can prepare a simple glaze by mixing powdered sugar with a little almond milk and vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>6. Glaze and Serve</h3>

    <p>Once the cinnamon rolls are out of the oven, let them cool for a few minutes before drizzling the glaze over the top. Serve warm and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, oat flour, or rice flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary depending on the flour you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cinnamon rolls ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the dough and assemble the rolls the night before. Cover them tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate. In the morning, simply bake them as directed.</p>

        <h3>Are these cinnamon rolls suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this recipe is vegan-friendly as long as you use a non-dairy milk and ensure that your gluten-free flour blend is also vegan.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze these cinnamon rolls?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked cinnamon rolls. Allow them to cool completely, then wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe container. To reheat, simply thaw at room temperature and warm in the oven.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free, yeast-free cinnamon rolls are a delightful treat that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and a little patience, you can create a batch of these delicious rolls that are just as satisfying as the traditional version. Whether you’re serving them for breakfast, dessert, or a special occasion, these cinnamon rolls are sure to be a hit.
