    <h1>Gluten-Free Baking Powder Recipe: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Baking powder is a staple in many kitchens, essential for creating light and fluffy baked goods. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free baking powder can be a challenge. Many commercial baking powders contain additives or fillers that may include gluten, making it difficult to enjoy your favorite baked treats without worry. Fortunately, making your own gluten-free baking powder at home is simple, cost-effective, and ensures that your baked goods are safe to eat. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of creating your own gluten-free baking powder, discuss its benefits, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What is Baking Powder?</h2>

    <p>Baking powder is a leavening agent used in baking to help doughs and batters rise. It typically consists of three main ingredients: an acid (such as cream of tartar), a base (such as baking soda), and a moisture-absorbing agent (such as cornstarch). When combined with liquid, baking powder releases carbon dioxide gas, which causes the dough or batter to expand and rise. This process is crucial for creating light, airy textures in cakes, muffins, and other baked goods.</p>

    <h2>Why Make Gluten-Free Baking Powder?</h2>

    <p>While most baking powders are naturally gluten-free, some brands may include additives or anti-caking agents that contain gluten. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, even trace amounts of gluten can cause adverse reactions. By making your own gluten-free baking powder, you can ensure that your baked goods are safe to consume and free from any hidden gluten. Additionally, homemade baking powder allows you to control the quality of the ingredients, avoiding unnecessary additives or preservatives.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Baking Powder</h2>

            <tr>
                <td>Baking Soda</td>
                <td>Acts as the base, providing the necessary alkalinity to react with the acid.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cream of Tartar</td>
                <td>Acts as the acid, reacting with the baking soda to produce carbon dioxide gas.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cornstarch (or Arrowroot Powder)</td>
                <td>Absorbs moisture to prevent the baking powder from clumping and extends its shelf life.</td>
