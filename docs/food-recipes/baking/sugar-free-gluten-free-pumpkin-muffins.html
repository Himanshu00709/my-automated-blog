    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your own batch of sugar-free, gluten-free pumpkin muffins:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with coconut oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the almond flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Whisk together until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs, stevia or monk fruit sweetener, vanilla extract, and melted coconut oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the Muffin Tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
