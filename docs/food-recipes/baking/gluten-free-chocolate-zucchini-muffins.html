    <h1>Gluten-Free Chocolate Zucchini Muffins: A Healthy Indulgence</h1>
    <p>When it comes to baking, finding the perfect balance between indulgence and health can be a challenge.

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Chocolate Zucchini Muffins?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has gained immense popularity in recent years, and for good reason.

    <p>Adding zucchini to the mix not only enhances the nutritional profile of these muffins but also ensures they remain moist and tender. Zucchini is a low-calorie vegetable rich in vitamins A and C, potassium, and fiber. When combined with gluten-free flour and dark chocolate, it creates a muffin that is both nutritious and delicious.</p>

        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, beat the eggs and coconut sugar together until smooth. Add the applesauce and vanilla extract, mixing until fully incorporated.</li>
