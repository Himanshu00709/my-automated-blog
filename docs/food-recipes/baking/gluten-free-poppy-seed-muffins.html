    <h1>Gluten-Free Poppy Seed Muffins: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular as more people discover the benefits of a gluten-free diet, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply a desire for healthier eating. Among the many gluten-free baked goods, poppy seed muffins stand out as a delightful treat that combines a unique texture with a burst of flavor.

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Poppy Seed Muffins?</h2>

    <p>Poppy seed muffins are a classic favorite, but when made gluten-free, they become an even more versatile option for those with dietary restrictions.

Additionally, poppy seeds are rich in essential nutrients like calcium, iron, and magnesium, making these muffins not only delicious but also nutritious.</p>

    <p>For those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, gluten-free poppy seed muffins offer a safe and satisfying way to enjoy a beloved treat without the risk of adverse health effects. Moreover, gluten-free baking often incorporates healthier ingredients, such as natural sweeteners and whole grains, which can contribute to overall well-being.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your own gluten-free poppy seed muffins:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C) and lining a muffin tin with paper liners or greasing it lightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, poppy seeds, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk, honey or maple syrup, vanilla extract, and melted coconut oil or butter. Mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill muffin cups:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about two-thirds full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Poppy Seed Muffins</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free poppy seed muffins turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a reliable gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that is specifically designed for baking and contains xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough muffins. Stir until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with add-ins:</strong> While poppy seeds are the star of this recipe, feel free to add other ingredients like lemon zest, blueberries, or a sprinkle of cinnamon for extra flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Gluten-free muffins can dry out quickly. Store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze them for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>
