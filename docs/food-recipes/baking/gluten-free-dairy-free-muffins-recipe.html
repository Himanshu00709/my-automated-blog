    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions to make these gluten-free dairy-free muffins.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your muffins bake evenly and rise properly. While the oven is heating up, prepare your muffin tin by lining it with paper liners or lightly greasing it with coconut oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these dry ingredients together until they are well incorporated. This step ensures that your muffins have a uniform texture and rise evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the almond milk, melted coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Whisk these ingredients until they are well combined. The wet ingredients will help bind the dry ingredients together and add moisture to the muffins.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Gently fold the mixture together until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins. If you’re adding berries or chocolate chips, gently fold them in at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fill the Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or an ice cream scoop, fill each muffin cup about two-thirds full with the batter. This allows room for the muffins to rise without overflowing. If you want to add a decorative touch, you can sprinkle a few extra berries or chocolate chips on top of each muffin.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Muffins</h3>
    <p>Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The baking time may vary slightly depending on your oven, so keep an eye on them after the 20-minute mark.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the muffins are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool in the tin for about 5 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature, and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours like almond flour, oat flour, or coconut flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly. If you’re using almond or coconut flour, you may need to adjust the amount of liquid in the recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This recipe is already vegan if you use maple syrup instead of honey. Just ensure that all your ingredients, including the chocolate chips, are vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply microwave them for a few seconds or warm them in the oven.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other mix-ins?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize these muffins with your favorite mix-ins. Consider adding nuts, seeds, dried fruits, or even a swirl of nut butter for added flavor and texture.</p>
