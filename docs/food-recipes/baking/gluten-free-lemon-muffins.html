    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Lemon Muffins</h2>

    <p>Now that we’ve covered the key ingredients, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making these delightful gluten-free lemon muffins.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with oil to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 ½ cups of gluten-free flour blend, ½ cup of almond flour, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Whisk these dry ingredients together to ensure they are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together 2 large eggs, ½ cup of Greek yogurt, ⅓ cup of honey or maple syrup, ¼ cup of melted coconut oil, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, the zest of 2 lemons, and the juice of 1 lemon. Mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fill Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about ¾ full. This allows room for the muffins to rise without overflowing.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The tops should be golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>
