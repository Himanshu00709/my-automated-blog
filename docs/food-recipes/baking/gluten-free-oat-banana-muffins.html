    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free oat banana muffins is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create your own batch:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Oats:</strong> In a blender or food processor, grind the gluten-free oats into a fine flour. This will serve as the base for your muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash the Bananas:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. Add the eggs, almond milk, maple syrup, and vanilla extract, and mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, combine the oat flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the Muffin Tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy warm or at room temperature.</li>
