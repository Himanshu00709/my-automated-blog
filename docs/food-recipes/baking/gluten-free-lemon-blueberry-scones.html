    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free lemon blueberry scones:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut in the butter:</strong> Add the cold butter to the dry ingredients and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Add sugar and lemon zest:</strong> Stir in the granulated sugar and lemon zest until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, egg, and vanilla extract. Pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in blueberries:</strong> Gently fold in the fresh blueberries, being careful not to crush them.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a circle about 1 inch thick. Cut the circle into 8 wedges.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the scones to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy with a cup of tea or coffee!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Scones</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free scones can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be well on your way to success:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use cold butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for creating flaky layers in your scones. Make sure your butter is straight from the fridge.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough scones. Mix the dough until just combined, and handle it as little as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose the right flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will give you the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Add a glaze:</strong> For an extra touch of sweetness, consider adding a simple lemon glaze made from powdered sugar and lemon juice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries, but be sure to add them to the dough while they are still frozen. This will help prevent them from bleeding into the dough and turning it purple.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these scones dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the heavy cream with a dairy-free alternative like coconut cream, and use a dairy-free butter substitute. Just make sure to choose options that are suitable for baking.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftover scones?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover scones in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the scones and reheat them in the oven when ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other fruits to these scones?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize these scones with other fruits like raspberries, blackberries, or even diced apples. Just keep in mind that the moisture content of different fruits may affect the texture of the scones.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free lemon blueberry scones are a delightful treat that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. With their perfect balance of tangy lemon and sweet blueberries, these scones are sure to become a favorite in your household. Whether you're serving them for breakfast, brunch, or afternoon tea, these scones are a delicious way to start or end your day. So why not give this recipe a try?
