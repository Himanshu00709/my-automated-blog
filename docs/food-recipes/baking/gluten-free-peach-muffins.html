    <h1>Gluten-Free Peach Muffins: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular, and for good reason. Whether you're managing celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply looking to reduce gluten in your diet, gluten-free recipes can be both delicious and nutritious. One such recipe that stands out is gluten-free peach muffins. These muffins are not only moist and flavorful but also packed with the natural sweetness of fresh peaches. In this blog post, we'll explore everything you need to know about making gluten-free peach muffins, from the ingredients to the baking process, and even some tips for perfecting your recipe.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Peach Muffins?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free peach muffins are a fantastic option for anyone looking to enjoy a sweet treat without the gluten. Peaches are a great source of vitamins A and C, and they add a natural sweetness that reduces the need for excessive sugar. Additionally, gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free flour blend can provide a unique texture and flavor that traditional wheat flour cannot. These muffins are perfect for breakfast, a snack, or even a dessert.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free peach muffins.</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your muffins bake evenly and rise properly.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with butter or oil to prevent sticking.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. This ensures that the leavening agents are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, melted butter (or coconut oil), sugar, and vanilla extract until well combined.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense muffins.</p>
    <h3>Step 6: Fold in the Peaches</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the diced peaches, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>
    <h3>Step 7: Fill the Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 2/3 full. This allows room for the muffins to rise.</p>
    <h3>Step 8: Bake the Muffins</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</p>
    <h3>Step 9: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Peach Muffins</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free peach muffins turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Peaches:</strong> Fresh peaches provide the best flavor and texture. If using frozen peaches, thaw and drain them well before adding to the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to dense muffins. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Use a toothpick to check if the muffins are done. If it comes out clean, they're ready.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>
