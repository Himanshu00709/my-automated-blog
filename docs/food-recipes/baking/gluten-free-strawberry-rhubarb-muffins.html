    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free strawberry rhubarb muffins.</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with coconut oil to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure they are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>3. Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>

    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, honey (or maple syrup), and melted coconut oil. Make sure the mixture is well combined and smooth.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</p>

    <h3>5. Fold in the Strawberries and Rhubarb</h3>

    <p>Gently fold the diced strawberries and rhubarb into the batter. This will ensure that the fruit is evenly distributed throughout the muffins.</p>

    <h3>6. Fill the Muffin Tin</h3>

    <p>Using a spoon or an ice cream scoop, fill each muffin cup about two-thirds full with the batter. This allows room for the muffins to rise without overflowing.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake to Perfection</h3>

    <p>Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The tops should be golden brown and slightly springy to the touch.</p>

    <h3>8. Cool and Serve</h3>

    <p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature, and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen strawberries and rhubarb?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries and rhubarb, but make sure to thaw and drain them well before adding them to the batter. Excess moisture can affect the texture of the muffins.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I add nuts or seeds to the batter?</h3>
