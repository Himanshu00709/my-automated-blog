<h1>Gluten-Free Cinnamon Muffin Recipe</h1>

<p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular, not just for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, but for anyone looking to explore healthier and more diverse dietary options. One of the most beloved baked goods is the humble muffin, and when you add the warm, comforting flavor of cinnamon, you have a treat that’s hard to resist.

However, even for those without these conditions, gluten-free baking can offer a variety of benefits.

Additionally, gluten-free baking can be a fun and creative way to experiment with different textures and flavors. This recipe uses a blend of gluten-free flours to achieve the perfect balance of softness and structure.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease the cups with a little butter or oil to prevent sticking.</p>

<h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the batter.</p>

<h3>3. Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, cream together the unsalted butter (or coconut oil) and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This step is crucial for creating a tender crumb in your muffins.</p>

<h3>4. Add the Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Then, mix in the vanilla extract. Gradually add the buttermilk (or almond milk) to the wet mixture, stirring until smooth.</p>

<h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense muffins. The batter should be thick but pourable.</p>

<h3>6. Fill the Muffin Cups</h3>
<p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about two-thirds full. Sprinkle the tops with cinnamon sugar for a sweet, crunchy topping.</p>

<h3>7. Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Bake the muffins in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The tops should be golden brown and slightly springy to the touch.</p>

<h3>8. Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. A blend of gluten-free flours usually works best for achieving a light and fluffy texture.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the butter with coconut oil and use almond milk or another dairy-free milk in place of buttermilk.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
    <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 2 months. Just thaw and reheat before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I add other ingredients like nuts or fruit?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can customize these muffins by adding chopped nuts, dried fruit, or even chocolate chips. Just be sure to adjust the baking time if necessary.</p>
