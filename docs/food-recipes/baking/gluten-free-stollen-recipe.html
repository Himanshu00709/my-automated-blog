    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by activating the yeast. In a small bowl, combine the warm milk (around 110°F) with a teaspoon of sugar and the yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and remaining sugar. Add the activated yeast mixture, softened butter, and eggs. Mix until a soft dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour, but be careful not to overdo it.</p>

    <h3>2. Add the Fruits and Nuts</h3>
    <p>Once the dough is ready, fold in the dried fruits, candied citrus peel, and chopped almonds. Make sure the ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the dough. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</p>

    <h3>3. Shape the Stollen</h3>
    <p>After the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently shape it into an oval loaf, about 10-12 inches long. Fold one side of the dough over the other, leaving a slight overlap, to create the traditional stollen shape. Place the shaped dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the stollen for 30-35 minutes, or until it’s golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly on a wire rack.</p>

    <h3>5. Dust with Powdered Sugar</h3>
    <p>Once the stollen has cooled, generously dust it with powdered sugar. For an extra festive touch, you can add a second layer of powdered sugar after the first has set.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Stollen</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend, but make sure it contains a mix of flours like rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch for the best texture. Avoid using single-grain flours like almond or coconut flour, as they won’t provide the right consistency.</p>

        <h3>How long does gluten-free stollen last?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free stollen can last up to a week when stored in an airtight container at room temperature. For longer storage, you can wrap it tightly and freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative like margarine or coconut oil, and use a non-dairy milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>Why is xanthan gum necessary?</h3>
        <p>Xanthan gum acts as a binding agent in gluten-free baking, helping to mimic the elasticity and structure that gluten provides in traditional dough. Without it, the stollen may crumble or fall apart.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free stollen recipe is a wonderful way to bring the flavors of the holiday season to everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. With its rich, fruity filling and soft, buttery texture, it’s sure to become a new holiday tradition in your home. Whether you’re baking it for yourself or as a gift, this stollen is a festive treat that everyone can enjoy. Happy baking!</p>
