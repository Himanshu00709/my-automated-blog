    <h1>Gluten-Free Lemon Blueberry Loaf: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>If you're looking for a delightful and healthy dessert that satisfies your sweet tooth without compromising your dietary needs, a gluten-free lemon blueberry loaf is the perfect choice. This moist, tangy, and slightly sweet loaf is packed with the vibrant flavors of fresh blueberries and zesty lemon, making it a crowd-pleaser for both gluten-free and non-gluten-free eaters alike.

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Baking?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has gained immense popularity in recent years, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among health-conscious individuals.

By opting for gluten-free alternatives, you can enjoy your favorite baked goods without the discomfort or health risks associated with gluten consumption.</p>
    <p>Moreover, gluten-free baking often incorporates nutrient-dense ingredients like almond flour, coconut flour, and oats, which can add extra fiber, protein, and healthy fats to your diet. These ingredients also contribute to a richer texture and flavor, making gluten-free baked goods just as satisfying as their traditional counterparts.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to bake your gluten-free lemon blueberry loaf:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with butter or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream butter and sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
        <li><strong>Add flavorings:</strong> Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
