    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free applesauce oatmeal muffins:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free rolled oats, gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, ground cinnamon, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the unsweetened applesauce, milk, eggs, honey or maple syrup, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. If using add-ins, fold them in at this stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill Muffin Tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
