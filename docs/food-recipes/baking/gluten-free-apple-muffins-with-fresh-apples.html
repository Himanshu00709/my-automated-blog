    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with butter or oil to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream together the unsalted butter (or coconut oil) and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins. Fold in the diced apples and milk (or almond milk) until the batter is smooth and evenly mixed.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fill Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full. This allows room for the muffins to rise while baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The tops should be golden brown and slightly springy to the touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Apple Muffins</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Apples:</strong> Fresh apples provide the best flavor and texture. Granny Smith or Honeycrisp apples are excellent choices for baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to tough muffins. Mix until just combined for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze them for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute apples with other fruits like pears, bananas, or berries. Just make sure to adjust the sugar content accordingly, as some fruits are sweeter than others.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can replace the butter with coconut oil and use almond milk or any other non-dairy milk to make the muffins dairy-free.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I know if the muffins are done?</h3>
        <p>Insert a toothpick into the center of a muffin. If it comes out clean or with a few crumbs, the muffins are done. If the toothpick has wet batter on it, they need more time to bake.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I add nuts or other mix-ins?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add chopped nuts, raisins, or even chocolate chips to the batter for extra flavor and texture. Just be mindful of any allergies or dietary restrictions.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free apple muffins with fresh apples are a delightful treat that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and a little care, you can create muffins that are moist, flavorful, and packed with the natural goodness of apples. Whether you’re new to gluten-free baking or a seasoned pro, this recipe is sure to become a favorite in your household.
