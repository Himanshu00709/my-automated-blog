    <h1>Gluten-Free Scones with Buttermilk: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular as more people discover the benefits of a gluten-free diet, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply a desire for healthier eating. Among the many gluten-free baked goods, scones hold a special place. They are versatile, easy to make, and can be enjoyed at any time of the day. In this article, we will explore the art of making gluten-free scones with buttermilk, a recipe that combines the rich, tangy flavor of buttermilk with the light, crumbly texture of scones.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Scones?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free scones are an excellent choice for those who need to avoid gluten but still want to enjoy baked goods. Traditional scones are made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, rice flour, or a gluten-free flour blend, can be used to create scones that are just as delicious and satisfying. The addition of buttermilk not only enhances the flavor but also contributes to the tender texture of the scones.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, salt, and sugar until well combined.</p>

    <h3>3. Cut in the Butter</h3>
    <p>Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, egg, and vanilla extract. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. If you're using any add-ins, fold them in at this stage.</p>

    <h3>5. Shape the Dough</h3>
    <p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a few times to bring it together. Pat the dough into a circle about 1 inch thick and cut it into 8 wedges.</p>

    <h3>6. Bake the Scones</h3>
    <p>Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until they are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>7. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the scones to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Scones</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Ingredients:</strong> Cold butter and buttermilk help create a flaky texture in the scones.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough scones. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to customize your scones with your favorite add-ins, such as dried fruit, nuts, or chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend that is specifically designed for baking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular flour if you do not need to avoid gluten. However, the texture and flavor may differ slightly from the gluten-free version.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these scones dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the buttermilk with a dairy-free alternative, such as almond milk or coconut milk, mixed with a tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to mimic the tanginess of buttermilk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free scones?</h3>
        <p>Store the scones in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the scones for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough and shape the scones, then refrigerate them overnight. Bake them straight from the refrigerator, adding a few extra minutes to the baking time if needed.</p>
