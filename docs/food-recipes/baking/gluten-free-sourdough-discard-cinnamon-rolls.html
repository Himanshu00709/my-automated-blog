    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Sourdough Discard Cinnamon Rolls?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking has come a long way, and sourdough discard is a fantastic way to add depth of flavor and texture to your gluten-free creations.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, sourdough discard, milk, melted butter, sugar, egg, baking powder, and salt. Mix until a soft dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour, but be careful not to overmix. Cover the dough and let it rest for 30 minutes to allow the flours to hydrate.</p>

    <h3>2. Roll Out the Dough</h3>

    <p>After the dough has rested, roll it out on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. If the dough is sticky, you can place a piece of parchment paper on top to make rolling easier.</p>

    <h3>3. Add the Filling</h3>

    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the cinnamon and brown sugar. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the rolled-out dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Gently press the filling into the dough to help it adhere.</p>

    <h3>4. Roll and Cut</h3>

    <p>Starting from one of the longer sides, roll the dough tightly into a log. Use a sharp knife or a piece of dental floss to cut the log into 12 equal pieces. Place the rolls cut-side up in a greased baking dish, leaving a little space between each roll to allow for rising.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. While the rolls are baking, you can prepare a simple glaze by mixing powdered sugar with a little milk or cream until you reach your desired consistency.</p>

    <h3>6. Glaze and Serve</h3>

    <p>Once the cinnamon rolls are out of the oven, let them cool for a few minutes before drizzling the glaze over the top. Serve warm and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular sourdough discard for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular sourdough discard, but keep in mind that the recipe is designed to be gluten-free. If you're not concerned about gluten, feel free to use regular sourdough discard.</p>

        <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best?</h3>
        <p>A blend of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch works well for this recipe. You can also use a pre-made gluten-free flour blend, but make sure it contains xanthan gum or another binding agent to help with texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cinnamon rolls ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the rolls up to the point of baking, cover them tightly, and refrigerate overnight. In the morning, let them come to room temperature before baking as directed.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover cinnamon rolls?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover cinnamon rolls in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. You can also freeze them for up to a month. To reheat, simply microwave for a few seconds or warm in the oven.</p>
