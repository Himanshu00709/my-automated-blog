    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Lemon and Poppy Seed Muffins</h2>

    <p>Now that we’ve covered the key ingredients, let’s walk through the process of making these delicious muffins:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and poppy seeds. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, melted butter (or vegan butter), milk (or dairy-free alternative), lemon zest, and lemon juice. Mix until the ingredients are fully incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fill the Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full. This allows room for the muffins to rise.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the muffins in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The tops should be golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Lemon and Poppy Seed Muffins</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and use a dairy-free milk and butter alternative.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other flavors to the muffins?</h3>
        <p>Certainly! You can add a touch of vanilla extract, almond extract, or even a handful of blueberries for a different twist on the classic lemon and poppy seed flavor.</p>
