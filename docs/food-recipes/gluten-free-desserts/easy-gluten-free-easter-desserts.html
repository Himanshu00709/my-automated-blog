<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Easter Desserts</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>

    <h3>2. Are gluten-free desserts healthier?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free desserts can be healthier for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, as they avoid the adverse effects of gluten. However, gluten-free desserts can still be high in sugar and calories, so it's important to enjoy them in moderation.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make these desserts ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, many gluten-free desserts can be made ahead of time and stored in an airtight container. Some desserts, like cookies and bars, may even taste better after a day or two as the flavors have time to meld.</p>

    <h3>4. Where can I find gluten-free ingredients?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free ingredients can be found in most grocery stores, either in the baking aisle or in a dedicated gluten-free section. You can also purchase gluten-free flours and other ingredients online or at specialty health food stores.</p>
