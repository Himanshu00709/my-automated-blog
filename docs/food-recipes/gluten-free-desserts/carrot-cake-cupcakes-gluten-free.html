    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free carrot cake cupcakes is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a batch of delicious, moist cupcakes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the wet ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, beat the eggs, sugar, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the carrots and optional add-ins:</strong> Gently fold in the grated carrots, and if desired, the chopped nuts and raisins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the cupcake liners:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared cupcake liners, filling each about two-thirds full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 18-22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the cupcakes to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Frosting Options</h2>
    <p>No carrot cake cupcake is complete without a delicious frosting. Here are a few gluten-free frosting options to consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cream Cheese Frosting:</strong> A classic choice, cream cheese frosting pairs perfectly with the spiced flavor of carrot cake. Simply mix together cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Dairy-Free Frosting:</strong> For a dairy-free option, use vegan cream cheese and dairy-free butter. Add powdered sugar and vanilla extract for a creamy, delicious frosting.</li>
        <li><strong>Maple Glaze:</strong> For a lighter option, drizzle the cupcakes with a simple maple glaze made from powdered sugar, maple syrup, and a splash of milk or non-dairy milk.</li>
    </ul>
