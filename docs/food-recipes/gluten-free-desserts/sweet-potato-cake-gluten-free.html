    <h1>Sweet Potato Cake: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>Sweet potato cake is a delicious and nutritious dessert that has gained popularity among health-conscious individuals and those with dietary restrictions. This gluten-free cake is not only a treat for your taste buds but also a powerhouse of nutrients. Whether you're gluten intolerant or simply looking for a healthier dessert option, sweet potato cake is a perfect choice. In this article, we'll explore the benefits of sweet potatoes, how to make a gluten-free sweet potato cake, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>Why Sweet Potatoes?</h2>
    <p>Sweet potatoes are a versatile root vegetable that is rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber.

When used in baking, sweet potatoes add natural sweetness and moisture, making them an excellent ingredient for cakes.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Baking</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular due to the rise in gluten intolerance and celiac disease. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause digestive issues and other health problems for those who are sensitive to it. By using gluten-free flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or rice flour, you can create delicious baked goods that are safe for everyone to enjoy. Gluten-free baking also encourages the use of whole, unprocessed ingredients, which can lead to healthier and more nutrient-dense desserts.</p>
