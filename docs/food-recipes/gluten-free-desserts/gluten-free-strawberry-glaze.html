A gluten-free strawberry glaze ensures that everyone can enjoy the sweet, tangy flavor of strawberries without worrying about gluten-related health issues.</p>

    <p>Moreover, making your own glaze at home allows you to control the ingredients, ensuring that it is free from artificial additives and preservatives. This not only makes the glaze healthier but also enhances its natural flavor.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Strawberry Glaze</h2>

        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch (ensure it’s gluten-free)</li>
