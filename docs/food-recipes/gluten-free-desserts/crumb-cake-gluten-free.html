    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Crumb Cake</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free crumb cake:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crumb Topping</h3>

    <p>In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup of gluten-free flour blend, 1/2 cup of almond flour, 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and a pinch of salt. Add 1/2 cup of melted unsalted butter and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Cake Batter</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups of gluten-free flour blend, 1/2 cup of almond flour, 1 teaspoon of xanthan gum, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. In a separate bowl, beat 1/2 cup of softened unsalted butter and 3/4 cup of granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add 2 large eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Cake</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch square baking pan. Spread the cake batter evenly into the prepared pan. Sprinkle the crumb topping evenly over the batter, pressing it down gently to adhere.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Cake</h3>

    <p>Bake the cake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once the cake has cooled, slice it into squares and serve. You can enjoy it as is or with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Crumb Cake</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as coconut flour, oat flour, or a pre-made gluten-free flour blend. Keep in mind that different flours may affect the texture and moisture content of the cake, so you may need to adjust the recipe accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or a plant-based margarine. Make sure to use a dairy-free milk substitute if the recipe calls for it.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free crumb cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add fruit to the cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add fresh or frozen fruit, such as blueberries, raspberries, or diced apples, to the cake batter for added flavor and texture. Just be sure to toss the fruit in a little gluten-free flour before folding it into the batter to prevent it from sinking to the bottom.</p>
