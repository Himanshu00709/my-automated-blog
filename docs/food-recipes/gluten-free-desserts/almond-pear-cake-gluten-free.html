    <h1>Almond Pear Cake: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

    <p>When it comes to gluten-free baking, the Almond Pear Cake stands out as a perfect blend of flavor, texture, and nutrition. This cake is not only a treat for your taste buds but also a healthier alternative for those who are gluten-intolerant or simply looking to reduce their gluten intake.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your Almond Pear Cake:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch round cake pan with butter or coconut oil. Line the bottom with parchment paper for easy removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, honey (or maple syrup), vanilla extract, and melted butter (or coconut oil) until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Pears:</strong> Gently fold in the sliced pears, reserving a few slices for the top of the cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour Batter into Pan:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Arrange the reserved pear slices on top and sprinkle with sliced almonds.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use other fruits instead of pears?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute pears with other fruits like apples, peaches, or even berries. Just make sure to adjust the baking time accordingly, as different fruits may release more or less moisture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake vegan?</h3>
        <p>To make this cake vegan, you can replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and use coconut oil instead of butter. Keep in mind that the texture may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months. Thaw it at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use almond meal instead of almond flour?</h3>
        <p>Almond meal is coarser than almond flour, so it may result in a denser texture. If you prefer a finer crumb, stick to almond flour. However, almond meal can be used in a pinch.</p>
    </div>
