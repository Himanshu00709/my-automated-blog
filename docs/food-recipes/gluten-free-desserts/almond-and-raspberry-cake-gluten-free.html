    <h1>Gluten-Free Almond and Raspberry Cake: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>When it comes to baking, gluten-free options have become increasingly popular, not just for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, but for anyone looking to explore new flavors and textures. One such delightful creation is the gluten-free almond and raspberry cake.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create your gluten-free almond and raspberry cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream butter and sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add eggs and vanilla:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in raspberries:</strong> Gently fold in the fresh raspberries, being careful not to crush them too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with powdered sugar before serving.</li>
    </ol>
