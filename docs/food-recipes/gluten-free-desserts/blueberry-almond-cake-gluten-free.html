    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your own Blueberry Almond Cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, honey (or maple syrup), vanilla extract, and almond milk until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Blueberries:</strong> Gently fold the fresh blueberries into the batter, ensuring they are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
