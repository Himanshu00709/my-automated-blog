    <h2>Gluten-Free Baking Tips</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to create delicious desserts with ease:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use the right flour:</strong> Gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour work well in many recipes. You can also use a gluten-free flour blend for a more versatile option.</li>
        <li><strong>Add xanthan gum:</strong> Xanthan gum helps to bind the ingredients together, giving your baked goods a better texture. Most gluten-free flour blends already contain xanthan gum, but if you’re using a single flour, you may need to add it separately.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense and tough baked goods. Mix your ingredients just until they’re combined to ensure a light and tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Check your ingredients:</strong> Always double-check that your ingredients are gluten-free, especially things like baking powder, vanilla extract, and chocolate chips.</li>
    </ul>
