    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing the Biscuits</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the Bisquick Gluten-Free mix, milk, sugar, and melted butter. Stir until the dough comes together. Drop the dough by spoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet, forming six equal-sized biscuits. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the biscuits are golden brown. Allow them to cool slightly before assembling the shortcake.</p>

    <h3>2. Preparing the Strawberries</h3>
    <p>While the biscuits are baking, prepare the strawberries. Wash and slice the strawberries, then toss them with a tablespoon of sugar to enhance their natural sweetness. Let the strawberries sit for about 10 minutes to release their juices, creating a delicious syrup.</p>

    <h3>3. Assembling the Shortcake</h3>
    <p>Once the biscuits have cooled, slice them in half horizontally. Place the bottom half of each biscuit on a plate. Top with a generous amount of the prepared strawberries and their syrup. Add a dollop of whipped cream, then place the top half of the biscuit over the whipped cream. Finish with another dollop of whipped cream and a few more strawberry slices for garnish.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Strawberry Shortcake</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh strawberries and high-quality whipped cream will elevate the flavor of your shortcake.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough biscuits. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a sweeter shortcake, you can add more sugar to the strawberries or the whipped cream.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Immediately:</strong> Strawberry shortcake is best enjoyed fresh. If you need to prepare it in advance, store the components separately and assemble just before serving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen strawberries?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries, but make sure to thaw and drain them well before using. Fresh strawberries are preferred for their texture and flavor.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the biscuits ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake the biscuits ahead of time and store them in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Reheat them slightly before assembling the shortcake.</p>
