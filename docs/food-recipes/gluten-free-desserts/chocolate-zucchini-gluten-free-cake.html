    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In another bowl, beat the eggs, sugar, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract until well combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Zucchini</h3>
    <p>Fold in the grated zucchini and chocolate chips (if using) into the batter. Make sure the zucchini is evenly distributed throughout the mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve as is, or with a dollop of whipped cream or a dusting of powdered sugar.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute gluten-free flour with all-purpose flour if you don’t have dietary restrictions. However, the texture and moisture level may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>How do I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this cake vegan by substituting the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and using dairy-free chocolate chips.</p>

        <h3>What other vegetables can I use?</h3>
        <p>While zucchini is the star of this recipe, you can experiment with other vegetables like carrots or sweet potatoes for a different twist.</p>
