    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free strawberry rhubarb crumble is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a dessert that will impress your family and friends:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced strawberries, chopped rhubarb, granulated sugar, and cornstarch. Toss everything together until the fruit is evenly coated. Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish, spreading it out evenly.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Crumble Topping</h3>
    <p>In another bowl, mix the gluten-free flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter to the mixture. Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, work the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. This will give your crumble its signature texture.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Sprinkle the crumble topping evenly over the strawberry-rhubarb mixture in the baking dish. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free strawberry rhubarb crumble is delicious on its own, but you can elevate it with a few simple additions. Serve it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. For a healthier option, try pairing it with Greek yogurt or a drizzle of honey. The possibilities are endless!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen strawberries and rhubarb?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries and rhubarb if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them well before using to avoid excess moisture in the filling.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free flour on hand, you can use almond flour or oat flour as a substitute. Keep in mind that these alternatives may slightly alter the texture of the crumble topping.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat the crumble in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dessert ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the filling and crumble topping separately and store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before assembling and baking. This makes it a convenient option for entertaining.</p>
    </div>
