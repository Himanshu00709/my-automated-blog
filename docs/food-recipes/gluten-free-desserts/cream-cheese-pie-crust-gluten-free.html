    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create a perfect gluten-free cream cheese pie crust:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> Ensure all ingredients are cold. This helps achieve a flaky texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut in the Fats:</strong> Add the cold cream cheese and butter to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut the fats into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Ice Water:</strong> Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough just comes together. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Dough:</strong> Gather the dough into a ball, flatten it into a disk, and wrap it in plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> On a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour), roll out the dough to your desired thickness. Transfer it to your pie dish and trim the edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake as Directed:</strong> Follow your pie recipe’s baking instructions, whether it’s a pre-baked crust or one that bakes with the filling.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free cream cheese pie crust turns out perfectly, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep Ingredients Cold:</strong> Cold ingredients are key to a flaky crust. If the dough becomes too warm, chill it before rolling.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overwork the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a tough crust. Mix just until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Good Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that’s specifically designed for baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill Before Baking:</strong> Chilling the dough before baking helps prevent shrinkage and ensures even baking.</li>
    </ul>
