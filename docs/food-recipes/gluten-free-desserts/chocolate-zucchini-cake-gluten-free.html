    <h1>Chocolate Zucchini Cake: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>When it comes to baking, combining health and indulgence can sometimes feel like a challenge. However, the chocolate zucchini cake is a perfect example of how you can enjoy a decadent dessert while still keeping it gluten-free and nutrient-packed.

    <h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Chocolate Zucchini Cake?</h2>

Even for those without gluten sensitivities, reducing gluten intake can lead to better digestion and overall health. The chocolate zucchini cake is an excellent choice for a gluten-free dessert because it uses alternative flours like almond or coconut flour, which not only make it safe for gluten-sensitive individuals but also add a rich, nutty flavor to the cake.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to bake your gluten-free chocolate zucchini cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, beat the eggs, then add the melted coconut oil, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract. Mix until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Zucchini:</strong> Fold in the grated zucchini and dark chocolate chips (if using) into the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
