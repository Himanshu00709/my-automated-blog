    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free lemon blueberry cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Flavorings:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Blueberries:</strong> Gently fold in the fresh blueberries, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Lemon Blueberry Cake</h2>
    <p>To ensure your cake turns out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh blueberries and lemon zest will give your cake the best flavor. Avoid using frozen blueberries, as they can release too much moisture and affect the texture of the cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking your cake for doneness a few minutes before the recommended baking time. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it Cool:</strong> Allow the cake to cool completely before slicing. This will help it set and make it easier to cut.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>While fresh blueberries are recommended for the best texture and flavor, you can use frozen blueberries if necessary. However, be sure to toss them in a little gluten-free flour before folding them into the batter to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the cake.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this cake dairy-free by substituting the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter, and using a dairy-free yogurt in place of Greek yogurt.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend you prefer. Just make sure it contains xanthan gum, which helps bind the ingredients together and gives the cake a better texture.</p>
