    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line two 8-inch round cake pans with parchment paper. This ensures your cake will come out easily after baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Melt the White Chocolate</h3>
    <p>In a heatproof bowl, melt the white chocolate using a double boiler or microwave. If using a microwave, heat in 20-second intervals, stirring in between, until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving a soft, airy texture in your cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla extract for added flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. This ensures even distribution of the leavening agents and prevents lumps in your batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined—overmixing can lead to a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Fold in Melted White Chocolate</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the melted white chocolate into the batter. This step infuses the cake with its signature rich flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Bake</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Frosting and Decoration</h2>
    <p>For the frosting, consider a white chocolate buttercream or a simple whipped cream topping. Decorate with fresh berries, edible flowers, or additional white chocolate shavings for an elegant finish.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use dairy-free alternatives?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter and milk with dairy-free alternatives like coconut oil and almond milk. Ensure the white chocolate is also dairy-free if needed.</p>

        <h3>How do I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or refrigerate for up to 5 days. Bring to room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this cake?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Wrap the cooled cake layers tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before frosting.</p>

        <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best?</h3>
        <p>A blend of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch works well. You can also use a store-bought gluten-free flour blend designed for baking.</p>
