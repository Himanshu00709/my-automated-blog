    <h1>Gluten-Free Lemon Bundt Cake: A Zesty Delight</h1>
    <p>When it comes to desserts, few things are as satisfying as a perfectly baked bundt cake. The combination of a moist, tender crumb and a zesty lemon flavor makes this gluten-free lemon bundt cake a standout treat.

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, but also among health-conscious individuals. Gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour, offer a lighter texture and a unique flavor profile that can enhance your baked goods. Additionally, gluten-free cakes often have a more delicate crumb, making them ideal for bundt cakes, which rely on their intricate designs to shine.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to bake your gluten-free lemon bundt cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease your bundt pan thoroughly to ensure the cake releases easily after baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Flavorings:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the Greek yogurt. Begin and end with the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared bundt pan and smooth the top. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting it onto a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with powdered sugar or drizzle with a lemon glaze before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Lemon Bundt Cake</h2>
    <p>Baking a gluten-free cake can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll achieve a perfect result every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until just combined to keep the texture light and airy.</li>
        <li><strong>Grease the Pan Well:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be more delicate, so ensure your bundt pan is well-greased to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Cake Cool Completely:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be more fragile when warm, so allow the cake to cool completely before removing it from the pan.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute regular all-purpose flour for the gluten-free flour blend if you don’t need the cake to be gluten-free. However, the texture and flavor may differ slightly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly and refrigerate for up to a week, or freeze for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil, and use a dairy-free yogurt. The flavor may vary slightly, but the cake will still be delicious.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of Greek yogurt?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have Greek yogurt, you can use sour cream or a dairy-free alternative like coconut yogurt. These substitutes will provide similar moisture and texture.</p>
    </div>
