<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, granulated sugar, and salt. Cut in the cold butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the egg and mix until the dough comes together. Press the dough evenly into the bottom of a greased 9x9 inch baking pan.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, combine the chopped strawberries, rhubarb, cornstarch, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Mix well until the fruit is evenly coated. Spread the fruit mixture evenly over the crust in the baking pan.</p>

<h3>3. Add the Topping</h3>

<p>For the topping, you can use the remaining dough or prepare a simple crumble topping by mixing gluten-free flour, almond flour, sugar, and cold butter. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the fruit layer.</p>

<h3>4. Bake</h3>

<p>Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Allow the bars to cool completely in the pan before cutting them into squares.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Strawberry Rhubarb Bars</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh strawberries and rhubarb will give you the best flavor. If fresh rhubarb is not available, you can use frozen rhubarb, but make sure to thaw and drain it well before using.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough becomes too soft while working with it, chill it in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes before pressing it into the pan.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> Depending on your preference, you can adjust the amount of sugar in the filling. If you prefer a tarter bar, reduce the sugar slightly.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store the bars in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. They can also be frozen for longer storage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen strawberries and rhubarb?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries and rhubarb. However, make sure to thaw and drain them well before using to avoid excess moisture in the filling.</p>
