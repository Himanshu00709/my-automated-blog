    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Gluten-Free Lasagna Noodles</h3>

    <p>Start by cooking the gluten-free lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Be sure not to overcook them, as they will continue to soften in the oven. Once cooked, drain the noodles and set them aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Meat Sauce</h3>

    <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until the onion is translucent. Next, add the ground beef or plant-based alternative and cook until browned. Stir in the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Dairy-Free Cheese Mixture</h3>

    <p>In a medium bowl, combine the dairy-free ricotta or tofu ricotta with half of the shredded dairy-free cheese. Mix well until the ingredients are fully incorporated. This mixture will add a creamy texture to your lasagna without the need for traditional dairy products.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Lasagna</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of gluten-free lasagna noodles over the sauce, followed by a layer of the dairy-free cheese mixture. Repeat the layers, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top. Sprinkle the remaining shredded dairy-free cheese over the final layer of sauce.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Lasagna</h3>

    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves for added flavor and presentation.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this lasagna vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make this lasagna vegan by using a plant-based ground meat alternative and ensuring that all other ingredients, including the dairy-free cheese, are vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of dairy-free ricotta?</h3>
        <p>If you can’t find dairy-free ricotta, you can make a tofu ricotta by blending firm tofu with a bit of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and salt. This will give you a similar texture and flavor.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten and dairy-free lasagna?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This lasagna freezes well. Simply assemble the lasagna as directed, but instead of baking it, cover it tightly with plastic wrap and aluminum foil, and freeze. When you’re ready to eat, bake it from frozen, adding an extra 20-30 minutes to the baking time.</p>

        <h3>What other vegetables can I add to the lasagna?</h3>
        <p>You can add a variety of vegetables to this lasagna, such as spinach, zucchini, mushrooms, or bell peppers. Just sauté them before adding them to the layers for extra flavor and nutrition.</p>
