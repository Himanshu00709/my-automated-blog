    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Gingerbread Cookies</h2>
    <p>Now that you’re familiar with the key ingredients, let’s dive into the recipe. Follow these steps to create your own batch of gluten-free, dairy-free gingerbread cookies:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dairy-free butter (softened)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup molasses</li>
        <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 flax egg (1 tbsp flaxseed meal + 3 tbsp water)</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground cloves</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Flax Egg:</strong> In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of flaxseed meal with 3 tablespoons of water. Let it sit for 5 minutes until it thickens.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the dairy-free butter, molasses, and brown sugar until smooth. Add the flax egg and mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Dough:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. This will make it easier to roll out.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll and Cut:</strong> On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use cookie cutters to cut out your desired shapes.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly browned.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Decorate:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, decorate with dairy-free icing or enjoy as is!</li>
    </ol>
