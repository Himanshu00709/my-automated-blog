    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it with a little coconut oil to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk these dry ingredients together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond milk, melted coconut oil, maple syrup (or honey), vanilla extract, and eggs (or flax eggs). Make sure the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Gently fold the mixture together until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins. If you're adding blueberries or chocolate chips, gently fold them in at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fill the Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or an ice cream scoop, fill each muffin cup about two-thirds full with the batter. This allows room for the muffins to rise without overflowing.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Muffins</h3>
    <p>Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 18-22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The baking time may vary slightly depending on your oven, so keep an eye on them after the 18-minute mark.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the muffins from the oven and let them cool in the tin for about 5 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free, dairy-free muffins warm or at room temperature!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Muffins</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Good Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of flours like rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough muffins. Mix until just combined for a light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Add-ins:</strong> Feel free to customize your muffins with your favorite add-ins, such as nuts, dried fruit, or even a sprinkle of cinnamon.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store your muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze them for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary. A blend of flours usually works best for a balanced texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons of water per egg) and use maple syrup instead of honey.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different sweetener?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other sweeteners like coconut sugar or agave syrup. Just be aware that the flavor and sweetness level may change slightly.</p>

        <h3>How do I know when the muffins are done?</h3>
        <p>Insert a toothpick into the center of a muffin. If it comes out clean or with just a few crumbs, the muffins are done. If the toothpick has wet batter on it, they need more time to bake.</p>
    </div>
