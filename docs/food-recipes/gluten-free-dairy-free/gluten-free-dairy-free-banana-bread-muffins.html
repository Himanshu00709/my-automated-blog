    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free dairy-free banana bread muffins:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it with coconut oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash the Bananas:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more flavorful your muffins will be.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Wet Ingredients:</strong> Add the eggs (or flax eggs), melted coconut oil, maple syrup (or honey), and vanilla extract to the mashed bananas. Mix well until all ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Ensure there are no lumps in the flour mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Optional Ingredients:</strong> If you're using chopped nuts or chocolate chips, fold them into the batter at this stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the Muffin Tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>These gluten-free dairy-free banana bread muffins are not only delicious but also offer several nutritional benefits:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rich in Potassium:</strong> Bananas are an excellent source of potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure and support heart health.</li>
        <li><strong>High in Fiber:</strong> Gluten-free flours, such as almond or oat flour, provide dietary fiber that aids in digestion and promotes gut health.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthy Fats:</strong> Coconut oil contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are easily absorbed by the body and provide a quick source of energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Natural Sweeteners:</strong> Using maple syrup or honey as a sweetener adds natural sugars without the need for refined sugars, making these muffins a healthier option.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours such as almond flour, oat flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Keep in mind that different flours may alter the texture and taste of the muffins slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make these muffins vegan, replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and use maple syrup instead of honey.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months. Simply thaw at room temperature or reheat in the microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other mix-ins?</h3>
        <p>Yes, feel free to get creative with your mix-ins! You can add dried fruit, shredded coconut, or even a swirl of nut butter for extra flavor and texture.</p>
