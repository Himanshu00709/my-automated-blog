    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Chicken and Dumplings</h2>

    <p>Now that we’ve covered the ingredients, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free, dairy-free chicken and dumplings. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure a successful and delicious outcome.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken and Vegetables</h3>

    <p>Start by cooking your chicken. You can use boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, depending on your preference. Cook the chicken in a large pot with a bit of olive oil until it’s fully cooked and no longer pink in the center. Once cooked, remove the chicken from the pot and set it aside to cool. In the same pot, add diced carrots, celery, and onions, and sauté them until they’re tender and fragrant.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Soup Base</h3>

    <p>Once the vegetables are tender, add the chicken broth to the pot. Bring the broth to a simmer, and then add your dairy-free milk of choice. Stir well to combine, and let the mixture simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Dumplings</h3>

    <p>While the soup is simmering, it’s time to prepare the dumplings. In a mixing bowl, combine your gluten-free flour blend with a pinch of salt and any herbs or spices you’d like to add. Gradually add water or dairy-free milk to the mixture until a dough forms. The dough should be soft but not sticky. Roll the dough into small balls or flatten it into small discs, depending on your preferred dumpling shape.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Dumplings</h3>

    <p>Once the dumplings are prepared, gently drop them into the simmering soup. Cover the pot with a lid and let the dumplings cook for about 10-15 minutes, or until they’re fully cooked and fluffy. Be careful not to overcook the dumplings, as they can become too soft and fall apart.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine and Serve</h3>

    <p>Once the dumplings are cooked, add the shredded chicken back into the pot. Stir everything together gently to combine, and let the soup simmer for a few more minutes to ensure everything is heated through. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning as needed. Serve the chicken and dumplings hot, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Chicken and Dumplings</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour for the dumplings?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. Almond flour, coconut flour, or a pre-made gluten-free flour blend will all work well. Just keep in mind that different flours may absorb liquids differently, so you may need to adjust the amount of liquid in the dough accordingly.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of dairy-free milk?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have dairy-free milk on hand, you can use water or additional chicken broth in place of the milk. However, using a dairy-free milk will give the soup a creamier texture, so it’s recommended if possible.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make gluten-free dairy-free chicken and dumplings ahead of time. Simply store the soup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. When you’re ready to serve, reheat the soup on the stovetop over low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent the dumplings from sticking together.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this dish?</h3>
        <p>While you can freeze the soup, the dumplings may become a bit mushy when thawed and reheated. If you plan to freeze the dish, consider making the soup base and dumplings separately, and then combine them after reheating.</p>
