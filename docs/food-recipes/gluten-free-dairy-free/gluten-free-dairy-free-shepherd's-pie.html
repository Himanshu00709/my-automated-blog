    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Mashed Potato Topping</h3>
    <p>Start by peeling and chopping the potatoes into even-sized chunks. Boil them in a large pot of salted water until tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot. Add the dairy-free butter and unsweetened almond or oat milk, then mash until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>2. Cook the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, cook the ground meat over medium heat until browned. Remove the meat from the skillet and set aside. In the same skillet, sauté the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Add the tomato paste and gluten-free flour, stirring to combine. Gradually add the gluten-free broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Return the cooked meat to the skillet and add the frozen peas. Simmer for 5-10 minutes until the mixture thickens.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer the meat and vegetable mixture to a baking dish. Spread the mashed potatoes evenly over the top, using a fork to create a textured surface. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this dish vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make this dish vegan by substituting the ground meat with a plant-based alternative like lentils, chickpeas, or a meat substitute. Ensure that all other ingredients, including the broth and butter, are vegan-friendly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free dairy-free shepherd's pie?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This dish freezes well. Assemble the pie as directed, but instead of baking, cover it tightly with plastic wrap and aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 3 months. When ready to eat, bake from frozen, adding an extra 20-30 minutes to the cooking time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have gluten-free flour on hand, you can use cornstarch or arrowroot powder as a thickening agent. Mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot powder with 2 tablespoons of cold water, then stir it into the filling mixture.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free dairy-free shepherd's pie is a testament to the fact that dietary restrictions don't have to mean sacrificing flavor or comfort. With a few simple substitutions, you can create a dish that is just as hearty and satisfying as the original. Whether you're cooking for yourself, your family, or guests with dietary needs, this recipe is sure to be a hit. So, roll up your sleeves, gather your ingredients, and get ready to enjoy a delicious, inclusive twist on a classic comfort food.</p>
