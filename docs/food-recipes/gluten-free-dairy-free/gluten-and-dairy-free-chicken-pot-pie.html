Dairy, on the other hand, contains lactose, which many people struggle to digest, leading to bloating, gas, and discomfort. By opting for gluten and dairy-free alternatives, you can enjoy your favorite dishes without the negative side effects.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that we’ve covered the ingredients, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten and dairy-free chicken pot pie.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by cooking your chicken. You can use pre-cooked chicken or cook it fresh. Once cooked, shred or dice the chicken into bite-sized pieces. In a large skillet, sauté diced onions, carrots, and celery in vegan butter or coconut oil until softened. Add garlic, thyme, and rosemary for flavor. Stir in gluten-free flour to create a roux, then slowly add gluten-free chicken broth and your choice of dairy-free milk. Cook until the mixture thickens, then add the cooked chicken and frozen peas. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>If you’re using a store-bought gluten-free pie crust, follow the package instructions for preparation. If you’re making your own, combine gluten-free flour, salt, and vegan butter in a food processor until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add cold water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Roll out the dough on a floured surface and place it over your pie dish, trimming any excess.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the chicken filling into the prepared pie crust. If you’re making a double-crust pie, roll out the second piece of dough and place it over the filling, sealing the edges. Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape. Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 30-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten and Dairy-Free Eating</h2>
    <p>Adopting a gluten and dairy-free diet can offer several health benefits, especially for those with intolerances or allergies. Here are some key advantages:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Digestion:</strong> Eliminating gluten and dairy can reduce bloating, gas, and other digestive issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Inflammation:</strong> Gluten can cause inflammation in some individuals, leading to joint pain and other symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Skin Health:</strong> Dairy has been linked to acne and other skin conditions in some people.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Energy:</strong> Many people report feeling more energetic after cutting out gluten and dairy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten and Dairy-Free Chicken Pot Pie</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour for the crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or a pre-made gluten-free flour blend. Each type of flour will yield a slightly different texture, so feel free to find the one that works best for you.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of vegan butter?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have vegan butter, you can use coconut oil or olive oil as a substitute. Keep in mind that this may alter the flavor slightly, but it will still work well in the recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the filling and crust ahead of time and store them separately in the refrigerator. When you’re ready to bake, simply assemble the pie and bake as directed.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe is dairy-free and can be made vegan by substituting the chicken with a plant-based protein like tofu or tempeh. Be sure to use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth as well.</p>

By making simple substitutions, you can create a dish that’s just as satisfying as the original, if not more so.
