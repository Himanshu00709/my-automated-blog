    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free dairy-free Yorkshire pudding is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to achieve perfect puddings every time:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Place a muffin tin in the oven to heat up while you prepare the batter. The hot tin is crucial for achieving the signature rise and crispiness of Yorkshire pudding.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend and salt. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and then add the non-dairy milk. Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, whisking continuously until you have a smooth batter. Let the batter rest for 10-15 minutes to allow the flour to hydrate.</p>

    <h3>3. Grease the Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Carefully remove the hot muffin tin from the oven and add a small amount of vegetable oil or dairy-free margarine to each cup. Return the tin to the oven for a few minutes until the oil is sizzling hot.</p>

    <h3>4. Pour the Batter</h3>
    <p>Quickly pour the batter into the hot muffin tin, filling each cup about halfway. Be cautious as the oil may splatter. Immediately return the tin to the oven.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the Yorkshire puddings for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and puffed up. Avoid opening the oven door during baking, as this can cause the puddings to deflate.</p>

    <h3>6. Serve</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the Yorkshire puddings from the oven and serve immediately. They are best enjoyed fresh and warm, alongside your favorite roast and vegetables.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free dairy-free Yorkshire puddings turn out perfectly, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the oil thoroughly:</strong> The key to achieving a good rise is to pour the batter into sizzling hot oil. This creates steam, which helps the puddings puff up.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense puddings. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the batter rest:</strong> Allowing the batter to rest before baking gives the flour time to absorb the liquid, resulting in a better texture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make Yorkshire pudding without eggs?</h3>
        <p>Eggs are a crucial ingredient in Yorkshire pudding, as they provide structure and help the puddings rise. While there are egg substitutes available, they may not yield the same results. If you’re looking for an egg-free alternative, consider exploring other gluten-free and dairy-free baked goods.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of non-dairy milk?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any non-dairy milk you prefer, such as almond, oat, soy, or coconut milk. Just make sure to choose an unsweetened variety to avoid altering the flavor of the puddings.</p>

        <h3>Can I make Yorkshire pudding ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yorkshire puddings are best enjoyed fresh out of the oven. However, if you need to make them ahead of time, you can reheat them in the oven for a few minutes to restore their crispiness.</p>

        <h3>What can I serve with gluten-free dairy-free Yorkshire pudding?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free dairy-free Yorkshire pudding pairs well with a variety of dishes, including roast beef, chicken, or vegetables. You can also serve them with gravy or a dairy-free sauce for added flavor.</p>
