<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Gluten-Free Lasagna Noodles</h3>

<p>Start by cooking the gluten-free lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Be sure not to overcook them, as they will continue to soften in the oven. Once cooked, drain and set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Sauce</h3>

<p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until the onion becomes translucent. Add the ground turkey or plant-based meat, and cook until browned. Stir in the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble the Lasagna</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of gluten-free lasagna noodles over the sauce, followed by another layer of sauce. Sprinkle a portion of the cashew cheese or dairy-free cheese on top. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of sauce and cheese on top.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Bake the Lasagna</h3>

<p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</h3>

<p>Garnish the lasagna with freshly chopped basil before serving. This adds a burst of freshness and flavor to the dish. Serve warm and enjoy!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free pasta?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use any type of gluten-free pasta that you prefer. However, lasagna noodles work best for this recipe as they provide the traditional layered texture.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of cashew cheese?</h3>
    <p>If you don't have cashew cheese, you can use any dairy-free cheese alternative, such as almond-based cheese or soy-based cheese. You can also make your own dairy-free cheese using nutritional yeast and soaked cashews.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this lasagna ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can assemble the lasagna ahead of time and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours before baking. Just be sure to let it come to room temperature before placing it in the oven.</p>

    <h3>Is this lasagna freezer-friendly?</h3>
    <p>Yes, this lasagna freezes well. After assembling, cover it tightly with plastic wrap and aluminum foil, and freeze for up to 3 months. When ready to bake, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and then bake as directed.</p>
