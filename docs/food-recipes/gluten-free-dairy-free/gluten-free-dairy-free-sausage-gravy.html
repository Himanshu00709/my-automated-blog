    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Sausage</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, cook the gluten-free sausage over medium heat until it’s browned and crumbled. Break it into small pieces as it cooks. Once done, remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside, leaving the drippings in the pan.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Roux</h3>
    <p>Add olive oil or dairy-free butter to the skillet with the sausage drippings. Sprinkle the gluten-free flour blend over the fat and whisk continuously to create a roux. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the mixture is smooth and slightly golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Dairy-Free Milk</h3>
    <p>Slowly pour in the unsweetened almond milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Continue to cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens. This should take about 5-7 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Season and Combine</h3>
    <p>Add salt, pepper, and any optional spices to the gravy. Return the cooked sausage to the skillet and stir to combine. Let the gravy simmer for another 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve your gluten-free dairy-free sausage gravy over gluten-free biscuits, toast, or hash browns. Garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or chives if desired.</p>
