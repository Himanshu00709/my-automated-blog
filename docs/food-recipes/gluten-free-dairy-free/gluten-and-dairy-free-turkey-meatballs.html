<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
<p>Start by gathering all your ingredients. Finely chop the onion and parsley, and mince the garlic. If you’re using a flaxseed egg as a substitute, prepare it by mixing 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed with 3 tablespoons of water. Let it sit for 5 minutes until it thickens.</p>

<h3>2. Mix the Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground turkey, gluten-free breadcrumbs, almond milk, egg (or flaxseed egg), minced garlic, chopped onion, parsley, salt, and pepper. Use your hands to mix everything thoroughly until well combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the meatballs tough.</p>

<h3>3. Form the Meatballs</h3>
<p>Once the mixture is ready, use a tablespoon or a small ice cream scoop to portion out the meat mixture. Roll each portion into a ball, about 1.5 inches in diameter. Place the formed meatballs on a plate or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

<h3>4. Cook the Meatballs</h3>
<p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the meatballs in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until the meatballs are golden brown and cooked through. You can also bake the meatballs in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 20-25 minutes, flipping them halfway through.</p>

<h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once the meatballs are cooked, serve them with your favorite gluten-free pasta, zucchini noodles, or a fresh salad. You can also pair them with a dairy-free marinara sauce for an extra burst of flavor.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>

    <h3>3. What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>

    <p>Yes, with a few modifications, these meatballs can be made keto-friendly. Replace the gluten-free breadcrumbs with almond flour or crushed pork rinds, and ensure that the almond milk is unsweetened. This will keep the carb count low while maintaining the texture and flavor.</p>
