    <h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Shepherd's Pie: A Comfort Food Revolution</h1>
    <p>Shepherd's pie is a classic comfort food that has been enjoyed for generations. Traditionally made with a rich meat filling and topped with creamy mashed potatoes, it's a dish that warms the soul. However, for those with gluten or dairy intolerances, enjoying this dish can be a challenge.

    <h2>Why Go Gluten and Dairy-Free?</h2>

Dairy, on the other hand, contains lactose, which many people have difficulty digesting.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by heating a large skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef or lamb and cook until browned. Drain any excess fat. Add the chopped onion, diced carrots, and peas to the skillet. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften. Sprinkle the gluten-free flour over the mixture and stir to combine. Gradually add the beef broth and tomato paste, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Dairy-Free Mashed Potatoes</h3>
    <p>While the filling is cooking, peel and chop the potatoes into chunks. Place them in a large pot of salted water and bring to a boil. Cook until the potatoes are tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot. Add the dairy-free butter and unsweetened almond milk. Mash the potatoes until smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer the meat filling to a baking dish and spread it evenly. Spoon the mashed potatoes over the top, spreading them out to cover the filling completely. Use a fork to create a decorative pattern on the surface of the mashed potatoes. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>
    <p>This gluten and dairy-free shepherd's pie is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. The ground beef or lamb provides a good source of protein and iron, while the vegetables add fiber, vitamins, and minerals. The dairy-free mashed potatoes are lighter and easier to digest for those with lactose intolerance, and using almond milk adds a subtle nutty flavor without the need for dairy.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the ground beef or lamb with ground turkey, chicken, or even a plant-based meat alternative for a vegetarian version.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What can I use instead of almond milk?</h3>
        <p>You can use any other unsweetened non-dairy milk, such as oat milk, soy milk, or coconut milk, depending on your preference.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the filling and mashed potatoes ahead of time and assemble the dish just before baking. It's a great make-ahead meal for busy weeknights.</p>
