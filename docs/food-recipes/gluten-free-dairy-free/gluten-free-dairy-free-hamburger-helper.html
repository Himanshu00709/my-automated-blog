    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Ground Beef</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. If using a plant-based alternative, follow the cooking instructions on the package. Drain any excess fat and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Pasta</h3>
    <p>Cook the gluten-free pasta according to the package instructions. Be careful not to overcook, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy. Drain and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet used for the beef, add the gluten-free flour and stir to create a roux. Gradually whisk in the dairy-free milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Add the tomato sauce and spices, and bring to a simmer. Stir in the dairy-free cheese until melted and smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Everything</h3>
    <p>Add the cooked ground beef and pasta to the skillet with the sauce. Stir well to combine and heat through. Adjust seasoning to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve your gluten-free dairy-free Hamburger Helper hot, garnished with fresh herbs if desired. Enjoy this comforting dish with a side salad or steamed vegetables for a complete meal.</p>
