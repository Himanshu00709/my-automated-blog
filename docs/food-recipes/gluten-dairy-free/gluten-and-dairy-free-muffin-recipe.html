<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get baking! Follow these simple steps to create your gluten and dairy-free muffins:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or lightly grease it with coconut oil to prevent sticking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and coconut sugar. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, mix the almond milk and apple cider vinegar. Let it sit for a minute to curdle slightly. Then, add the melted coconut oil, vanilla extract, and eggs (or flax eggs). Whisk until the mixture is smooth and well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Gently fold the mixture together until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins. If you're adding berries or chocolate chips, gently fold them in at this stage.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Fill the Muffin Tin</h3>

<p>Using a spoon or an ice cream scoop, divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling each about two-thirds full. This allows room for the muffins to rise without overflowing.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake to Perfection</h3>

<p>Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 18-22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The tops should be golden brown and slightly springy to the touch.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Cool and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Once baked, remove the muffins from the oven and let them cool in the tin for about 5 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten and dairy-free muffins warm or at room temperature!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours like oat flour, rice flour, or a pre-made gluten-free flour blend. Just ensure that the blend contains xanthan gum to help with texture.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these muffins vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and ensure that your chocolate chips or other add-ins are vegan-friendly.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
    <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months. Just thaw at room temperature or reheat in the microwave before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I add other mix-ins?</h3>
    <p>Yes, feel free to get creative with your mix-ins! Nuts, seeds, dried fruit, or even shredded coconut can add extra flavor and texture to your muffins.</p>
