    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create perfect gluten-free lemon poppy seed muffins:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your muffins bake evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Muffin Tin:</strong> Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with butter or oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. This ensures that the leavening agents are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream together the unsalted butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for creating a tender crumb.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Lemon:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the lemon zest and juice. The lemon zest is where most of the flavor comes from, so don’t skip it!</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined; overmixing can lead to dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Poppy Seeds:</strong> Gently fold in the poppy seeds to distribute them evenly throughout the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill Muffin Cups:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about two-thirds full. This allows room for the muffins to rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Muffins</h2>

    <p>Baking gluten-free can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be well on your way to perfect muffins every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking and includes a mix of flours and starches.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough muffins. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add a Bit of Xanthan Gum:</strong> If your flour blend doesn’t already include it, adding a small amount of xanthan gum can help improve the texture of your muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Batter Rest:</strong> Allowing the batter to rest for 10-15 minutes before baking can help the flours hydrate and improve the final texture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>While almond flour can be used in gluten-free baking, it has a different texture and moisture content than a gluten-free flour blend. For the best results, stick to a blend designed for baking.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a non-dairy milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I add other flavors to these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Feel free to experiment with adding other flavors like vanilla extract, orange zest, or even a handful of blueberries for a twist on the classic recipe.</p>
