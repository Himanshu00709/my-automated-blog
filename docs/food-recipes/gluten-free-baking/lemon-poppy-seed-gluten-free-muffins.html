    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create your Lemon Poppy Seed Gluten-Free Muffins:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the almond flour, oat flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and then add the honey (or maple syrup), lemon zest, lemon juice, poppy seeds, vanilla extract, and almond milk. Mix until everything is well incorporated.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the Muffin Tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about ¾ full. This will allow the muffins to rise properly without overflowing.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Once baked, remove the muffins from the oven and let them cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Muffins</h2>

    <p>Baking gluten-free muffins can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to achieve perfect results every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh lemon zest and juice will give your muffins the best flavor. Avoid using bottled lemon juice if possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to dense muffins. Mix until just combined to ensure a light and airy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking your muffins a few minutes before the recommended baking time. A toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean when they’re done.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> These muffins can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze them and reheat as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. However, keep in mind that different flours have different absorption rates, so you may need to adjust the liquid ingredients accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins vegan?</h3>
        <p>To make these muffins vegan, you can substitute the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and use a plant-based sweetener like maple syrup instead of honey.</p>

        <h3>Are poppy seeds gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, poppy seeds are naturally gluten-free. However, always check the packaging to ensure they haven’t been processed in a facility that handles gluten-containing products.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other flavors to these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can add a teaspoon of cinnamon or a handful of blueberries to the batter for a different flavor profile. Just be mindful of the additional moisture that some add-ins might bring.</p>
