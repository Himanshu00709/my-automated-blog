    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with oil. This will ensure that your muffins don’t stick to the pan.</p>

    <h3>2. Mash the Bananas</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more flavorful your muffins will be. If you prefer a chunkier texture, you can leave some small banana pieces in the mix.</p>

    <h3>3. Mix Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add the peanut butter, eggs, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract to the mashed bananas. Mix well until all the ingredients are fully combined. The peanut butter will add a rich, nutty flavor and help bind the muffins together.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. This ensures that the leavening agents are evenly distributed throughout the flour, which is crucial for achieving the right texture.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins. If the batter seems too thick, you can add a splash of milk to achieve the desired consistency.</p>

    <h3>6. Fill the Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full. This allows room for the muffins to rise without overflowing.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the muffins in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The baking time may vary depending on your oven, so keep an eye on them after the 15-minute mark.</p>

    <h3>8. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can enjoy them as is or add a dollop of peanut butter on top for extra flavor.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>These banana peanut butter muffins are not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Bananas are a great source of potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure and support heart health. Peanut butter provides healthy fats and protein, making these muffins a satisfying snack that can keep you full for longer. Additionally, using gluten-free flour ensures that these muffins are suitable for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond butter instead of peanut butter?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond butter for peanut butter if you prefer. The flavor will be slightly different, but the muffins will still be delicious.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make these muffins vegan, you can replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and use a non-dairy milk alternative.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 3 months. Simply thaw them at room temperature or reheat them in the microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add chocolate chips to the batter?</h3>
        <p>Yes, adding chocolate chips is a great way to enhance the flavor of these muffins. Simply fold in ½ cup of chocolate chips into the batter before baking.</p>
