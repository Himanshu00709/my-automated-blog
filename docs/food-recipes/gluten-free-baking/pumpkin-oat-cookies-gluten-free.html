    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you’ve gathered your ingredients, let’s get baking! Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free pumpkin oat cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and make cleanup a breeze.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, maple syrup, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and well combined. The pumpkin puree adds moisture and a rich, autumnal flavor to the cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free rolled oats, gluten-free flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt. Stir until all the dry ingredients are evenly distributed. This ensures that every bite of your cookie is perfectly spiced and textured.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until a thick dough forms. If you’re using any optional add-ins like chocolate chips or nuts, fold them into the dough at this stage. The dough should be slightly sticky but manageable.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Shape and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a tablespoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Flatten each cookie slightly with the back of a spoon or your fingers. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The cookies will firm up as they cool, so don’t overbake them.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your gluten-free pumpkin oat cookies with a glass of milk or a cup of tea for the ultimate fall treat.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pumpkin Oat Cookies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular oats instead of gluten-free oats?</h3>
        <p>No, regular oats are often cross-contaminated with gluten during processing. To ensure your cookies are truly gluten-free, always use certified gluten-free oats.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I substitute the pumpkin puree with something else?</h3>
        <p>Pumpkin puree is essential for the flavor and texture of these cookies. However, you can experiment with sweet potato puree or butternut squash puree as alternatives.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>4. Are these cookies suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this recipe is vegan-friendly as long as you use maple syrup instead of honey and ensure your chocolate chips or other add-ins are vegan.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free pumpkin oat cookies are the perfect treat for anyone looking to enjoy the flavors of fall without compromising their dietary needs. With their wholesome ingredients and easy preparation, these cookies are sure to become a seasonal favorite. Whether you’re baking for yourself, your family, or a gathering of friends, these cookies are a delicious way to celebrate the season.
