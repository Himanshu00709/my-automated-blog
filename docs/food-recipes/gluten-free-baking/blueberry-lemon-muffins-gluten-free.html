    <h1>Blueberry Lemon Muffins: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

    <p>When it comes to breakfast or a mid-day snack, muffins are a classic choice. But for those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding the perfect muffin recipe can be a challenge.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free blueberry lemon muffins:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with butter or oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In another bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Flavorings:</strong> Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk. Mix until just combined—do not overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Blueberries:</strong> Gently fold in the fresh blueberries, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill Muffin Cups:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Muffins</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free muffins can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll achieve perfect results every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Good Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense muffins. Mix the batter until just combined to keep the texture light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Use fresh blueberries and freshly squeezed lemon juice for the best flavor. Frozen blueberries can be used, but they may bleed into the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Ensure your eggs and buttermilk are at room temperature to help the batter mix more evenly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries, but be sure to thaw and drain them well before adding to the batter. This will prevent excess moisture from affecting the texture of the muffins.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the butter with coconut oil and use almond milk or another non-dairy milk in place of buttermilk. The muffins will still turn out delicious.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, keep them in the refrigerator for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>
    </div>
