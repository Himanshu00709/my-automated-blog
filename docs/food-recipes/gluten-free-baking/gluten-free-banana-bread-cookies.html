<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free banana bread cookies:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li><strong>Mash the Bananas:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. The smoother the bananas, the more evenly they’ll mix with the other ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> Add the maple syrup, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract to the mashed bananas. Mix well until all the wet ingredients are fully incorporated.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, combine the almond flour, rolled oats, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until a thick dough forms.</li>
    <li><strong>Fold in Chocolate Chips:</strong> If you’re using chocolate chips, gently fold them into the dough at this stage. This step is optional but highly recommended for a touch of indulgence.</li>
    <li><strong>Shape the Cookies:</strong> Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Flatten each cookie slightly with the back of the spoon to ensure even baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are golden brown. Keep an eye on them to prevent over-baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free banana bread cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite tea!</li>
</ol>
