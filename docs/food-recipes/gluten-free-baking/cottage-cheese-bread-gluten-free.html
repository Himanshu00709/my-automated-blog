    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the recipe. Follow these simple steps to create your own gluten-free cottage cheese bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your bread bakes evenly and rises properly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cottage cheese, eggs, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix until all the ingredients are well incorporated. If you'd like to add some extra flavor, this is the time to mix in your favorite herbs or spices.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Pour the Batter into a Loaf Pan</h3>
    <p>Grease a loaf pan with a little oil or line it with parchment paper. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly with a spatula.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Bread</h3>
    <p>Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the bread is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing and serving.</p>
