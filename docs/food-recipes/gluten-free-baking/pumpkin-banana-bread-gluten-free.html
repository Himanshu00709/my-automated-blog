    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the baking process. Follow these step-by-step instructions to create your gluten-free pumpkin banana bread:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mash the bananas until smooth. Add the pumpkin puree, eggs, maple syrup, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Mix until everything is well incorporated.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense bread.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour the batter into the loaf pan:</strong> Transfer the batter into the prepared loaf pan, spreading it evenly with a spatula.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Once baked, remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing and serving.</li>
