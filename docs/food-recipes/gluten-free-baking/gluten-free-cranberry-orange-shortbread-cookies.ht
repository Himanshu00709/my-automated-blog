    <h1>Gluten-Free Cranberry Orange Shortbread Cookies: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Shortbread cookies are a classic treat that many of us grew up enjoying. Their buttery, crumbly texture and subtle sweetness make them a favorite for tea time, holiday gatherings, or just a simple snack. But what if you could elevate this classic cookie with a burst of citrusy orange and tart cranberries, all while keeping it gluten-free? That’s exactly what we’re diving into today with our recipe for Gluten-Free Cranberry Orange Shortbread Cookies.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Shortbread?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular, not just for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also for people looking to explore alternative flours and healthier baking options. Traditional shortbread cookies are made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, with the right combination of gluten-free flours, you can achieve the same tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture without compromising on taste.</p>

    <p>In this recipe, we’ll be using a blend of almond flour and rice flour to create a gluten-free base that’s both nutritious and delicious. Almond flour adds a rich, nutty flavor and a soft texture, while rice flour helps to bind the dough and give it that classic shortbread crunch.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2>

    <p>Before we get into the step-by-step instructions, let’s take a look at the ingredients you’ll need to make these delightful cookies:</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that we have all our ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making these gluten-free cranberry orange shortbread cookies:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer. Add the vanilla extract and orange zest, and mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Combine the Dry Ingredients</h3>

    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond flour, rice flour, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing on low speed until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cookies tough.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Cranberries</h3>

    <p>Fold in the chopped dried cranberries until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough. The cranberries will add a delightful tartness that complements the sweetness of the cookie.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Shape the Dough</h3>

    <p>Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap and shape it into a log about 2 inches in diameter. Wrap the log tightly in the plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or until firm. Chilling the dough is essential for achieving the perfect shortbread texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cookies</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Remove the dough from the refrigerator and slice it into ¼-inch thick rounds. Place the rounds on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, these cookies are ready to be enjoyed with a cup of tea or coffee!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh cranberries instead of dried?</h3>
        <p>While dried cranberries are recommended for this recipe, you can use fresh cranberries if you prefer. However, keep in mind that fresh cranberries have a higher moisture content, which may affect the texture of the cookies. If using fresh cranberries, consider reducing the amount slightly and chopping them finely.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I substitute the almond flour with another gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour is a key ingredient in this recipe, as it provides a rich, nutty flavor and a soft texture. If you need to substitute it, you can try using coconut flour, but keep in mind that coconut flour absorbs more moisture, so you may need to adjust the amount of butter or add an extra egg to the dough.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>These cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the baked cookies for up to 2 months. Simply thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>
    </div>
