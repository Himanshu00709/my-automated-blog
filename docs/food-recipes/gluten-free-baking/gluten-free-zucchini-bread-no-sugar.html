    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free zucchini bread:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Set your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a loaf pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the zucchini:</strong> Grate the zucchini and squeeze out excess moisture using a clean kitchen towel. This step ensures your bread isn’t soggy.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix wet ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, unsweetened applesauce, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Fold in the grated zucchini and any optional add-ins.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and enjoy!</li>
