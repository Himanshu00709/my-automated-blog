    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a loaf pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>

        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a smooth batter forms. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Cranberries:</strong> Gently fold the fresh cranberries into the batter, ensuring they are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
