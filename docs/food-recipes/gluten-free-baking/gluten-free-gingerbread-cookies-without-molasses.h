<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</p>

<h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, ground ginger, ground cinnamon, ground cloves, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>

<h3>3. Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

<h3>4. Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>Beat in the egg, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract until well combined. The mixture should be smooth and slightly sticky.</p>

<h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cookies tough.</p>

<h3>6. Shape the Dough</h3>
<p>Roll the dough into 1-inch balls and place them on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Flatten each ball slightly with the palm of your hand or the bottom of a glass.</p>

<h3>7. Bake the Cookies</h3>
<p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may still look soft, but they will firm up as the cookies cool.</p>

<h3>8. Cool and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can decorate them with icing or enjoy them as is.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different sweetener instead of honey or maple syrup?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute honey or maple syrup with other liquid sweeteners like agave nectar or even a sugar-free syrup if you prefer. Just keep in mind that the flavor and texture of the cookies may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best for this recipe?</h3>
    <p>A 1:1 gluten-free flour blend that includes xanthan gum works best for this recipe. Popular brands include Bob's Red Mill and King Arthur Flour. If your blend doesn't contain xanthan gum, you may need to add 1/2 teaspoon to the dry ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make these cookies vegan by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative like coconut oil or vegan margarine, and replacing the egg with a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water).</p>

    <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
    <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 3 months. Just make sure to thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>
