    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Lemon Poppy Seed Cake</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the recipe. Follow these steps to create a gluten-free lemon poppy seed cake that’s sure to impress:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with coconut oil and line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of almond flour, 1/4 cup of coconut flour, 2 tablespoons of poppy seeds, and a pinch of salt. Whisk these ingredients together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together 4 large eggs, 1/2 cup of melted coconut oil, 1/2 cup of honey or maple syrup, 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice, and the zest of 2 lemons. Mix until the ingredients are fully incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until a smooth batter forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can affect the texture of the cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Lemon Poppy Seed Cake</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free lemon poppy seed cake isn’t just delicious—it’s also packed with health benefits. Almond flour is rich in healthy fats, protein, and vitamin E, while coconut oil provides medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) that are easily digested and provide quick energy. Poppy seeds are a good source of dietary fiber, calcium, and iron, making this cake a guilt-free indulgence.</p>
