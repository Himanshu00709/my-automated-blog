    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that we have all the ingredients ready, let's walk through the steps to create this delightful Lemon Blueberry Loaf.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with butter or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. Add the melted butter (or coconut oil), lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Mix until everything is well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense loaf.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fold in Blueberries</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the fresh blueberries into the batter. If you're using frozen blueberries, toss them in a bit of gluten-free flour before adding to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the loaf.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the loaf to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve with a cup of tea or coffee for a perfect treat.</p>
