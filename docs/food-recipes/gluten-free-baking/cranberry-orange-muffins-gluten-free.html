    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making these delightful muffins:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with butter or oil to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the batter.</p>

    <h3>3. Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the melted butter, orange zest, orange juice, and vanilla extract. Mix until everything is well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins. Fold in the fresh cranberries, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

    <h3>5. Fill the Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full. This allows room for the muffins to rise during baking.</p>

    <h3>6. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The tops should be golden brown and slightly springy to the touch.</p>

    <h3>7. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the muffins from the oven and let them cool in the tin for about 5 minutes. Transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely before serving. Enjoy your gluten-free cranberry orange muffins with a cup of tea or coffee for a perfect breakfast or snack.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use dried cranberries instead of fresh ones?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use dried cranberries if fresh ones are not available. However, keep in mind that dried cranberries are sweeter and may alter the tartness of the muffins. You may want to reduce the amount of sugar in the recipe if using dried cranberries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with coconut oil or any other dairy-free alternative. Just ensure that the oil is in a liquid state before mixing it into the batter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate them for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply microwave them for a few seconds or warm them in the oven.</p>
    </div>
