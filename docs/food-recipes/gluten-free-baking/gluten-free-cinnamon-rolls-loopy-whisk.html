<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Dough</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of the dry ingredients. In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract until the mixture is smooth.</p>

<h3>2. Rolling and Filling the Dough</h3>

<p>Once the dough is ready, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface (using gluten-free flour, of course). Roll the dough into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar and ground cinnamon. Spread this mixture evenly over the rolled-out dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Carefully roll the dough into a tight log, starting from one of the longer sides.</p>

<h3>3. Cutting and Baking</h3>

<p>Using a sharp knife, cut the log into 12 equal slices. Place the slices in a greased baking dish, leaving a little space between each roll to allow for expansion. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the rolls are golden brown and cooked through.</p>

<h3>4. Making the Frosting</h3>

<p>While the cinnamon rolls are baking, prepare the cream cheese frosting. In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar, mixing until well combined. Add the milk, one tablespoon at a time, until the frosting reaches your desired consistency. Once the cinnamon rolls are out of the oven and slightly cooled, spread the frosting generously over the top.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make these cinnamon rolls dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can easily make these cinnamon rolls dairy-free by substituting the butter with a dairy-free alternative (such as coconut oil or vegan butter) and using a non-dairy milk (like almond or oat milk). For the frosting, you can use a dairy-free cream cheese substitute.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze these cinnamon rolls?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! These cinnamon rolls freeze well. Once baked and cooled, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe container. To reheat, simply thaw at room temperature and warm in the oven or microwave.</p>

    <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best?</h3>
    <p>Loopy Whisk recommends using a gluten-free flour blend that contains a mix of rice flour, potato starch, and tapioca starch. However, you can use any high-quality gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. Just make sure it includes xanthan gum or add it separately as directed in the recipe.</p>

With their soft, fluffy texture and rich, gooey filling, these rolls are sure to become a favorite in your household. Whether you're gluten-free by necessity or by choice, this recipe proves that you don't have to sacrifice flavor or texture when baking without gluten.
