    <h1>Gluten-Free Banana Nut Muffins: A Healthy Delight</h1>

    <p>Banana nut muffins are a classic treat that many of us grew up enjoying. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional muffins can be off-limits. Fortunately, gluten-free baking has come a long way, and today, we’re diving into the world of gluten-free banana nut muffins. These muffins are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients, making them a perfect breakfast or snack option for anyone looking to maintain a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Banana Nut Muffins?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free banana nut muffins are an excellent choice for several reasons. First and foremost, they cater to individuals who need to avoid gluten due to health reasons. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and other health problems for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. By opting for gluten-free muffins, you can enjoy a tasty treat without the worry of adverse reactions.</p>

    <p>Additionally, gluten-free banana nut muffins can be a healthier option for everyone. They are often made with nutrient-dense ingredients like almond flour, oats, and coconut flour, which provide more fiber, protein, and healthy fats compared to traditional wheat flour. The bananas add natural sweetness and moisture, reducing the need for excessive sugar, while the nuts contribute healthy fats and a satisfying crunch.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the process of making these delicious gluten-free banana nut muffins:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash the bananas:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more flavorful your muffins will be.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix wet ingredients:</strong> Add the eggs, almond milk, melted coconut oil, maple syrup (or honey), and vanilla extract to the mashed bananas. Whisk everything together until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. This ensures that the leavening agents are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the nuts:</strong> Gently fold in the chopped nuts, reserving a few for topping the muffins if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the muffin tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full. Sprinkle the reserved nuts on top for added crunch.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the muffins in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy warm or at room temperature!</li>
    </ol>
