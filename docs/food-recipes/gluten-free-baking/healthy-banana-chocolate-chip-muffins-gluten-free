    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free banana chocolate chip muffins:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with coconut oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash the bananas:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. The smoother the bananas, the more evenly they will distribute throughout the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, combine the almond flour, gluten-free oats, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir until well mixed.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> To the mashed bananas, add the eggs, honey (or maple syrup), melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Add chocolate chips:</strong> Fold in the dark chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the muffin tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

Almond flour is a great source of healthy fats, protein, and vitamin E, while oats provide fiber and help keep you full longer. Bananas add natural sweetness and are rich in potassium, which supports heart health. Dark chocolate chips, especially those with a high cocoa content, are a good source of antioxidants. Together, these ingredients make for a wholesome and satisfying snack.</p>
