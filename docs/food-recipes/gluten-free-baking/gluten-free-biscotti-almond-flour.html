    <h1>Gluten-Free Biscotti with Almond Flour: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>Biscotti, the classic Italian twice-baked cookie, has been a beloved treat for centuries. Traditionally made with wheat flour, biscotti are known for their crunchy texture and versatility, often paired with coffee or tea. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying traditional biscotti can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free biscotti made with almond flour—a delicious and healthy alternative that doesn’t compromise on taste or texture. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of almond flour, how to make gluten-free biscotti, and why this treat is a must-try for anyone looking to enjoy a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Almond Flour for Gluten-Free Biscotti?</h2>

    <p>Almond flour is a popular choice for gluten-free baking, and for good reason. Made from finely ground almonds, this flour is naturally gluten-free, low in carbohydrates, and high in healthy fats, protein, and fiber. Unlike traditional wheat flour, almond flour adds a rich, nutty flavor to baked goods, making it an excellent choice for biscotti. Additionally, almond flour provides a moist and tender crumb, which helps prevent the dryness often associated with gluten-free baking.</p>

    <p>Here are some key benefits of using almond flour in your gluten-free biscotti:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nutrient-Dense:</strong> Almond flour is packed with essential nutrients, including vitamin E, magnesium, and healthy fats, making it a healthier alternative to refined flours.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Glycemic Index:</strong> Almond flour has a low glycemic index, which means it won’t cause a rapid spike in blood sugar levels, making it suitable for those managing diabetes or insulin resistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free:</strong> Naturally free from gluten, almond flour is safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich Flavor:</strong> The nutty flavor of almond flour enhances the taste of biscotti, adding depth and complexity to the final product.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. If using add-ins, fold them into the dough at this stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Divide the dough in half and shape each portion into a log about 12 inches long and 2 inches wide. Place the logs on the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between them.</li>
        <li><strong>First Bake:</strong> Bake the logs for 25-30 minutes, or until they are firm to the touch and lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Slice the Biscotti:</strong> Using a sharp knife, slice the logs diagonally into 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange the slices cut-side down on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Bake:</strong> Bake the slices for an additional 10-15 minutes, flipping halfway through, until they are crisp and golden. Allow the biscotti to cool completely before serving.</li>
    </ol>
