    <h1>Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Muffins: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>For those who love baked goods but need to avoid gluten, gluten-free chocolate chip muffins are a delightful solution. These muffins are not only delicious but also cater to dietary restrictions, making them a perfect treat for everyone.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free chocolate chip muffins:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream butter and sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream the softened butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the muffins dense.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in chocolate chips:</strong> Gently fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill muffin cups:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Muffins</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free muffins can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough muffins. Mix until just combined to keep them light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Gluten-free baked goods can sometimes take longer to bake. Use a toothpick to check if the muffins are done.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with add-ins:</strong> Feel free to add nuts, dried fruit, or other mix-ins to customize your muffins.</li>
    </ul>
