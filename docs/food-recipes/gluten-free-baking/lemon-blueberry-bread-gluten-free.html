    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Lemon Blueberry Bread?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among health-conscious individuals.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free lemon blueberry bread:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan and line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Ensure there are no lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, sugar, eggs, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in blueberries:</strong> Gently fold the fresh blueberries into the batter. If using frozen blueberries, toss them in a little gluten-free flour before adding to prevent them from sinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Lemon Blueberry Bread</h2>
    <p>Here are some expert tips to ensure your bread turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps to mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense and tough loaf. Mix until just combined to keep the bread light and tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a less sweet bread, you can reduce the amount of sugar. Alternatively, you can add a little more lemon zest for a tangier flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> To keep your bread fresh, store it in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries. However, it's a good idea to toss them in a little gluten-free flour before adding them to the batter to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the loaf.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this bread dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or a plant-based butter. Just ensure that the substitute is in a similar state (melted and cooled) for the best results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I know when the bread is done baking?</h3>
        <p>The bread is done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with just a few crumbs attached. If the top is browning too quickly, you can cover it loosely with aluminum foil for the last 10-15 minutes of baking.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free lemon blueberry bread is a delightful treat that combines the bright, tangy flavors of lemon with the sweet, juicy burst of blueberries. With the right ingredients and techniques, you can create a moist and flavorful loaf that everyone will love, regardless of dietary restrictions. Whether you're new to gluten-free baking or a seasoned pro, this recipe is sure to become a staple in your kitchen.
