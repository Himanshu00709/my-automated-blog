    <h1>Gluten-Free Chocolate Cookies with Almond Flour: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>In recent years, gluten-free diets have gained immense popularity, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also among health-conscious individuals looking to reduce their gluten intake. One of the most beloved gluten-free treats is the chocolate cookie, and when made with almond flour, it becomes a nutritious and delicious option. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of using almond flour, provide a detailed recipe, and answer some frequently asked questions about gluten-free baking.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Almond Flour for Gluten-Free Baking?</h2>
    <p>Almond flour is a fantastic alternative to traditional wheat flour for several reasons.

Unlike refined flours, almond flour has a low glycemic index, meaning it won’t cause a rapid spike in blood sugar levels. Additionally, almond flour adds a rich, nutty flavor to baked goods, enhancing the overall taste of your cookies.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free chocolate cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the melted coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until a thick dough forms. Fold in the dark chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the cookies:</strong> Scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of dough and roll them into balls. Place them on the prepared baking sheet and gently flatten them with your hand or a fork.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft. Allow them to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
