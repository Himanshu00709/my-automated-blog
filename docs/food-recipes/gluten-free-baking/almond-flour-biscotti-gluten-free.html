<h1>Almond Flour Biscotti: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

<p>Biscotti, the classic Italian twice-baked cookie, has been a favorite for centuries. Traditionally made with wheat flour, biscotti are known for their crunchy texture and versatility. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying this treat can be a challenge. Enter almond flour biscotti—a delicious, gluten-free alternative that retains all the charm of the original. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of almond flour, how to make gluten-free biscotti, and why this recipe is a must-try for anyone looking to indulge without compromising their dietary needs.</p>

<h2>Why Almond Flour?</h2>

<p>Almond flour is a popular choice for gluten-free baking, and for good reason. Made from finely ground almonds, it’s naturally gluten-free and packed with nutrients. Unlike traditional wheat flour, almond flour is rich in healthy fats, protein, and fiber, making it a more nutritious option. It also has a slightly sweet, nutty flavor that pairs perfectly with the crunchy texture of biscotti. Additionally, almond flour is low in carbohydrates, making it a great choice for those following a low-carb or keto diet.</p>

<p>Another advantage of almond flour is its versatility. It can be used in a variety of baked goods, from cookies to cakes, and it provides a moist, tender crumb that’s hard to achieve with other gluten-free flours. When it comes to biscotti, almond flour’s natural density helps create the perfect crunchy texture that’s essential for this classic treat.</p>

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Almond Flour Biscotti</h2>

<p>Making almond flour biscotti is surprisingly simple, and the results are just as satisfying as the traditional version. Below is a step-by-step guide to creating your own gluten-free biscotti at home.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine the wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a dough forms. If using add-ins, fold them into the dough at this stage.</li>
    <li><strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet and shape it into a log, about 12 inches long and 3 inches wide.</li>
    <li><strong>First bake:</strong> Bake the dough for 25-30 minutes, or until it is firm to the touch and lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Slice the biscotti:</strong> Using a sharp knife, slice the log diagonally into 1/2-inch thick slices.</li>
    <li><strong>Second bake:</strong> Place the slices cut-side down on the baking sheet and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the biscotti are crisp and golden.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the biscotti to cool completely before serving. Store in an airtight container for up to two weeks.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Almond Flour Biscotti</h2>

<p>While the recipe above is straightforward, here are a few tips to ensure your almond flour biscotti turn out perfectly every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use blanched almond flour:</strong> Blanched almond flour, which is made from almonds without their skins, will give your biscotti a finer texture and lighter color.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense biscotti. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the dough rest:</strong> Allowing the dough to rest for 10-15 minutes before shaping can make it easier to handle.</li>
    <li><strong>Slice carefully:</strong> Use a sharp serrated knife to slice the biscotti after the first bake. This will help prevent crumbling.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Almond flour biscotti are incredibly versatile. Try adding different flavors like lemon zest, cinnamon, or even a drizzle of dark chocolate for a unique twist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Almond Flour Biscotti</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use other gluten-free flours instead of almond flour?</h3>

    <h3>2. Are almond flour biscotti keto-friendly?</h3>
    <p>Yes, almond flour biscotti can be keto-friendly, especially if you use a low-carb sweetener like erythritol instead of sugar. Just be mindful of any add-ins that may increase the carb count.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I make almond flour biscotti without eggs?</h3>
