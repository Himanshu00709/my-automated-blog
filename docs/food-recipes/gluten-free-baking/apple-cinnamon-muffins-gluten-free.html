    <h1>Gluten-Free Apple Cinnamon Muffins: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>When it comes to baking, few combinations are as comforting and satisfying as apple and cinnamon. These flavors evoke memories of cozy autumn mornings and warm, freshly baked treats. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding the perfect muffin recipe can be a challenge.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free apple cinnamon muffins:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, coconut flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then add the honey (or maple syrup), applesauce, and vanilla extract. Mix until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the apples:</strong> Gently fold the diced apples into the batter, ensuring they are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the muffin tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Muffins</h2>

    <p>Baking gluten-free muffins can be a bit different from traditional baking, but with these tips, you’ll achieve perfect results every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a blend of flours:</strong> Combining almond flour and coconut flour helps create a balanced texture. Almond flour provides moisture, while coconut flour adds structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense muffins. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add moisture:</strong> Gluten-free baked goods can sometimes be dry. Using ingredients like applesauce or yogurt can help keep your muffins moist.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with sweeteners:</strong> If you prefer a less sweet muffin, you can reduce the amount of honey or maple syrup, or use a sugar substitute like stevia.</li>
    </ul>
