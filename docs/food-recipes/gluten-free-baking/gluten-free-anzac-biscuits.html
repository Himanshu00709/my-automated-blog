<h1>Gluten-Free Anzac Biscuits: A Delicious Twist on a Classic</h1>

<p>Anzac biscuits are a beloved treat with a rich history, originating from Australia and New Zealand. Traditionally made with rolled oats, flour, sugar, butter, golden syrup, and baking soda, these biscuits are known for their chewy texture and sweet, caramel-like flavor. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying these classic biscuits can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free Anzac biscuits—a delicious and inclusive twist on the traditional recipe that allows everyone to enjoy this iconic treat.</p>

<h2>The History of Anzac Biscuits</h2>

<p>Anzac biscuits have a storied past, deeply rooted in the history of Australia and New Zealand. The name "Anzac" stands for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, and these biscuits were originally sent to soldiers during World War I. The ingredients were chosen for their long shelf life, making them ideal for transportation to the front lines. Over time, Anzac biscuits have become a symbol of national pride and are often enjoyed on Anzac Day, a day of remembrance for those who served and died in all wars, conflicts, and peacekeeping operations.</p>

<h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals with gluten sensitivities or those simply looking to reduce their gluten intake. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause digestive issues and other health problems for some people. By making Anzac biscuits gluten-free, you can enjoy this classic treat without the worry of gluten-related discomfort.</p>
