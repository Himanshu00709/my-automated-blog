    <h1>Gluten-Free Apple and Cinnamon Muffins: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease the cups with a little butter or oil to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the batter.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream together the unsalted butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving a tender crumb in your muffins.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Then, mix in the unsweetened applesauce and milk. The applesauce adds moisture and a subtle apple flavor, while the milk helps to create a smooth batter.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins. Gently fold in the diced apples.</p>

    <h3>6. Fill Muffin Cups</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about two-thirds full. This allows room for the muffins to rise without overflowing.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The muffins should be golden brown and spring back when lightly touched.</p>

    <h3>8. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature, and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Muffins</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be able to achieve perfect muffins every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough muffins. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Xanthan Gum:</strong> If your gluten-free flour blend doesn't already contain xanthan gum, consider adding 1/2 teaspoon to help bind the ingredients and improve texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to add nuts, raisins, or even a streusel topping for extra flavor and texture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as almond flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. It's best to use a blend specifically designed for baking.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or margarine, and use a non-dairy milk like almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 3 months. Just thaw and reheat before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I reduce the sugar in this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup if you prefer a less sweet muffin. The applesauce and diced apples will still provide natural sweetness.</p>
    </div>
