    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the milk, stirring until a soft dough forms. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

    <h3>2. Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>On a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour), roll out the dough into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. If the dough is sticky, you can place it between two sheets of parchment paper to make rolling easier.</p>

    <h3>3. Add the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar and ground cinnamon. Spread this mixture evenly over the rolled-out dough, leaving a small border around the edges. If you like, you can also add a drizzle of melted butter over the sugar mixture for extra richness.</p>

    <h3>4. Roll and Cut</h3>
    <p>Starting from one of the longer sides, tightly roll the dough into a log. Use a sharp knife or a piece of dental floss to cut the log into 8-10 equal slices. Place the slices cut-side up in a greased baking dish, leaving a little space between each roll.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the cinnamon rolls in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. While the rolls are baking, you can prepare the cream cheese frosting.</p>

    <h3>6. Make the Frosting</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract, mixing until the frosting is creamy and well combined. Once the cinnamon rolls are out of the oven and slightly cooled, spread the frosting over the top.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but keep in mind that the texture may vary. Almond flour or oat flour can be used, but they may require adjustments to the liquid content.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cinnamon rolls ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the rolls up to the point of baking, cover them tightly, and refrigerate overnight. Bake them in the morning for a fresh, warm breakfast.</p>

        <h3>Are these cinnamon rolls dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can be made dairy-free by using a dairy-free butter substitute and a non-dairy milk alternative. For the frosting, you can use a dairy-free cream cheese substitute.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover cinnamon rolls?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover cinnamon rolls in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them and reheat in the oven when ready to eat.</p>
