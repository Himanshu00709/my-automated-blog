    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly. This ensures your muffins won't stick and will come out perfectly shaped.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together 2 cups of gluten-free flour blend, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice. This blend of spices will give your muffins that quintessential fall flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In another bowl, mix 1 cup of pumpkin puree, 1/2 cup of maple syrup or honey, 1/4 cup of melted coconut oil, and 2 large eggs. Whisk until smooth and well combined. The pumpkin puree adds moisture, while the maple syrup provides natural sweetness.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense muffins. The batter should be thick but pourable.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Prepare the Cream Cheese Swirl</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix 4 ounces of softened cream cheese with 2 tablespoons of maple syrup or honey until smooth. This will create the creamy swirl that tops each muffin.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Scoop the muffin batter into the prepared tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full. Add a dollop of the cream cheese mixture on top of each muffin and use a toothpick to swirl it into the batter. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature, and enjoy the perfect balance of pumpkin and cream cheese in every bite.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned puree?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer fresh pumpkin, simply roast and puree it before using it in the recipe. Just make sure it has a similar consistency to canned puree.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the cream cheese with a dairy-free alternative, such as vegan cream cheese, and use a plant-based milk if needed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months.</p>
    </div>
