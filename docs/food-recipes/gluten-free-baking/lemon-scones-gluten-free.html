    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free lemon scones is easier than you might think. Follow these steps for perfect scones every time:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut in the butter:</strong> Add the cold butter to the dry ingredients and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut it into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Add wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, egg, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a few times. Pat it into a circle about 1 inch thick, then cut it into 8 wedges.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the scones to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy them plain or with a dollop of clotted cream and your favorite jam.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Scones</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free scones can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to achieve the perfect texture and flavor:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep your butter cold:</strong> Cold butter is key to achieving flaky scones. If the butter melts before baking, your scones will be dense rather than light and crumbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough scones. Mix the dough just until it comes together, then stop.</li>
        <li><strong>Add extra lemon flavor:</strong> If you love a strong lemon flavor, consider adding a bit of lemon extract or extra lemon zest to the dough.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Lemon Scones</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these scones dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make dairy-free lemon scones by substituting the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and using a non-dairy milk or cream in place of heavy cream.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free lemon scones?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free scones are best enjoyed fresh, but they can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, freeze the scones and reheat them in the oven when ready to eat.</p>

        <p>Absolutely! While lemon is the star of this recipe, you can add other flavors like blueberries, raspberries, or even a touch of vanilla extract to customize your scones.</p>
