    <h1>Gluten-Free Zucchini Blueberry Bread: A Healthy Delight</h1>
    <p>In the world of gluten-free baking, finding a recipe that is both delicious and nutritious can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free zucchini blueberry bread—a moist, flavorful, and health-conscious treat that combines the natural sweetness of blueberries with the subtle earthiness of zucchini. This bread is perfect for breakfast, a midday snack, or even dessert. Whether you're gluten-intolerant or simply looking to incorporate more vegetables into your diet, this recipe is a must-try.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Zucchini Blueberry Bread?</h2>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free zucchini blueberry bread:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, beat the eggs, then add the honey (or maple syrup), applesauce, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Avoid overmixing.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Zucchini and Blueberries:</strong> Fold in the grated zucchini and blueberries gently. If using frozen blueberries, toss them in a tablespoon of gluten-free flour to prevent sinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free zucchini blueberry bread is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Zucchini:</strong> Low in calories and high in fiber, zucchini supports digestion and provides essential vitamins like vitamin C and vitamin A.</li>
        <li><strong>Blueberries:</strong> Known as a superfood, blueberries are rich in antioxidants, which help combat oxidative stress and inflammation.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Flour:</strong> Ideal for those with gluten intolerance, gluten-free flours like almond or oat flour add protein and healthy fats.</li>
        <li><strong>Natural Sweeteners:</strong> Using honey or maple syrup instead of refined sugar provides a healthier alternative while adding a touch of natural sweetness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, almond flour can be used, but it will change the texture of the bread. Almond flour tends to make baked goods denser, so you may need to adjust the baking time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I substitute the eggs for a vegan option?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can use flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) or chia eggs as a vegan alternative.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or refrigerate for up to a week. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>
    </div>
