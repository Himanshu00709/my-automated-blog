    <h1>Gluten-Free BBQ Side Dishes: A Complete Guide</h1>
    <p>Barbecues are a staple of summer gatherings, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding the right side dishes can be a challenge.

This guide will walk you through some of the best gluten-free options, from classic favorites to innovative new recipes.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free BBQ Side Dishes Matter</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health problems. Even if you don’t have a gluten intolerance, incorporating gluten-free options into your BBQ menu can make your gathering more inclusive and enjoyable for everyone.</p>

    <h2>Top Gluten-Free BBQ Side Dishes</h2>

    <h3>1. Grilled Corn on the Cob</h3>
    <p>Grilled corn on the cob is a classic BBQ side that’s naturally gluten-free. Simply brush the corn with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and grill until tender. For added flavor, try brushing the corn with a mixture of melted butter, lime juice, and chili powder.</p>

    <h3>2. Quinoa Salad</h3>
    <p>Quinoa is a versatile and nutritious grain that’s naturally gluten-free. A quinoa salad with fresh vegetables, herbs, and a tangy vinaigrette makes a refreshing side dish. Add some diced cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, and a squeeze of lemon juice for a bright and flavorful salad.</p>

    <h3>3. Sweet Potato Fries</h3>
    <p>Sweet potato fries are a healthier alternative to traditional fries and are naturally gluten-free. Slice sweet potatoes into thin strips, toss with olive oil, and bake until crispy. Serve with a gluten-free dipping sauce like aioli or ketchup.</p>

    <h3>4. Coleslaw</h3>
    <p>Coleslaw is a BBQ staple that can easily be made gluten-free. Use a gluten-free mayonnaise and check the labels on any pre-packaged ingredients to ensure they’re free of gluten. Add shredded cabbage, carrots, and a tangy dressing for a crunchy and refreshing side dish.</p>

    <h3>5. Grilled Vegetables</h3>
