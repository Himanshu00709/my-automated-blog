    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Fajita Marinade</h2>
    <p>Now that you know the key ingredients, let’s dive into the process of making your own gluten-free fajita marinade. Follow these simple steps to create a marinade that’s bursting with flavor:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Before you start, make sure you have all the necessary ingredients on hand. This includes fresh lime juice, olive oil, minced garlic, ground cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. If you’re using pre-packaged spices, double-check the labels to ensure they’re certified gluten-free.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, combine 1/4 cup of lime juice, 1/4 cup of olive oil, 3 cloves of minced garlic, 1 teaspoon of ground cumin, 1 teaspoon of chili powder, 1 teaspoon of paprika, and salt and pepper to taste. Whisk the ingredients together until well combined. The marinade should have a smooth, slightly thick consistency.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Marinate Your Protein or Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Place your choice of protein (chicken, beef, or tofu) or vegetables in a large resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the top, making sure everything is evenly coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours for deeper flavor penetration.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once marinated, cook your fajitas as desired—whether on the grill, in a skillet, or in the oven. Serve with gluten-free tortillas, fresh salsa, guacamole, and your favorite toppings for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fajita Marinade</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>While fresh lime juice is preferred for its bright, zesty flavor, you can use bottled lime juice in a pinch. Just make sure it’s 100% lime juice with no added preservatives or gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

        <h3>2. How long can I store the marinade?</h3>
        <p>The marinade can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. If you plan to store it longer, consider freezing it in ice cube trays for easy portioning.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I use this marinade for other dishes?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This gluten-free fajita marinade is versatile and can be used for grilling, roasting, or sautéing a variety of proteins and vegetables. It’s also great as a salad dressing or dipping sauce.</p>

        <h3>4. Is this marinade suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this marinade is vegan-friendly as it contains no animal products. It’s perfect for marinating tofu, tempeh, or a medley of vegetables.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
