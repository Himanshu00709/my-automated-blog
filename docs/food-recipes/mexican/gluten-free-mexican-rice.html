    <h1>Gluten-Free Mexican Rice: A Flavorful and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>Mexican rice, also known as "arroz rojo," is a staple in Mexican cuisine. It's a vibrant, flavorful dish that complements a variety of meals, from tacos to enchiladas. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional recipes can be problematic due to the use of certain ingredients that contain gluten. Fortunately, gluten-free Mexican rice is not only possible but also delicious and easy to prepare. In this article, we'll explore the ins and outs of making gluten-free Mexican rice, including tips, recipes, and nutritional benefits.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Traditional Mexican Rice Non-Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Traditional Mexican rice recipes often include ingredients like chicken broth or bouillon, which can contain gluten. Additionally, some brands of tomato sauce or paste may also have hidden gluten. Cross-contamination during preparation is another concern, especially if the rice is cooked in a kitchen where gluten-containing foods are prepared. For those who need to avoid gluten, it's essential to carefully select ingredients and follow safe cooking practices.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Mexican Rice</h2>
    <p>To make gluten-free Mexican rice, you'll need the following ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil or avocado oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce (ensure it's gluten-free)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create a delicious batch of gluten-free Mexican rice:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Rinse the Rice:</strong> Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming sticky.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Aromatics:</strong> In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until they become translucent and fragrant.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast the Rice:</strong> Add the rinsed rice to the skillet and toast it for a few minutes, stirring frequently. This step enhances the nutty flavor of the rice.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Spices:</strong> Stir in the cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix well to coat the rice evenly with the spices.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate the Tomato Sauce:</strong> Pour in the tomato sauce and stir until the rice is well-coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Broth:</strong> Pour in the gluten-free chicken or vegetable broth. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li><strong>Fluff and Serve:</strong> Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork and garnish with fresh cilantro if desired. Serve hot alongside your favorite Mexican dishes.</li>
    </ol>
