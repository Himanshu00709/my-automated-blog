    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Vegan Drop Biscuits</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create delicious gluten-free vegan drop biscuits:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of gluten-free flour blend, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1 tablespoon of flaxseed meal. Whisk until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add 1/2 cup of cold vegan butter or oil to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the fat into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Then, pour in 3/4 cup of plant-based milk and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Drop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop portions of the dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the biscuits to cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet before transferring them to a wire rack. Serve warm with your favorite toppings or as a side dish.</p>
