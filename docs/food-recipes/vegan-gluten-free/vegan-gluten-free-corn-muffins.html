    <h1>Vegan Gluten-Free Corn Muffins: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>Corn muffins are a classic comfort food, often enjoyed as a side dish or a quick snack.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Follow these steps to create your own vegan gluten-free corn muffins:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or lightly grease it with coconut oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the almond milk and apple cider vinegar. Let it sit for a few minutes to curdle, creating a buttermilk-like consistency. Then, add the maple syrup, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill Muffin Tin:</strong> Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
