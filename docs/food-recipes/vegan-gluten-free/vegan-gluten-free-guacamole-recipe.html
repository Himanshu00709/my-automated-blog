    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to make the perfect vegan and gluten-free guacamole:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Avocados:</strong> Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a medium-sized bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash the Avocados:</strong> Use a fork or potato masher to mash the avocados to your desired consistency. Some people prefer a chunky guacamole, while others like it smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Lime Juice:</strong> Add the freshly squeezed lime juice to the mashed avocados. The lime juice not only adds flavor but also helps prevent the avocados from browning.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix in the Vegetables:</strong> Add the finely chopped red onion, diced tomato, minced garlic, and minced jalapeño to the bowl. If you're using cilantro, add it now as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Season:</strong> Sprinkle in the salt and black pepper. Mix everything together until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Taste and Adjust:</strong> Taste your guacamole and adjust the seasoning if necessary. You can add more lime juice, salt, or pepper to suit your taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve immediately with your favorite gluten-free chips, vegetable sticks, or as a topping for tacos, salads, or bowls.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Guacamole</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your guacamole turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Ripe Avocados:</strong> The key to great guacamole is using ripe avocados. They should be slightly soft to the touch but not mushy.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Always use fresh ingredients, especially the lime juice and garlic. Fresh ingredients will give your guacamole the best flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust to Taste:</strong> Guacamole is very forgiving, so feel free to adjust the ingredients to suit your taste. If you like it spicier, add more jalapeño. If you prefer it tangier, add more lime juice.</li>
        <li><strong>Prevent Browning:</strong> To prevent your guacamole from browning, press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the guacamole before storing it in the fridge. This will limit its exposure to air.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make guacamole ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make guacamole ahead of time, but it's best to consume it within a day or two. To prevent browning, press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the guacamole before storing it in the fridge.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze guacamole?</h3>
        <p>Freezing guacamole is not recommended as the texture of the avocados will change once thawed. It's best to enjoy guacamole fresh.</p>

        <h3>What can I serve with guacamole?</h3>
        <p>Guacamole is incredibly versatile. You can serve it with gluten-free tortilla chips, vegetable sticks, or use it as a topping for tacos, salads, or bowls.</p>

        <h3>Is guacamole healthy?</h3>
        <p>Yes, guacamole is healthy! Avocados are rich in healthy fats, fiber, and various vitamins and minerals. Just be mindful of portion sizes, as avocados are calorie-dense.</p>
