    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Gluten-Free Pasta</h3>
    <p>Begin by cooking the gluten-free pasta according to the package instructions. Be sure to cook it al dente, as it will continue to soften when baked. Once cooked, drain the pasta and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Dairy-Free Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large saucepan, melt the dairy-free butter over medium heat. Add the gluten-free flour and whisk continuously to create a roux. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the mixture is lightly golden. Gradually pour in the dairy-free milk and vegetable broth, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook until it thickens, about 5-7 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Once the sauce has thickened, stir in the dairy-free cream cheese, Dijon mustard, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Mix until the cream cheese is fully incorporated and the sauce is smooth. Add the cooked turkey and gluten-free pasta to the sauce, stirring to ensure everything is well-coated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Tetrazzini</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish and spread it evenly. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Sprinkle the freshly chopped parsley over the top of the baked Tetrazzini for a pop of color and freshness. Serve warm and enjoy!</p>

        <h3>Can I use chicken instead of turkey?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily substitute turkey with cooked chicken in this recipe. Both proteins work well and provide a similar texture and flavor.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of dairy-free cream cheese?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have dairy-free cream cheese, you can use a dairy-free sour cream or a cashew-based cream sauce as a substitute. Both options will provide a creamy texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the Tetrazzini up to the baking step, cover it, and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours. When you’re ready to serve, simply bake it as directed, adding a few extra minutes if needed.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>While this recipe is dairy-free and gluten-free, it does contain turkey, which is not vegan. However, you can make a vegan version by substituting the turkey with plant-based protein like tofu or tempeh.</p>
