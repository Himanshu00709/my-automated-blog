    <h1>Gluten-Free Cinnamon Raisin Muffins: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance but also among health-conscious individuals looking to reduce their gluten intake. One of the most beloved gluten-free treats is the cinnamon raisin muffin. These muffins are not only delicious but also packed with wholesome ingredients that make them a perfect breakfast or snack option. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free baking, provide a detailed recipe for gluten-free cinnamon raisin muffins, and answer some frequently asked questions about gluten-free diets.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe digestive issues and long-term health problems. Even for those without celiac disease, gluten sensitivity can cause discomfort, bloating, and fatigue. By choosing gluten-free options, you can enjoy your favorite baked goods without the negative side effects.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free baking often incorporates nutrient-dense flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or oat flour, which can add extra fiber, protein, and healthy fats to your diet. These flours also tend to have a lower glycemic index, making them a better choice for maintaining stable blood sugar levels.</p>
