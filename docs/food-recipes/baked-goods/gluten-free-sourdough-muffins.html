    <h1>Gluten-Free Sourdough Muffins: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>In recent years, gluten-free diets have gained immense popularity, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also among health-conscious individuals. One of the challenges of a gluten-free lifestyle is finding baked goods that are both delicious and nutritious. Enter gluten-free sourdough muffins—a perfect blend of flavor, texture, and health benefits. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free sourdough muffins, from their health benefits to how you can make them at home.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Sourdough Muffins?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free sourdough muffins are a delightful twist on traditional muffins. They are made using gluten-free flours and a sourdough starter, which is a fermented mixture of flour and water. The sourdough process not only enhances the flavor but also improves the digestibility of the muffins. These muffins are perfect for anyone looking to enjoy a tasty treat without the gluten.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Sourdough Muffins</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free sourdough muffins offer several health benefits, making them a great addition to your diet:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Digestion:</strong> The fermentation process breaks down gluten and other hard-to-digest proteins, making the muffins easier on your stomach.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich in Nutrients:</strong> Sourdough fermentation increases the bioavailability of nutrients, making them more accessible to your body.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Glycemic Index:</strong> The slow fermentation process results in a lower glycemic index, which helps in maintaining stable blood sugar levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Gut Health:</strong> The probiotics produced during fermentation promote a healthy gut microbiome.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Sourdough Muffins</h2>

    </table>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Batter:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, sourdough starter, eggs, milk, honey, baking powder, salt, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined. If you’re using add-ins like berries or nuts, fold them into the batter gently.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Batter Rest:</strong> Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the batter rest for 30 minutes. This allows the sourdough to work its magic and develop flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> While the batter is resting, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the Muffin Tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 2/3 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Remove the muffins from the oven and let them cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
