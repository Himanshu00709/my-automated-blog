    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by activating the yeast. In a small bowl, combine the warm milk (around 110°F) with a teaspoon of sugar and the yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, pumpkin puree, melted butter, egg, salt, and the remaining sugar. Add the activated yeast mixture and mix until a dough forms. The dough should be soft but not sticky. If it's too sticky, add a bit more flour.</p>

    <h3>2. Let the Dough Rise</h3>

    <p>Once the dough is ready, cover it with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size. This step is crucial for achieving light and fluffy cinnamon rolls.</p>

    <h3>3. Roll Out the Dough</h3>

    <p>After the dough has risen, roll it out on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread a thin layer of melted butter over the dough, then sprinkle with a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon. You can also add a handful of chopped nuts or raisins if you like.</p>

    <h3>4. Roll and Cut</h3>

    <p>Starting from one of the longer sides, tightly roll the dough into a log. Use a sharp knife or a piece of dental floss to cut the log into 12 equal pieces. Place the rolls in a greased baking dish, leaving a little space between each one to allow for rising.</p>

    <h3>5. Second Rise</h3>

    <p>Cover the rolls with a kitchen towel and let them rise for another 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</p>

    <h3>6. Bake</h3>

    <p>Once the rolls have risen, bake them in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. While the rolls are baking, prepare the cream cheese frosting by mixing the cream cheese, powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth.</p>

    <h3>7. Frost and Serve</h3>

    <p>Once the rolls are out of the oven, let them cool for a few minutes before spreading the cream cheese frosting over the top. Serve warm and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. Just make sure it's a blend that's suitable for baking, as some gluten-free flours can be too dense or gritty for this type of recipe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these rolls ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the rolls up to the point of the second rise, then cover them and refrigerate overnight. In the morning, let them come to room temperature and finish rising before baking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I freeze these cinnamon rolls?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked rolls (without frosting) for up to 3 months. When you're ready to enjoy them, simply thaw at room temperature and warm them in the oven before adding the frosting.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <p>Gluten-free pumpkin cinnamon rolls are a delightful way to celebrate the flavors of fall. With their soft, fluffy texture and warm, spiced filling, they're sure to become a seasonal favorite. Whether you're baking for a special occasion or just want to treat yourself, these rolls are a must-try. So, roll up your sleeves, gather your ingredients, and get ready to enjoy the cozy, comforting taste of fall in every bite.</p>
