    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with butter or oil to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that these ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in your batter.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream together the unsalted butter (or coconut oil) and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving a tender crumb in your muffins.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Then, mix in the orange zest, freshly squeezed orange juice, and plain yogurt. The yogurt adds moisture and helps to create a soft texture in the muffins.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense muffins. Gently fold in the cranberries, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

    <h3>6. Fill Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full. This allows room for the muffins to rise without overflowing.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Bake the muffins in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The tops should be golden brown and slightly springy to the touch.</p>

    <h3>8. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature, and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>These gluten-free orange cranberry muffins are not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Cranberries are rich in antioxidants, which help to combat oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. Oranges provide a healthy dose of vitamin C, boosting your immune system and promoting healthy skin. Additionally, using gluten-free flour can be easier on the digestive system for those with gluten sensitivities, making these muffins a guilt-free treat.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen cranberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen cranberries in this recipe. However, make sure to thaw and drain them before adding to the batter to avoid excess moisture.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute the yogurt with something else?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer a dairy-free option, you can use almond milk yogurt, coconut yogurt, or even applesauce as a substitute for plain yogurt.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate them for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these muffins vegan by substituting the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and using a dairy-free butter or oil and yogurt alternative.</p>
