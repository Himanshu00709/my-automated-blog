    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the warm milk, until a soft dough forms. Stir in the orange zest.</p>

    <h3>2. Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>On a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour), roll out the dough into a rectangle about ¼ inch thick. Sprinkle the surface evenly with the brown sugar and cinnamon, leaving a small border around the edges.</p>

    <h3>3. Roll and Cut</h3>
    <p>Starting from one of the longer sides, tightly roll the dough into a log. Using a sharp knife or dental floss, cut the log into 12 equal pieces. Place the rolls in a greased baking dish, leaving some space between each roll to allow for rising.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. While the rolls are baking, prepare the glaze by whisking together the powdered sugar and orange juice until smooth.</p>

    <h3>5. Glaze and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the rolls are out of the oven, let them cool for a few minutes before drizzling the glaze over the top. Serve warm and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free orange cinnamon rolls offer several nutritional benefits, especially when made with high-quality ingredients. Gluten-free flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or a blend of rice and tapioca flour can provide additional fiber and nutrients compared to traditional wheat flour. The orange zest adds a boost of vitamin C, while cinnamon is known for its anti-inflammatory properties. By using less sugar and healthier fats, you can further enhance the nutritional profile of these rolls.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these rolls ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the rolls up to the point of baking and then refrigerate them overnight. In the morning, simply let them come to room temperature and bake as directed.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free orange cinnamon rolls?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Once baked and cooled, you can freeze the rolls in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour blend for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>A blend of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch works well. You can also use a pre-mixed gluten-free flour blend that includes xanthan gum for better texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these rolls vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, simply replace the eggs with flax eggs and use a dairy-free milk and butter alternative. The rolls will still be delicious and fluffy.</p>
