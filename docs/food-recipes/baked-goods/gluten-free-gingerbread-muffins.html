    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the molasses, eggs, and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li>Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Muffins</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to achieve muffins that are moist, fluffy, and full of flavor:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a blend of flours:</strong> Combining gluten-free all-purpose flour with almond flour helps to create a tender crumb and adds a nutty flavor to the muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense, tough muffins. Mix until just combined to ensure a light texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the batter rest:</strong> Allowing the batter to rest for 10-15 minutes before baking can help the flours absorb the liquid, resulting in a better texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Gluten-free baked goods can sometimes take longer to bake, so be sure to check for doneness with a toothpick before removing from the oven.</li>
    </ul>
