<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
    <li><strong>Cut in the Butter:</strong> Add the cold butter to the dry ingredients and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, egg, and vanilla extract. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a circle about 1 inch thick. Cut the circle into 8 wedges.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until they are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the scones to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Vanilla Scones</h2>

<p>While the recipe above is straightforward, there are a few tips and tricks that can help you achieve the perfect gluten-free vanilla scones:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Cold Butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for creating flaky scones. Make sure your butter is straight from the fridge and cut it into small cubes before adding it to the dry ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough scones. Mix the dough just until the ingredients are combined, and avoid overworking it when shaping.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> While vanilla is the star of this recipe, you can easily customize your scones by adding other flavors, such as lemon zest, cinnamon, or even chocolate chips.</li>
    <li><strong>Glaze Option:</strong> For an extra touch of sweetness, consider adding a simple glaze made from powdered sugar and milk. Drizzle it over the cooled scones for a beautiful finish.</li>
</ul>
