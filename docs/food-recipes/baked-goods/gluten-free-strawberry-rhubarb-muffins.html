    <h1>Gluten-Free Strawberry Rhubarb Muffins: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>When it comes to baking, gluten-free options have become increasingly popular, not just for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but for anyone looking to explore healthier alternatives.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream together the unsalted butter (or coconut oil) and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving a tender crumb in your muffins.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Then, mix in the plain yogurt (or dairy-free alternative) until the mixture is smooth and well combined.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</p>

    <h3>6. Fold in Strawberries and Rhubarb</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the chopped strawberries and rhubarb into the batter. The tartness of the rhubarb will balance the sweetness of the strawberries, creating a harmonious flavor profile.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>These gluten-free strawberry rhubarb muffins are not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Strawberries are rich in vitamin C, antioxidants, and fiber, while rhubarb provides a good source of vitamin K and calcium. Using gluten-free flour and natural sweeteners can also make these muffins a healthier option compared to traditional recipes.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use frozen strawberries and rhubarb?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries and rhubarb. However, make sure to thaw and drain them well to avoid excess moisture in the batter.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I substitute the gluten-free flour with regular flour?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t require a gluten-free diet, you can substitute the gluten-free flour with all-purpose flour. The texture and flavor may vary slightly, but the muffins will still be delicious.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make these muffins vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these muffins vegan by substituting the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed + 3 tbsp water per egg) and using a dairy-free yogurt and butter alternative.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free strawberry rhubarb muffins are a delightful treat that combines the best of both worlds—sweet and tart flavors in a healthy, gluten-free package. Whether you’re baking for someone with dietary restrictions or simply looking to try something new, this recipe is sure to impress.
