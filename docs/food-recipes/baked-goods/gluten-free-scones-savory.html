    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Savory Scones</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free savory scones is easier than you might think. With the right ingredients and a few simple steps, you can create a batch of scones that are both delicious and nutritious. Here’s a basic recipe to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend (e.g., almond flour, coconut flour, or a pre-made blend)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cold unsalted butter (or dairy-free alternative)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated cheese (e.g., cheddar, parmesan, or a dairy-free alternative)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh herbs (e.g., chives, parsley, or rosemary)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk (or dairy-free alternative)</li>
        <li>1 egg (or flaxseed egg for a vegan option)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use your fingers or a pastry cutter to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Stir in the grated cheese and chopped herbs.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk and egg. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a circle about 1 inch thick. Cut the dough into 8 wedges and place them on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the scones are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the scones to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Savory Scones</h2>

    <p>Creating the perfect gluten-free savory scones requires a bit of finesse. Here are some tips to ensure your scones turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Ingredients:</strong> Cold butter and milk help create a flaky texture in the scones. If the butter melts too quickly, the scones may become dense.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough scones. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Don’t be afraid to get creative with your ingredients. Try adding sun-dried tomatoes, olives, or even cooked bacon for a unique twist.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Dough Rest:</strong> Allowing the dough to rest for 10-15 minutes before baking can help the gluten-free flours absorb the moisture, resulting in a better texture.</li>
    </ul>
