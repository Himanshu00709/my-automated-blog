    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure that your manicotti bakes evenly and comes out perfectly golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 1 cup of mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, chopped spinach, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated. This mixture will serve as the filling for your manicotti shells.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Manicotti Shells</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gluten-free manicotti shells and cook according to the package instructions, usually about 8-10 minutes. Be careful not to overcook them, as they will continue to cook in the oven. Once done, drain the shells and let them cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Stuff the Shells</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or a piping bag, carefully fill each manicotti shell with the cheese and spinach mixture. Make sure to fill them evenly, but avoid overstuffing, as this can cause the shells to break.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Assemble the Dish</h3>
    <p>Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange the stuffed manicotti shells in a single layer on top of the sauce. Pour the remaining marinara sauce over the shells, making sure they are fully covered. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Manicotti</h3>
    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the manicotti is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Serve warm, garnished with fresh basil or parsley if desired. Enjoy your delicious gluten-free manicotti!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Manicotti</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize the cheese filling to your liking. Cottage cheese or a blend of different cheeses can be used in place of ricotta. Just make sure the texture is similar so that the filling holds together well.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan with dairy-free alternatives. There are many plant-based cheeses available that work well in this recipe.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover manicotti?</h3>
        <p>Leftover manicotti can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply place it in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until warmed through.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free manicotti?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the manicotti before or after baking. If freezing before baking, assemble the dish as directed, then cover tightly with plastic wrap and aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 2 months. When ready to bake, thaw in the refrigerator overnight and bake as directed.</p>
