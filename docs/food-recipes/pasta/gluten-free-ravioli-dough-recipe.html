    <h1>Gluten-Free Ravioli Dough Recipe: A Delicious Alternative for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Ravioli is a classic Italian dish that has been enjoyed for centuries. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, traditional ravioli dough made with wheat flour can be off-limits. Fortunately, with the rise of gluten-free cooking, it's now possible to enjoy this beloved dish without compromising on taste or texture.

Gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, almond flour, and tapioca flour, offer a variety of nutrients and can be easier to digest for some people. Additionally, gluten-free dough can be just as flavorful and satisfying as traditional dough, making it a great alternative for everyone.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions for making gluten-free ravioli dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt. Mix well to ensure that the ingredients are evenly distributed. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add a little more water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Knead the Dough</h3>
    <p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour for dusting). Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Gluten-free dough may feel slightly different from traditional dough, but it should still hold together well and be easy to work with.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Rest the Dough</h3>
    <p>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes. This resting period allows the dough to hydrate fully and makes it easier to roll out later.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>After the dough has rested, divide it into two equal portions. Roll out one portion at a time using a rolling pin or a pasta machine. Aim for a thickness of about 1/16 inch. If using a pasta machine, start at the widest setting and gradually work your way down to the thinnest setting.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Assemble the Ravioli</h3>
    <p>Once the dough is rolled out, you can start assembling your ravioli. Place small spoonfuls of your desired filling (such as ricotta cheese, spinach, or butternut squash) onto one sheet of dough, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Brush the edges of the dough with water, then place another sheet of dough on top. Press down around the edges of each ravioli to seal, then use a ravioli cutter or a sharp knife to cut out individual ravioli.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cook the Ravioli</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully add the ravioli and cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Be gentle when stirring to prevent the ravioli from breaking apart. Once cooked, remove the ravioli with a slotted spoon and serve with your favorite sauce.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Ravioli Dough</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a different gluten-free flour blend, but keep in mind that the texture and elasticity of the dough may vary. Some blends may require additional xanthan gum or water to achieve the desired consistency.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Just make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free ravioli?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can freeze the assembled ravioli before cooking. Place them on a baking sheet in a single layer and freeze until solid, then transfer to a freezer-safe bag. Cook directly from frozen, adding an extra minute or two to the cooking time.</p>

        <h3>What fillings work best with gluten-free ravioli dough?</h3>
        <p>You can use any filling you like, but softer fillings such as ricotta cheese, spinach, or butternut squash work particularly well. Avoid overly wet fillings, as they can make the dough soggy.</p>
