    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create a mouthwatering gluten-free shrimp pasta:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Pasta</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gluten-free pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta and set it aside, reserving a small amount of pasta water for later use.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Shrimp</h3>
    <p>While the pasta is cooking, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shrimp and season with salt and pepper. Cook the shrimp for 2-3 minutes on each side until they turn pink and opaque. Remove the shrimp from the skillet and set them aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant. Add the cherry tomatoes and cook for another 2-3 minutes until they start to soften. Stir in the fresh spinach and cook until wilted.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Everything</h3>
    <p>Return the cooked shrimp to the skillet and add the cooked pasta. Toss everything together, adding a splash of the reserved pasta water if needed to create a light sauce. Drizzle with lemon juice and garnish with fresh parsley.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve the gluten-free shrimp pasta immediately, garnished with additional parsley if desired. Pair it with a side salad or a glass of white wine for a complete meal.</p>
