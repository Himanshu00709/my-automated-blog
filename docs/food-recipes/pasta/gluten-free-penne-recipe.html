    <h1>Gluten-Free Penne Recipe: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>In recent years, gluten-free diets have gained immense popularity, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also among health-conscious individuals looking to improve their overall well-being.

For instance, chickpea-based penne is high in protein and fiber, while quinoa-based penne is rich in essential amino acids.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that we have all the ingredients ready, let’s move on to the step-by-step instructions to prepare this gluten-free penne dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Penne</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gluten-free penne and cook according to the package instructions, usually around 8-10 minutes. Be sure to stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Once cooked, drain the pasta and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <p>While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic, as it can turn bitter. Next, add the halved cherry tomatoes to the skillet and cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until they start to soften and release their juices.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Pasta and Sauce</h3>
    <p>Once the tomatoes are cooked, add the cooked penne to the skillet. Toss everything together to ensure the pasta is well-coated with the sauce. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. If you’re using Parmesan cheese, sprinkle it over the pasta and give it a final toss.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Remove the skillet from the heat and garnish the pasta with freshly chopped basil. Serve immediately while hot, and enjoy your delicious gluten-free penne!</p>
