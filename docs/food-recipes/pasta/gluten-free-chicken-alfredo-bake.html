    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your bake will cook evenly and develop a golden, bubbly top.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Gluten-Free Pasta</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gluten-free pasta and cook according to the package instructions until it’s al dente. Be careful not to overcook, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy. Drain and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Alfredo Sauce</h3>
    <p>If you’re using store-bought gluten-free Alfredo sauce, simply heat it in a saucepan over medium heat. If you’re making your own, combine heavy cream, butter, garlic, and Parmesan cheese in a saucepan and simmer until thickened. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta, shredded chicken, and Alfredo sauce. Stir until everything is well-coated. Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add Cheese Topping</h3>
    <p>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese evenly over the top of the pasta mixture. This will create a delicious, cheesy crust as it bakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the edges are lightly golden. For an extra crispy top, you can broil the dish for the last 2-3 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Remove the dish from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired, and serve warm. Enjoy your gluten-free chicken alfredo bake with a side salad or steamed vegetables for a complete meal.</p>
