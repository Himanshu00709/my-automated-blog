    <h1>Gluten-Free Tortellini Recipe: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding delicious and satisfying pasta options can sometimes be a challenge.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by making the gluten-free pasta dough. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and xanthan gum. Create a well in the center of the flour mixture and crack the eggs into it. Add the olive oil and begin to mix the ingredients together. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough feels too dry, you can add a small amount of water. Once the dough is ready, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>

    <p>While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped spinach, ground nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated. Set the filling aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Roll Out the Dough</h3>

    <p>After the dough has rested, divide it into four equal portions. Roll out one portion at a time on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Roll the dough as thin as possible, aiming for a thickness of about 1/16 inch. Use a round cookie cutter or a glass to cut out circles of dough, approximately 2-3 inches in diameter.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Tortellini</h3>

    <p>Place a small amount of the filling (about 1 teaspoon) in the center of each dough circle. Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, pressing the edges to seal. Bring the two corners of the half-moon together and press to form the classic tortellini shape. Repeat this process with the remaining dough and filling.</p>

    <h3>5. Cook the Tortellini</h3>

    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully drop the tortellini into the boiling water and cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Be careful not to overcrowd the pot; you may need to cook the tortellini in batches. Once cooked, remove the tortellini with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a serving dish.</p>

    <h3>6. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Your gluten-free tortellini is now ready to be served! You can enjoy it with a simple tomato sauce, a creamy Alfredo sauce, or even a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Pair it with a fresh salad or some garlic bread for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Tortellini</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different type of cheese for the filling?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While ricotta and Parmesan are classic choices, you can experiment with other cheeses like goat cheese, feta, or even a blend of your favorites. Just make sure the cheese is soft enough to mix well with the other ingredients.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I store leftover tortellini?</h3>
        <p>If you have leftover tortellini, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply boil them for a few minutes until warmed through. You can also freeze uncooked tortellini for up to 2 months. Place them on a baking sheet in a single layer, freeze until solid, and then transfer to a freezer bag.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Just make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out. Allow the dough to come to room temperature before rolling it out.</p>

        <h3>4. What’s the best gluten-free flour blend for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>There are many gluten-free flour blends available, but for pasta, a blend that includes rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch works well. You can also make your own blend by combining these flours in equal parts. The key is to ensure the blend has a good balance of structure and elasticity.</p>

With a few simple ingredients and some patience, you can create a meal that’s both delicious and suitable for a gluten-free diet.
