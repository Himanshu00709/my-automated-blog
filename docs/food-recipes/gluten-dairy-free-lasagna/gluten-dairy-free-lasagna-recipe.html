    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure that your lasagna bakes evenly and comes out perfectly cooked.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until the onion is translucent. Add the ground turkey or plant-based meat and cook until browned. Stir in the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
    <p>In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of gluten-free lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread a layer of dairy-free ricotta cheese over the noodles, followed by a layer of the sauce. Sprinkle some dairy-free mozzarella cheese on top. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of sauce and a generous sprinkle of dairy-free mozzarella cheese.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let the lasagna cool for about 10 minutes before serving.</p>

    <h3>5. Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Garnish the lasagna with freshly chopped parsley before serving. This adds a burst of freshness and color to the dish. Serve with a side salad or garlic bread for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular lasagna noodles instead of gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have a gluten intolerance, you can certainly use regular lasagna noodles. However, for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, gluten-free noodles are essential to avoid adverse health effects.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of dairy-free cheese?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use dairy-free cheese, you can make a cashew-based cheese sauce or use nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor. Both options are delicious and provide a creamy texture similar to traditional cheese.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this lasagna ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can assemble the lasagna ahead of time and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours before baking. This makes it a convenient option for meal prep or entertaining.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftover lasagna can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave until warmed through.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free dairy-free lasagna is a delicious and healthy alternative to traditional lasagna, perfect for those with dietary restrictions or anyone looking to try something new. With the right ingredients and a little bit of effort, you can create a dish that's just as satisfying and flavorful as the original. So why not give this recipe a try?
