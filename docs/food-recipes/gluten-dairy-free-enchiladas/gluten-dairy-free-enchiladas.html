<h1>Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Enchiladas: A Delicious and Healthy Twist</h1>

<p>Enchiladas are a beloved dish in many households, known for their rich flavors and comforting warmth. However, for those with dietary restrictions such as gluten intolerance or lactose intolerance, traditional enchiladas can be off-limits.

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Enchiladas?</h2>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure that your enchiladas cook evenly and develop a nice, golden crust.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Filling</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked shredded chicken, black beans, and diced onions. If you're using a plant-based protein, make sure it's well-seasoned and cooked according to package instructions. Mix everything together until well combined.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble the Enchiladas</h3>
<p>Take a gluten-free tortilla and place a generous spoonful of the filling in the center. Roll the tortilla tightly and place it seam-side down in a baking dish. Repeat this process until all the tortillas are filled and arranged in the dish.</p>

<h3>4. Add the Sauce and Cheese</h3>
<p>Pour the gluten-free enchilada sauce evenly over the rolled tortillas, making sure each one is well-coated. Sprinkle the dairy-free cheese on top, ensuring an even distribution.</p>

<h3>5. Bake</h3>
<p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the sauce is bubbling. Keep an eye on the enchiladas to prevent them from burning.</p>

<h3>6. Garnish and Serve</h3>
<p>Once the enchiladas are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve warm. You can also add a dollop of dairy-free sour cream or guacamole for extra flavor.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make these enchiladas vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the shredded chicken with a plant-based protein like tofu, tempeh, or jackfruit. Make sure to season it well to mimic the flavors of traditional enchiladas.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free tortillas?</h3>
    <p>If you can't find gluten-free tortillas, you can use large lettuce leaves or even thinly sliced zucchini as a wrap. These alternatives are not only gluten-free but also add a fresh, crisp texture to your enchiladas.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftover enchiladas?</h3>
    <p>Leftover enchiladas can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply place them in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10-15 minutes, or until heated through.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze these enchiladas?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze gluten-free dairy-free enchiladas. Assemble the enchiladas as directed, but instead of baking, cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil and freeze. When ready to eat, bake from frozen at 375°F (190°C) for 30-40 minutes, or until heated through.</p>
