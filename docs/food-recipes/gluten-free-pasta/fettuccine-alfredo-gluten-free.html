    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gluten-free fettuccine and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong> In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Pour in the heavy cream and bring to a gentle simmer.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Pasta and Sauce:</strong> Add the cooked fettuccine to the skillet and toss to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce. Sprinkle in the grated Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Season and Serve:</strong> Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Fettuccine Alfredo</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free Fettuccine Alfredo turns out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Pasta:</strong> Not all gluten-free pastas are created equal. Look for brands that use high-quality ingredients like brown rice, quinoa, or corn. These tend to have a better texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook the Pasta:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can become mushy if overcooked. Follow the package instructions carefully and taste the pasta a minute or two before the recommended cooking time.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Freshly grated Parmesan cheese and high-quality butter will make a significant difference in the flavor of your sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the Sauce Consistency:</strong> If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of pasta water to thin it out. If it’s too thin, let it simmer for a few more minutes to reduce.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fettuccine Alfredo</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different type of gluten-free pasta?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any type of gluten-free pasta you prefer. However, fettuccine or a similar flat noodle works best for this dish as it holds the sauce well.</p>

        <h3>2. Is Fettuccine Alfredo gluten-free in restaurants?</h3>
        <p>Not always. Traditional Fettuccine Alfredo is made with wheat-based pasta, so it’s essential to ask the restaurant if they offer a gluten-free version. Some restaurants may also use flour as a thickener in the sauce, so be sure to inquire about the ingredients.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this dish dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a dairy-free version by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative, using coconut cream instead of heavy cream, and opting for a dairy-free Parmesan cheese.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop, adding a splash of cream or milk to restore the sauce’s consistency.</p>
