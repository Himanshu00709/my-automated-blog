    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Vegetables:</strong> In a large saucepan, melt the butter or heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped celery, onion, and garlic, and sauté until the vegetables are soft and fragrant, about 5-7 minutes.</li>

        <li><strong>Add Creaminess:</strong> Stir in the heavy cream or coconut milk, and continue to simmer until the soup thickens, about 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Season:</strong> Add salt and pepper to taste. If desired, you can also add a pinch of thyme or parsley for extra flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Blend (Optional):</strong> For a smoother consistency, use an immersion blender to puree the soup until it reaches your desired texture.</li>
