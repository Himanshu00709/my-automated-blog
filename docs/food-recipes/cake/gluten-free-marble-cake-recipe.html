    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals who are looking to reduce their gluten intake for health reasons. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause digestive issues for some people. By using gluten-free flours and other ingredients, you can create baked goods that are safe and enjoyable for everyone.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>To make a gluten-free marble cake, you’ll need the following ingredients:</p>
    <table>

            <th>Ingredient</th>
            <th>Quantity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>

    </table>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch loaf pan or round cake pan and line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Create the Chocolate Batter</h3>
    <p>Transfer about one-third of the batter to a separate bowl. Add the cocoa powder to this portion and mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Layer and Swirl</h3>
    <p>Pour the vanilla batter into the prepared pan. Then, dollop the chocolate batter on top. Use a knife or skewer to swirl the two batters together to create a marble effect.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the cake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or a blend of gluten-free flours. However, the texture and taste may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and use a dairy-free milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other flavors to the cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different flavors by adding citrus zest, spices, or even a layer of fruit preserves between the batters.</p>
    </div>
