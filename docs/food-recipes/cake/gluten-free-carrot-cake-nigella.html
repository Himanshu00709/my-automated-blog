    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these steps to create Nigella's gluten-free carrot cake:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) and grease a cake tin with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the almond flour, ground flaxseed, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, honey or maple syrup, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Add carrots and walnuts:</strong> Fold in the grated carrots and chopped walnuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the tin for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve as is or with a dollop of cream cheese frosting.</li>
