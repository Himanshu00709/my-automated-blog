    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making your gluten-free flag cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Alternate Dry and Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined after each addition.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Divide and Color the Batter</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter into three equal portions. Leave one portion plain (this will be the white part of the flag). Color the second portion with red food coloring and the third with blue food coloring.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake the Layers</h3>
    <p>Pour each colored batter into the prepared cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool completely before assembling.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Assemble and Decorate</h3>
    <p>Once the cakes are cool, stack them with a layer of whipped cream or frosting in between. Use fresh strawberries and blueberries to create the flag design on top of the cake. Arrange the strawberries in rows to represent the red stripes and place the blueberries in the top left corner to represent the stars.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfecting Your Gluten-Free Flag Cake</h2>
    <p>Here are some additional tips to ensure your gluten-free flag cake turns out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking and has a good texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until just combined to keep the cake light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the cakes cool completely:</strong> Assembling the cake while it’s still warm can cause the layers to slide or the frosting to melt.</li>
        <li><strong>Get creative with decorations:</strong> While strawberries and blueberries are traditional, you can also use other fruits or even gluten-free sprinkles to add a festive touch.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Flag Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and use a dairy-free milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, but keep in mind that different flours have different textures and absorbencies. You may need to adjust the amount of liquid in the recipe if you’re using a different flour blend.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. If you’ve used fresh fruit, it’s best to consume the cake within 1-2 days to prevent the fruit from becoming too soft.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>A gluten-free flag cake is a wonderful way to celebrate any patriotic occasion while accommodating dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and a little creativity, you can create a dessert that’s not only delicious but also visually stunning. Whether you’re hosting a Fourth of July party, a Memorial Day barbecue, or just want to show your patriotic spirit, this gluten-free flag cake is sure to be a hit.
