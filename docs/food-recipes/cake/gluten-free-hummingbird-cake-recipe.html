    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon. Set this mixture aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In another bowl, combine the mashed bananas, crushed pineapple (with juice), vegetable oil, granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. Fold in the chopped pecans.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Frost</h3>
    <p>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, frost with your favorite cream cheese frosting or a simple glaze.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Hummingbird Cake</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free Hummingbird Cake turns out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast the pecans:</strong> Toasting the pecans before adding them to the batter enhances their flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the cake cool completely before frosting:</strong> This prevents the frosting from melting and sliding off the cake.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this cake dairy-free by using a dairy-free cream cheese frosting or a simple glaze made with powdered sugar and a dairy-free milk alternative.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of nut?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you’re not a fan of pecans, you can substitute them with walnuts or even omit the nuts altogether.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. If refrigerated, let the cake come to room temperature before serving for the best texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the unfrosted cake layers. Wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature before frosting and serving.</p>
    </div>
