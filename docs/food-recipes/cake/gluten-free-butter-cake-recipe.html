<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper to ensure the cake doesn't stick. This step is crucial for achieving a perfectly baked cake that easily releases from the pan.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This process usually takes about 3-4 minutes with an electric mixer. The goal is to incorporate air into the mixture, which helps the cake rise and become tender.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>

<p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. This ensures that each egg is fully incorporated into the batter, resulting in a smooth and even texture. Finally, mix in the vanilla extract for that classic butter cake flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. It's important to use a gluten-free flour blend that contains xanthan gum, as this helps mimic the elasticity that gluten provides in traditional baking. If your blend doesn't include xanthan gum, you can add 1/2 teaspoon to the dry ingredients.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Alternate Adding Dry Ingredients and Milk</h3>

<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk. Start and end with the dry ingredients, mixing just until combined after each addition. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cake. The batter should be smooth and slightly thick.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake the Cake</h3>

<p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The baking time may vary slightly depending on your oven, so keep an eye on the cake during the last few minutes.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>

<p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can dust the cake with powdered sugar, drizzle it with a glaze, or serve it as is with a dollop of whipped cream or fresh berries.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Butter Cake</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours like almond flour or coconut flour, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor of the cake may vary. It's best to use a gluten-free flour blend specifically designed for baking to achieve the best results.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a dairy-free milk such as almond milk or oat milk. Just make sure to choose unsweetened varieties to avoid altering the sweetness of the cake.</p>

    <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
    <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months. To freeze, wrap the cake tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I add other flavors to the cake?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can customize the cake by adding different flavors such as lemon zest, orange zest, or even a teaspoon of almond extract. You can also fold in chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruit for added texture and flavor.</p>
