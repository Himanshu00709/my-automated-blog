<h2>Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Pork Tenderloin</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 375째F (190째C). While the oven is heating, prepare the pork tenderloin. Pat it dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. This will help the seasoning stick better and ensure a nice sear.</p>

<h3>2. Seasoning the Pork</h3>

<p>In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, minced garlic, thyme, rosemary, salt, and black pepper. Rub this mixture all over the pork tenderloin, making sure to coat it evenly. Let the pork sit for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</p>

<h3>3. Searing the Pork</h3>

<p>Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet. Once the oil is hot, sear the pork tenderloin on all sides until it develops a golden-brown crust. This should take about 2-3 minutes per side. Searing the pork helps to lock in the juices and adds a depth of flavor to the final dish.</p>

<h3>4. Preparing the Glaze</h3>

<p>While the pork is searing, prepare the glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the gluten-free soy sauce, Dijon mustard, honey, and apple cider vinegar. This glaze will add a sweet and tangy flavor to the pork, complementing the savory herbs perfectly.</p>

<h3>5. Baking the Pork Tenderloin</h3>

<p>Once the pork is seared, brush the glaze generously over the entire surface of the tenderloin. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the pork reaches 145째F (63째C). Use a meat thermometer to ensure accuracy.</p>

<h3>6. Resting and Serving</h3>

<p>After removing the pork from the oven, let it rest for about 10 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, ensuring a moist and tender result. Slice the pork into medallions and serve with your favorite gluten-free sides, such as roasted vegetables or a fresh salad.</p>

    <p>Yes, this recipe is naturally dairy-free. The glaze and seasoning do not contain any dairy products, making it a great option for those with dairy allergies or intolerances.</p>
