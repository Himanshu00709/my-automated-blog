    <h2>Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Stuffing</h3>

    <p>Start by heating a tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, sautéing until they become translucent. Next, add the chopped spinach and cook until it wilts. In a mixing bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, gluten-free breadcrumbs, sautéed vegetables, grated Parmesan cheese, and fresh herbs. Mix well and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Pork Chops</h3>

    <p>Using a sharp knife, make a horizontal cut into the side of each pork chop to create a pocket for the stuffing. Be careful not to cut all the way through. Stuff each pork chop generously with the prepared quinoa and vegetable mixture. Secure the opening with toothpicks if necessary.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Pork Chops</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Heat the remaining olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the stuffed pork chops for about 2-3 minutes on each side until they develop a golden-brown crust. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the pork reaches 145°F (63°C).</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once the pork chops are cooked through, remove them from the oven and let them rest for 5 minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring a moist and flavorful bite. Serve your gluten-free stuffed pork chops with a side of roasted vegetables or a fresh salad for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Stuffed Pork Chops</h2>

    <p>This dish is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Pork is a great source of high-quality protein, which is essential for muscle repair and growth. The quinoa and vegetables in the stuffing provide fiber, vitamins, and minerals, making this a well-rounded meal. Additionally, using gluten-free ingredients ensures that this dish is safe for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute pork chops with chicken breasts or even turkey cutlets. Just make sure to adjust the cooking time accordingly to ensure the meat is fully cooked.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free breadcrumbs, you can use crushed gluten-free crackers, almond flour, or even ground oats as a substitute.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftover stuffed pork chops can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat them in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this dish?</h3>
