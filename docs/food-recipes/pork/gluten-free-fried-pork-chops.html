    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Pork Chops</h3>

    <p>Start by patting the pork chops dry with a paper towel. This helps the coating adhere better. Season both sides of the pork chops with salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. Let them sit for about 10 minutes to absorb the flavors.</p>

    <h3>2. Set Up Your Breading Station</h3>

    <p>In three separate shallow dishes, place the gluten-free flour, beaten eggs, and gluten-free breadcrumbs. This setup ensures an even coating for each pork chop.</p>

    <h3>3. Coat the Pork Chops</h3>

    <p>Dredge each pork chop in the gluten-free flour, shaking off any excess. Next, dip the pork chop into the beaten eggs, ensuring it’s fully coated. Finally, press the pork chop into the gluten-free breadcrumbs, making sure the entire surface is covered.</p>

    <h3>4. Fry the Pork Chops</h3>

    <p>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the breaded pork chops in the skillet. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until the pork chops are golden brown and reach an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C).</p>

    <h3>5. Rest and Serve</h3>

    <p>Remove the pork chops from the skillet and let them rest on a paper towel-lined plate for a few minutes. This helps remove excess oil and ensures the chops remain juicy. Serve with your favorite sides, such as mashed potatoes or a fresh salad.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Fried Pork Chops</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Oil:</strong> Use an oil with a high smoke point, such as avocado oil or olive oil, to prevent burning.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcrowd the Pan:</strong> Fry the pork chops in batches to ensure even cooking and a crispy coating.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Meat Thermometer:</strong> To avoid overcooking, check the internal temperature of the pork chops. They should reach 145°F (63°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Seasonings:</strong> Feel free to add other spices or herbs to the breadcrumb mixture for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fried Pork Chops</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this recipe works well with chicken breasts or turkey cutlets. Adjust the cooking time based on the thickness of the meat.</p>

        <h3>2. What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>You can use crushed gluten-free crackers, cornmeal, or even ground nuts like almonds or pecans for a unique twist.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I bake the pork chops instead of frying them?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and bake the breaded pork chops on a greased baking sheet for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover pork chops in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or on the stovetop to maintain crispiness.</p>
