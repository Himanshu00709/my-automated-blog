    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, xanthan gum (if using), and salt. Mix these dry ingredients thoroughly to ensure even distribution.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the olive oil and warm water. Stir the mixture until it forms a dough. If the dough feels too dry, add a little more water, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the desired consistency.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Knead the Dough</h3>
    <p>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Knead the dough for about 2-3 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Be careful not to over-knead, as this can make the dough tough.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Shape the Dough</h3>
    <p>Roll out the dough into your desired pizza shape. You can make a traditional round pizza or experiment with rectangular or square shapes. Place the dough on a parchment-lined baking sheet or pizza stone.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add Toppings and Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Add your favorite pizza toppings, such as tomato sauce, cheese, vegetables, or meats. Bake the pizza for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the toppings are cooked through.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pizza Dough</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t skip the xanthan gum:</strong> Xanthan gum helps bind the dough and gives it a more elastic texture, similar to traditional pizza dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the dough rest:</strong> If you have time, let the dough rest for 10-15 minutes before rolling it out. This allows the flour to fully hydrate and makes the dough easier to work with.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Just wrap it tightly in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I freeze the dough?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This dough freezes well. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer-safe bag. It can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator before using.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What can I use instead of xanthan gum?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have xanthan gum, you can use guar gum or psyllium husk as a substitute. Both work well to bind the dough and improve its texture.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free pizza dough without yeast is easier than you might think. With just a few simple ingredients and minimal effort, you can create a delicious, healthy pizza crust that everyone will love. Whether you're cooking for yourself or hosting a pizza night with friends, this recipe is sure to impress.
