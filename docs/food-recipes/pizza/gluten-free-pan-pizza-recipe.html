    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by activating the yeast. In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt. Gradually add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms. The dough should be slightly sticky but manageable. If it's too dry, add a little more water; if it's too wet, add a bit more flour.</p>

    <h3>2. Let the Dough Rise</h3>

    <p>Once the dough is ready, cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 30-45 minutes. This will allow the dough to double in size and develop a light, airy texture. While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C) and prepare your toppings.</p>

    <h3>3. Shape the Dough</h3>

    <p>After the dough has risen, transfer it to a well-oiled cast-iron skillet or a baking pan. Use your hands to press the dough evenly across the bottom of the pan, creating a thick crust around the edges. If the dough is too sticky, lightly oil your hands to make it easier to handle.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Toppings</h3>

    <p>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce. Add your favorite toppings, such as pepperoni, mushrooms, or bell peppers. Be creative and customize your pizza to your liking!</p>

    <h3>5. Bake the Pizza</h3>

    <p>Place the skillet or baking pan in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Keep an eye on the pizza to prevent over-baking, as gluten-free dough can cook faster than traditional dough.</p>

    <h3>6. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve your gluten-free pan pizza hot, and enjoy the delicious flavors and textures that rival any traditional pizza!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, such as almond flour, coconut flour, or a pre-made gluten-free flour mix. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly depending on the flour you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the dough in advance and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. When you're ready to bake, let the dough come to room temperature before shaping and adding toppings.</p>

        <h3>Is xanthan gum necessary?</h3>
        <p>Xanthan gum is a common ingredient in gluten-free baking as it helps to bind the dough and improve its texture. If your gluten-free flour blend already contains xanthan gum, you may not need to add extra. However, if it doesn't, adding xanthan gum is recommended for the best results.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the pizza?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked pizza for up to 2 months. To reheat, simply place the frozen pizza in a preheated oven at 350째F (175째C) for 10-15 minutes, or until heated through.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Creating a gluten-free pan pizza at home is not only possible but also incredibly rewarding. With the right ingredients and a bit of patience, you can enjoy a pizza that is both delicious and suitable for a gluten-free diet. This recipe offers a perfect balance of flavors and textures, making it a great option for family dinners, gatherings, or even a cozy night in. So, roll up your sleeves, gather your ingredients, and get ready to savor a gluten-free pizza that will impress everyone at the table!</p>
