<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

<p>Start by activating the yeast. In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt. Add the activated yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour.</p>

<h3>2. Preheat the Oven</h3>

<p>While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up as well. This will help achieve a crispy crust.</p>

<h3>3. Prepare the Toppings</h3>

<p>While the dough is rising, prepare your toppings. Shred the mozzarella cheese, slice your favorite vegetables, and cook any meats you plan to use. Set these aside until you’re ready to assemble the pizza.</p>

<h3>4. Assemble the Pizza</h3>

<p>Once the dough has risen, press it into a well-greased deep-dish pizza pan or a cast-iron skillet. Make sure to press the dough up the sides to form a deep crust. Layer the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the dough. Add your desired toppings, and then pour the tomato sauce over the top. Sprinkle with additional cheese if desired.</p>

<h3>5. Bake the Pizza</h3>

<p>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly. If you’re using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza to the stone for the last 10 minutes of baking to achieve a crispier crust.</p>

<h3>6. Let it Cool and Serve</h3>

<p>Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for about 5-10 minutes. This will make it easier to slice and serve. Enjoy your gluten-free Chicago-style pizza with your favorite side dishes or a fresh salad.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking and contains xanthan gum or another binding agent.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Xanthan Gum:</strong> Xanthan gum is essential for giving the dough elasticity and preventing it from becoming crumbly.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the Dough Rise:</strong> Allowing the dough to rise will help develop flavor and texture. Be patient and give it the full hour to rise.</li>
    <li><strong>Use a Deep-Dish Pan:</strong> A deep-dish pizza pan or cast-iron skillet is ideal for achieving the classic Chicago-style crust.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make this pizza vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make this pizza vegan by using plant-based cheese and toppings. Ensure that your gluten-free flour blend is also vegan-friendly.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze the dough?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the dough for up to 3 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer-safe bag. Thaw it in the refrigerator before using.</p>

    <h3>What other toppings can I use?</h3>
    <p>You can use any toppings you like, such as mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, olives, or even pineapple. Be creative and customize it to your taste.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! While mozzarella is traditional, you can experiment with other cheeses like cheddar, provolone, or a blend of your favorites.</p>
