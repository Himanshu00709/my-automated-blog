    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of the ingredients. Add the olive oil and warm water, then stir until a dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour. Knead the dough gently for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Shape the Pizza Bites</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll the dough into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving some space between each one. Use your thumb or the back of a spoon to create a small indentation in the center of each ball.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Toppings</h3>
    <p>Spoon a small amount of tomato sauce into the indentation of each dough ball. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top, and add a slice of pepperoni if desired. Finish by sprinkling a pinch of Italian seasoning over the top for added flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Pizza Bites</h3>
    <p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the dough is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pizza Bites</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking to ensure the best texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overwork the dough:</strong> Gluten-free dough can become tough if over-kneaded. Handle it gently to keep the bites light and tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with toppings:</strong> While mozzarella and pepperoni are classic choices, feel free to get creative with your toppings. Try adding vegetables, different cheeses, or even a drizzle of pesto for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pizza Bites</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these pizza bites ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough and shape the pizza bites ahead of time. Store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before baking. You can also freeze the unbaked bites and bake them directly from the freezer, adding a few extra minutes to the baking time.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While mozzarella is a classic choice, you can use any cheese that melts well, such as cheddar, provolone, or even a dairy-free alternative if you’re avoiding dairy.</p>

        <h3>Are gluten-free pizza bites healthy?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free pizza bites can be a healthier option compared to traditional pizza, especially if you use whole-grain gluten-free flour and load them with vegetables. However, like any snack, moderation is key.</p>
