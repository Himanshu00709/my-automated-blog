    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, xanthan gum, and salt. In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients, and mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it’s smooth and elastic.</p>

    <h3>2. Let the Dough Rise</h3>
    <p>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. The dough should double in size.</p>

    <h3>3. Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). While the oven is heating, prepare your deep dish pizza pan by greasing it with olive oil or lining it with parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>4. Shape the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, press it into the prepared pizza pan, making sure to spread it evenly across the bottom and up the sides. The crust should be about 1/4 inch thick.</p>

    <h3>5. Add Toppings</h3>
    <p>Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, followed by a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese. Add your favorite toppings, such as pepperoni, mushrooms, or bell peppers.</p>

    <h3>6. Bake the Pizza</h3>
    <p>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Deep Dish Pizza</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a blend of gluten-free flours:</strong> A mix of rice flour, tapioca flour, and almond flour can help achieve the perfect texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t skip the xanthan gum:</strong> Xanthan gum is essential for binding the dough and giving it elasticity.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the dough rest:</strong> Allowing the dough to rise properly will result in a lighter, airier crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat your pan:</strong> Preheating the pizza pan can help achieve a crispier crust.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe without xanthan gum?</h3>
        <p>Xanthan gum is crucial for binding the dough in gluten-free baking. If you don’t have xanthan gum, you can try using guar gum, but the texture may be slightly different.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the dough?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the dough after it has risen. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and store it in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator before using.</p>

        <h3>What other toppings can I use?</h3>
        <p>You can customize your pizza with any toppings you like. Some popular options include sausage, onions, olives, and spinach. Just make sure all toppings are gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While mozzarella is traditional, you can experiment with other cheeses like cheddar, provolone, or even a dairy-free alternative if you’re lactose intolerant.</p>

Whether you’re new to gluten-free baking or a seasoned pro, this recipe is sure to become a favorite in your household.
