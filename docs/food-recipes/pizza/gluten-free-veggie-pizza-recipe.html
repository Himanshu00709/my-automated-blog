    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that we have all the ingredients ready, let's move on to the step-by-step instructions to make your gluten-free veggie pizza.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you're using a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats to ensure it gets hot enough to cook the pizza evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>If you're using pre-made gluten-free pizza dough, follow the package instructions for preparation. If you're making your own, roll out the dough on a floured surface (use gluten-free flour) to your desired thickness. Transfer the dough to a pizza pan or parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Sauce and Toppings</h3>
    <p>Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce. Then, layer the bell peppers, red onion, mushrooms, black olives, and spinach on top. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Pizza</h3>
    <p>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly. Keep an eye on the pizza to prevent burning, as gluten-free dough can cook faster than traditional dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Slice it into pieces and serve immediately. Enjoy your delicious, gluten-free veggie pizza!</p>
