<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare Your Ingredients</h3>

<p>Start by grating your cheese and setting it aside. If you’re using garlic, peel and cut the clove in half, then rub it around the inside of your fondue pot to infuse the flavor. This step is optional but adds a nice depth to the fondue.</p>

<h3>2. Heat the Wine or Broth</h3>

<p>Pour the gluten-free white wine or broth into the fondue pot and heat it over medium heat until it begins to simmer. Be careful not to let it boil, as this can affect the texture of the cheese.</p>

<h3>3. Add the Cheese</h3>

<p>Gradually add the grated cheese to the pot, stirring constantly to ensure it melts evenly. This process should be done slowly to avoid clumping. If the mixture seems too thick, you can add a bit more wine or broth to achieve your desired consistency.</p>

<h3>4. Thicken the Fondue</h3>

<p>In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch or gluten-free flour with a bit of cold water to create a slurry. Add this to the fondue pot, stirring continuously until the mixture thickens. This step is crucial for achieving the perfect fondue texture.</p>

<h3>5. Season and Serve</h3>

<p>Add a pinch of nutmeg and a tablespoon of lemon juice to the fondue, stirring well to combine. Transfer the pot to your fondue burner and serve immediately with your choice of gluten-free dippers.</p>

<h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>

<p>When it comes to serving gluten-free cheese fondue, the possibilities are endless. Here are some ideas for gluten-free dippers:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Gluten-Free Bread:</strong> Look for gluten-free baguettes or breadsticks that can be cut into bite-sized pieces.</li>
    <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and bell peppers are all excellent choices.</li>
    <li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Apples and pears add a sweet contrast to the savory cheese.</li>
    <li><strong>Meats:</strong> Cooked sausages or cured meats can also be dipped into the fondue.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cheese Fondue</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use any cheese for gluten-free fondue?</h3>

    <h3>2. What can I use instead of wine in gluten-free fondue?</h3>
    <p>If you prefer not to use wine, you can substitute it with gluten-free broth, such as vegetable or chicken broth. This will still provide the necessary liquid for melting the cheese.</p>

    <h3>3. How do I prevent the cheese from clumping?</h3>
    <p>To prevent clumping, make sure to grate the cheese finely and add it to the pot gradually, stirring constantly. Adding a bit of lemon juice can also help keep the cheese smooth.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I make gluten-free fondue ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>While fondue is best served fresh, you can prepare the cheese mixture ahead of time and reheat it gently on the stove or in a fondue pot. Be sure to stir well to maintain a smooth consistency.</p>
