<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
<p>Start by chopping the onion, mincing the garlic, and slicing the carrots and celery. Dice the potatoes into bite-sized pieces. Ensure that all ingredients are ready before you begin cooking to make the process smoother.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Brown the Chicken</h3>
<p>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chicken thighs and cook until they are browned on both sides, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
<p>In the same pot, add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté for 2-3 minutes until the onion becomes translucent. Add the sliced carrots and celery, and continue to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add the Potatoes and Seasonings</h3>
<p>Add the diced potatoes to the pot, along with the thyme, bay leaves, salt, and black pepper. Stir to combine all the ingredients.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Add the Chicken Broth and Tomato Paste</h3>
<p>Pour in the gluten-free chicken broth and add the tomato paste. Stir well to ensure that the tomato paste is fully dissolved in the broth.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Return the Chicken to the Pot</h3>
<p>Place the browned chicken thighs back into the pot, nestling them among the vegetables. Bring the stew to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once the stew is ready, remove the bay leaves and discard them. Ladle the stew into bowls and serve hot. You can garnish with fresh parsley if desired.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use chicken breasts instead of thighs?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use chicken breasts if you prefer. However, chicken thighs tend to be more flavorful and tender, making them a better choice for stews.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this stew in a slow cooker?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! To make this stew in a slow cooker, follow the steps to brown the chicken and sauté the vegetables, then transfer everything to the slow cooker. Cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high for 3-4 hours.</p>

    <h3>How can I thicken the stew without using flour?</h3>
    <p>If you prefer a thicker stew, you can mash some of the cooked potatoes and stir them back into the stew. Alternatively, you can use a small amount of cornstarch mixed with water to thicken the broth.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze this stew?</h3>
    <p>Yes, this stew freezes well. Allow it to cool completely before transferring it to an airtight container. It can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before reheating.</p>
