    <h1>Gluten-Free Vegan Sourdough Pancakes: A Healthy Breakfast Delight</h1>

    <p>Breakfast is often hailed as the most important meal of the day, and what better way to start your morning than with a stack of fluffy, gluten-free vegan sourdough pancakes? These pancakes are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients, making them a perfect choice for those with dietary restrictions or anyone looking to enjoy a healthier breakfast option.

Second, they are entirely plant-based, which means they contain no animal products, making them ideal for vegans. Lastly, the use of sourdough starter in the recipe adds a unique tangy flavor and improves the digestibility of the pancakes by breaking down some of the gluten-like proteins found in gluten-free flours.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to make your gluten-free vegan sourdough pancakes:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Batter:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, sourdough starter, non-dairy milk, maple syrup, baking powder, and salt. Mix until smooth. Let the batter rest for 10-15 minutes to allow the sourdough to activate.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Pan:</strong> Preheat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a small amount of coconut oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pancakes:</strong> Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as fresh fruit, maple syrup, or vegan butter.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free vegan sourdough pancakes offer several nutritional benefits. The use of gluten-free flour ensures that the pancakes are safe for those with gluten intolerance, while the sourdough starter aids in digestion by breaking down complex carbohydrates. Additionally, the pancakes are rich in fiber, especially if you use a whole-grain gluten-free flour blend. The absence of animal products makes them lower in saturated fat, and the use of non-dairy milk provides essential vitamins and minerals like calcium and vitamin D.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours like almond flour, buckwheat flour, or chickpea flour. However, the texture and taste may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover pancakes?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover pancakes in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them for up to 2 months. Reheat in a toaster or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the batter the night before?</h3>

        <h3>What can I use instead of maple syrup?</h3>
        <p>You can use other sweeteners like agave syrup, date syrup, or even mashed bananas for a natural sweetness.</p>
