    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This will ensure that your sliders bake evenly and the cheese melts perfectly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Slider Buns</h3>
    <p>Slice the gluten-free slider buns in half horizontally, keeping them connected if possible. Place the bottom half of the buns in a baking dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Layer the Ham and Cheese</h3>
    <p>Layer the ham slices evenly over the bottom half of the buns. Follow this by placing the cheese slices on top of the ham. You can use a single type of cheese or mix and match for added flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Top Buns</h3>
    <p>Place the top half of the buns over the cheese and ham layers. Press down gently to ensure everything stays in place.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Prepare the Glaze</h3>
    <p>In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Once melted, add the Dijon mustard, honey, poppy seeds, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Stir until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Brush the Glaze Over the Sliders</h3>
    <p>Using a pastry brush, generously brush the glaze over the top of the sliders. Make sure to cover the entire surface for maximum flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake the Sliders</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the buns are golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Remove the sliders from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Slice them into individual sliders and serve warm. Enjoy your delicious gluten-free ham and cheese sliders!</p>
