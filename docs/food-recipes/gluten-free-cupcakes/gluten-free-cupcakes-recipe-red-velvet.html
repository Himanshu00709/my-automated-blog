    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step instructions for making these gluten-free red velvet cupcakes:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer on medium speed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract until fully incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined; overmixing can lead to dense cupcakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Add Food Coloring and Vinegar</h3>
    <p>Stir in the red food coloring until the batter reaches your desired shade of red. Then, add the white vinegar and mix gently. The vinegar will react with the baking soda, helping the cupcakes rise and become fluffy.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Fill Cupcake Liners</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or an ice cream scoop, fill each cupcake liner about two-thirds full with the batter. This will allow enough room for the cupcakes to rise without overflowing.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the cupcakes in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Be careful not to overbake, as this can dry out the cupcakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Cool and Frost</h3>
    <p>Allow the cupcakes to cool in the muffin tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, frost with your favorite gluten-free cream cheese frosting or any frosting of your choice.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Red Velvet Cupcakes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cupcakes. Mix until just combined to ensure a light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Gel Food Coloring:</strong> Gel food coloring is more concentrated than liquid, so you’ll need less to achieve a vibrant red color.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Use a toothpick to check if the cupcakes are done. If it comes out clean, they’re ready.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these cupcakes dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these cupcakes dairy-free by substituting the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and using a dairy-free buttermilk substitute (mix 1 cup of almond milk with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar).</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>While this recipe is designed for a gluten-free flour blend, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like almond flour or coconut flour. However, the texture and rise may vary, so adjustments may be needed.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cupcakes?</h3>
        <p>Store the cupcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. If frosted, it’s best to keep them refrigerated.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze these cupcakes?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the unfrosted cupcakes for up to 3 months. Wrap them individually in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe container. Thaw at room temperature before frosting and serving.</p>
