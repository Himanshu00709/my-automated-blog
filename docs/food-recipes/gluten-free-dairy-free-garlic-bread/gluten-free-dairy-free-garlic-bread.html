    <h1>Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Garlic Bread: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>Garlic bread is a beloved side dish that complements a wide variety of meals, from pasta to salads. However, for those with dietary restrictions such as gluten intolerance or lactose intolerance, traditional garlic bread can be off-limits.

Additionally, many gluten-free and dairy-free products are made with whole, nutrient-dense ingredients that can contribute to a healthier diet overall.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free dairy-free garlic bread:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure that your garlic bread bakes evenly and achieves a golden, crispy exterior.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Garlic Butter</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine the dairy-free butter, minced garlic, chopped parsley, nutritional yeast (if using), and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are fully incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Slice the Bread</h3>
    <p>Slice the gluten-free bread loaf into even slices, about 1-inch thick. Be careful not to slice the bread too thin, as it may become too crispy and lose its soft interior.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Spread the Garlic Butter</h3>
    <p>Using a butter knife or a small spatula, spread the garlic butter mixture evenly over each slice of bread. Make sure to cover the entire surface for maximum flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Bread</h3>
    <p>Place the prepared bread slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the butter is bubbly.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Remove the garlic bread from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with additional chopped parsley if desired, and enjoy your delicious gluten-free dairy-free garlic bread!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Garlic Bread</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use any type of gluten-free bread?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any type of gluten-free bread for this recipe. However, for the best results, choose a high-quality gluten-free bread that has a good texture and flavor. Some brands offer gluten-free baguettes or artisan-style bread that works particularly well for garlic bread.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of dairy-free butter?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have dairy-free butter on hand, you can substitute it with olive oil or coconut oil. Keep in mind that the flavor will be slightly different, but it will still be delicious.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the garlic butter mixture and slice the bread ahead of time. Store the garlic butter in an airtight container in the refrigerator and the bread in a bread bag. When you’re ready to bake, simply spread the butter on the bread and bake as directed.</p>

        <h3>Is nutritional yeast necessary?</h3>
        <p>Nutritional yeast is optional, but it adds a cheesy, umami flavor to the garlic bread without using any dairy. If you don’t have nutritional yeast, you can omit it, or you can try adding a small amount of grated dairy-free cheese for a similar effect.</p>
