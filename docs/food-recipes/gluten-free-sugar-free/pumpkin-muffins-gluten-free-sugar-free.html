    <p>Pumpkin is a nutritional powerhouse, making it an excellent ingredient for healthy baking. It’s rich in vitamins A and C, which support immune function and skin health. Pumpkin is also high in fiber, aiding digestion and promoting a feeling of fullness. Additionally, it contains antioxidants that help reduce inflammation and protect against chronic diseases. When combined with gluten-free flours and natural sweeteners, pumpkin creates a muffin that’s both delicious and nutritious.</p>
