<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make these recipes ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, many of these recipes can be prepared ahead of time. The stuffing can be assembled a day in advance and baked just before serving. The mashed potatoes can be made a day ahead and reheated on the stovetop with a little extra almond milk to keep them creamy. The pumpkin pie can also be made a day ahead and stored in the refrigerator until ready to serve.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of almond milk in the mashed potatoes?</h3>
    <p>If you prefer not to use almond milk, you can substitute it with another non-dairy milk, such as oat milk, soy milk, or coconut milk. Each will impart a slightly different flavor, so choose one that you enjoy.</p>

    <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin puree?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! If you prefer to use fresh pumpkin, you can roast a sugar pumpkin, remove the flesh, and puree it in a food processor until smooth. Just make sure to drain any excess liquid from the puree to ensure your pie filling isn’t too watery.</p>
