    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free sheet pan pancakes is straightforward. Follow these steps for perfect pancakes every time:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). This ensures that the oven is at the right temperature when you’re ready to bake.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, and melted butter (or oil). Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the pancakes dense.</p>

    <h3>3. Pour the Batter onto the Sheet Pan</h3>
    <p>Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Pour the batter onto the sheet pan, spreading it evenly with a spatula. The batter should be about 1/4 inch thick.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Toppings</h3>
    <p>This is where you can get creative! Sprinkle your favorite toppings over the batter. Some popular options include fresh berries, chocolate chips, nuts, or even a swirl of peanut butter.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the sheet pan in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the pancakes are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>6. Serve</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the sheet pan from the oven and let the pancakes cool for a few minutes. Cut them into squares or rectangles and serve with your favorite syrup, butter, or additional toppings.</p>

    <h2>Creative Topping Ideas</h2>
    <p>One of the best things about sheet pan pancakes is the ability to customize them with a variety of toppings. Here are some ideas to get you started:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Topping</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>Chocolate Chips</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Nuts</td>
                <td>Chopped almonds, walnuts, or pecans add a nice crunch and extra protein.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Banana Slices</td>
                <td>Add a tropical twist with slices of banana. They also pair well with chocolate chips.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Peanut Butter Swirl</td>
                <td>Drizzle peanut butter over the batter before baking for a rich, nutty flavor.</td>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these pancakes ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes! You can prepare the batter the night before and store it in the refrigerator. Just give it a quick stir before pouring it onto the sheet pan. Alternatively, you can bake the pancakes ahead of time and reheat them in the oven or toaster.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free sheet pan pancakes?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. Once baked and cooled, cut the pancakes into portions and place them in a freezer-safe bag or container. They can be reheated in the microwave or oven for a quick breakfast option.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour blend to use?</h3>
        <p>Look for a gluten-free flour blend that includes xanthan gum, as it helps mimic the texture of gluten. Popular brands include Bob’s Red Mill, King Arthur Flour, and Cup4Cup.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these pancakes vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make vegan gluten-free sheet pan pancakes by using a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) and a non-dairy milk alternative like almond or oat milk.</p>
