    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, salt, and sugar.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, vanilla extract, and melted butter.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense pancakes.</li>
        <li>Gently fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pancakes</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free pancakes can be a bit different from making traditional pancakes, but with a few tips, you can achieve perfect results every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right combination of flours and starches to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough pancakes. Stir the batter until just combined, and it's okay if there are a few lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the batter rest:</strong> Allowing the batter to rest for 5-10 minutes before cooking can help the flours absorb the liquid, resulting in fluffier pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook on medium heat:</strong> Cooking pancakes on too high heat can cause them to burn on the outside while remaining undercooked on the inside. Medium heat is ideal for even cooking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Pancakes</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I make these pancakes dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make these pancakes dairy-free by using a non-dairy milk (such as almond milk, soy milk, or oat milk) and a dairy-free butter substitute. Just make sure to check that your chocolate chips are also dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While a gluten-free flour blend works well, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or oat flour. Keep in mind that different flours may require adjustments to the liquid ingredients to achieve the right consistency.</p>

        <h3>3. How do I store leftover pancakes?</h3>
        <p>Leftover pancakes can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them for up to 2 months. To reheat, simply pop them in the toaster or microwave until warm.</p>

        <h3>4. Are gluten-free pancakes healthier than regular pancakes?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free pancakes can be a healthier option for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. However, the nutritional value depends on the ingredients used. Opting for whole-grain gluten-free flours and natural sweeteners can enhance the nutritional profile of your pancakes.</p>
