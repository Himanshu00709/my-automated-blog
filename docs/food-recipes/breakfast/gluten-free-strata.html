    <h1>Gluten-Free Strata: A Delicious and Nutritious Breakfast Option</h1>

    <p>Breakfast is often hailed as the most important meal of the day, and for good reason. It sets the tone for your energy levels, metabolism, and overall well-being. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding satisfying and nutritious breakfast options can sometimes be a challenge. Enter the gluten-free strata—a versatile, flavorful, and easy-to-make dish that is perfect for breakfast, brunch, or even dinner. In this article, we’ll explore what a gluten-free strata is, its nutritional benefits, and how you can make your own at home.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Strata</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I make a gluten-free strata ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free strata is an excellent make-ahead dish. You can assemble the strata the night before and refrigerate it overnight. In the morning, simply bake it as directed. This makes it a convenient option for busy mornings or when hosting brunch.</p>

        <h3>2. What type of gluten-free bread works best?</h3>
        <p>Any gluten-free bread will work, but denser varieties like those made with whole grains (e.g., quinoa, brown rice) tend to hold up better and absorb the egg mixture more effectively. Avoid bread that is too soft or crumbly, as it may disintegrate during baking.</p>

        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute dairy milk with almond milk, oat milk, or any other non-dairy alternative. For the cheese, use a dairy-free cheese or simply omit it altogether. The strata will still be delicious and satisfying.</p>

        <h3>4. How long does gluten-free strata last?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free strata can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. To reheat, simply place a slice in the microwave or oven until warmed through. It’s a great option for meal prep or leftovers.</p>
