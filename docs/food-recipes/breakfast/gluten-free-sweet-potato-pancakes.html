    <h1>Gluten-Free Sweet Potato Pancakes: A Healthy Breakfast Delight</h1>
    <p>Breakfast is often hailed as the most important meal of the day, and for good reason. It sets the tone for your energy levels, metabolism, and overall well-being. If you're looking for a nutritious, gluten-free option that doesn't compromise on taste, sweet potato pancakes are an excellent choice.

    <h2>Why Sweet Potatoes?</h2>
    <p>Sweet potatoes are a nutritional powerhouse. They are rich in vitamins A and C, which are essential for immune function and skin health. They also contain a good amount of dietary fiber, which aids in digestion and helps maintain stable blood sugar levels. Additionally, sweet potatoes are naturally gluten-free, making them an ideal ingredient for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Their natural sweetness reduces the need for added sugars, making them a healthier alternative to traditional pancake recipes.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free sweet potato pancakes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sweet Potato:</strong> Start by cooking the sweet potato. You can either bake it in the oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 45 minutes or microwave it for 5-7 minutes until soft. Once cooked, peel and mash the sweet potato until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the mashed sweet potato, eggs, almond milk, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pancakes:</strong> Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with coconut oil. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as fresh fruit, maple syrup, or a dollop of Greek yogurt.</li>
