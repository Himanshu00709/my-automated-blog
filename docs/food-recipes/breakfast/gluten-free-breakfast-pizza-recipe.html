    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get cooking! Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free breakfast pizza.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). If you're using a store-bought gluten-free pizza crust, follow the package instructions for preheating. If you're making your own crust, ensure it's rolled out and ready to go.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Toppings</h3>
    <p>In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onions and bell peppers, and sauté until they are softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add the spinach or kale and cook until wilted. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Whisk the Eggs</h3>
    <p>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. Season with salt and pepper to taste. This mixture will serve as the "sauce" for your breakfast pizza.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Pizza</h3>
    <p>Place the gluten-free pizza crust on a baking sheet or pizza stone. Spread the sautéed vegetables evenly over the crust. Pour the egg mixture over the vegetables, ensuring it covers the entire surface. Sprinkle the shredded cheese and cooked bacon or sausage on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Pizza</h3>
    <p>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Keep an eye on it to prevent over-browning.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Slice it into wedges and serve warm. Enjoy your delicious and nutritious gluten-free breakfast pizza!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the milk with a dairy-free alternative like almond, oat, or soy milk, and use a dairy-free cheese. Many brands offer excellent dairy-free cheese options that melt well and taste great.</p>

        <h3>Can I prepare this pizza ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the pizza the night before and store it in the refrigerator. When you're ready to eat, simply reheat it in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes, or until warmed through.</p>

        <h3>What other toppings can I use?</h3>
        <p>The possibilities are endless! You can add mushrooms, tomatoes, avocado, or even a sprinkle of nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor. Feel free to get creative and use whatever ingredients you love.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for meal prep?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this gluten-free breakfast pizza is perfect for meal prep. You can make a large batch, slice it into portions, and store it in the fridge or freezer. It reheats well and makes for a quick and easy breakfast throughout the week.</p>
