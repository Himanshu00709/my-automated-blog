They also contain antioxidants that help fight free radicals, reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Additionally, the acidity of limes aids in digestion and can help detoxify your body.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the recipe:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, softened butter, and ¼ cup of granulated sugar. Mix until the dough comes together. Press the dough evenly into the bottom of the prepared baking pan. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Lime Filling</h3>
    <p>While the crust is baking, whisk together the eggs, remaining ½ cup of granulated sugar, lime juice, and lime zest in a separate bowl. Once the crust is done, pour the lime filling over the hot crust and return it to the oven. Bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is set.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cool and Dust</h3>
    <p>Allow the lime bars to cool completely in the pan before transferring them to a cutting board. Dust with powdered sugar and cut into squares. Serve and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use bottled lime juice instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>While fresh lime juice is recommended for the best flavor, you can use bottled lime juice in a pinch. Just make sure it's 100% lime juice without any added sugars or preservatives.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these lime bars ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! These lime bars can be made a day in advance and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They also freeze well for up to a month.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What can I use instead of almond flour?</h3>
        <p>If you have a nut allergy, you can substitute almond flour with an equal amount of gluten-free oat flour or coconut flour. Keep in mind that the texture may vary slightly.</p>
    </div>
