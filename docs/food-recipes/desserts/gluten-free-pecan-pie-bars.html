    <h1>Gluten-Free Pecan Pie Bars: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>Pecan pie is a classic dessert that many people love, but for those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying this treat can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free pecan pie bars—a delightful alternative that combines the rich, buttery flavor of traditional pecan pie with a gluten-free crust.

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Pecan Pie Bars?</h2>

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free pecan pie bars can be made with healthier ingredients, such as almond flour or oat flour, which provide additional nutrients like protein and fiber.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut sugar, and melted butter. Mix until the ingredients are well combined and form a dough-like consistency. Press the dough evenly into the bottom of a greased 9x9 inch baking pan. Bake the crust for 10-12 minutes, or until it is lightly golden. Remove from the oven and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and salt until well combined. Stir in the chopped pecans, ensuring they are evenly coated with the mixture. Pour the filling over the pre-baked crust, spreading it out evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Bars</h3>
    <p>Place the pan back in the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the filling is set and the top is golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow the bars to cool completely in the pan before cutting them into squares.</p>
