    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a bundt pan thoroughly with butter or non-stick spray, then dust it with a light coating of gluten-free flour to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Flavorings</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the lemon juice, lemon zest, Greek yogurt, and vanilla extract until fully combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared bundt pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then invert it onto a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with powdered sugar or drizzle with a lemon glaze before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use room temperature ingredients to ensure even mixing.</li>
        <li>Don’t skip the step of greasing and flouring the bundt pan—it’s crucial for easy removal.</li>
        <li>For an extra lemony flavor, add a tablespoon of lemon zest to the glaze.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the gluten-free all-purpose flour with a 1:1 gluten-free baking blend. However, avoid using only almond flour, as it may alter the texture.</p>

        <h3>How do I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or refrigerate for up to a week. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Replace the butter with coconut oil or a dairy-free margarine, and use a dairy-free yogurt alternative.</p>
