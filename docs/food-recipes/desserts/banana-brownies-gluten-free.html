    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free banana brownies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash the bananas:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. The riper the bananas, the sweeter your brownies will be.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix wet ingredients:</strong> Add the eggs, melted coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract to the mashed bananas. Whisk until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Ensure there are no lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Add chocolate chips:</strong> If using, fold in the dark chocolate chips for an extra layer of richness.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the brownies to cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
