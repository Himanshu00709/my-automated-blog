<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions for making these gluten-free cookie bars.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you’re ready to bake the bars.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Baking Pan</h3>
<p>Line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper or lightly grease it with butter or oil. This will prevent the bars from sticking to the pan and make it easier to remove them once they’re baked.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, and salt. This ensures that the dry ingredients are evenly distributed, which is crucial for the texture of the bars.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Cream the Butter and Sugars</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter (or coconut oil) with the brown sugar and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This step is important as it helps to incorporate air into the mixture, making the bars lighter.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Add the Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
<p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Then, mix in the vanilla extract. This adds moisture and flavor to the bars.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the bars dense.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Fold in the Chocolate Chips</h3>
<p>Gently fold in the chocolate chips (or your chosen mix-ins) until they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

<h3>Step 8: Bake the Bars</h3>
<p>Spread the batter evenly into the prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>Step 9: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the bars to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, cut into squares and serve.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make these bars vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can easily make these bars vegan by substituting the butter with coconut oil and using a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) instead of regular eggs.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can use almond flour, coconut flour, or any other gluten-free flour blend. Just keep in mind that different flours may alter the texture slightly.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these cookie bars?</h3>
    <p>Store the bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I add nuts or dried fruit?</h3>
    <p>Yes, feel free to customize the bars with your favorite mix-ins like nuts, dried fruit, or even shredded coconut.</p>
