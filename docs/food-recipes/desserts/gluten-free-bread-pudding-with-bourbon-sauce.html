<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Bread Pudding</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with butter or cooking spray. In a large bowl, combine the cubed gluten-free bread and optional raisins or dried cranberries. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, heavy cream, eggs, granulated sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt. Pour this mixture over the bread cubes, ensuring that all the bread is evenly coated. Let the mixture sit for about 15 minutes to allow the bread to absorb the liquid.</p>

<h3>2. Baking the Pudding</h3>

<p>Transfer the bread mixture to the prepared baking dish, spreading it out evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the center is set. You can test the doneness by inserting a knife into the center; it should come out clean.</p>

<h3>3. Making the Bourbon Sauce</h3>

<p>While the bread pudding is baking, prepare the bourbon sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the brown sugar and stir until it dissolves. Slowly pour in the bourbon, stirring constantly. Let the mixture simmer for about 5 minutes, or until it thickens slightly. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>

<h3>4. Serving the Dessert</h3>

<p>Once the bread pudding is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Serve warm, drizzled with the bourbon sauce. For an extra touch, you can add a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use any type of gluten-free bread?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free bread you prefer. However, for the best texture, choose a bread that is slightly stale or has a denser texture. This will help the bread hold up better when soaked in the custard mixture.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the whole milk and heavy cream with your favorite non-dairy alternatives, such as almond milk or coconut milk. Just ensure that the substitutes are unsweetened to avoid altering the dessert's sweetness.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover bread pudding in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave or oven before serving. The bourbon sauce can be stored separately and reheated gently on the stovetop.</p>

    <h3>Can I omit the bourbon from the sauce?</h3>
    <p>Yes, if you prefer a non-alcoholic version, you can omit the bourbon or replace it with a teaspoon of bourbon extract. The sauce will still be delicious, though it will lack the distinctive bourbon flavor.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free bread pudding with bourbon sauce is a delightful dessert that proves you don't have to sacrifice flavor when following a gluten-free diet. With its rich, custardy texture and the warm, boozy kick of the bourbon sauce, this dessert is sure to impress. Whether you're serving it at a holiday gathering or enjoying it as a special treat at home, this gluten-free bread pudding is a recipe you'll want to make again and again.
