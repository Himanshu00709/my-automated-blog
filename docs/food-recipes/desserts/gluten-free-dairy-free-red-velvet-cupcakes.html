    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with cupcake liners. This ensures that your cupcakes will bake evenly and won’t stick to the pan.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. This ensures that all the dry ingredients are evenly distributed, which is crucial for a consistent texture.</p>

    <h3>3. Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the dairy-free milk and apple cider vinegar. Let it sit for a few minutes to curdle, creating a buttermilk substitute. Then, add the granulated sugar, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and red food coloring. Whisk until well combined.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense cupcakes.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter evenly among the prepared cupcake liners, filling each about two-thirds full. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cupcakes to cool completely before frosting.</p>

    <h3>6. Prepare the Frosting</h3>
    <p>While the cupcakes are cooling, prepare the dairy-free cream cheese frosting. In a mixing bowl, beat the dairy-free cream cheese and dairy-free butter until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar, beating until the frosting is light and fluffy.</p>

    <h3>7. Frost and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the cupcakes are completely cool, frost them with the dairy-free cream cheese frosting. You can use a piping bag for a professional look or simply spread the frosting with a knife. Serve and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Red Velvet Cupcakes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cupcakes. Mix until just combined for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Cupcakes Cool Completely:</strong> Frosting warm cupcakes can cause the frosting to melt and slide off. Patience is key!</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Natural Food Coloring:</strong> If you prefer to avoid artificial food coloring, try using beet juice or natural food coloring alternatives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture may vary. A blend that includes rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch usually works well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these cupcakes vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make these cupcakes vegan, ensure that your sugar is vegan-friendly (some sugars are processed with bone char) and use a plant-based food coloring.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store these cupcakes?</h3>
        <p>Store the cupcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. If refrigerated, let them come to room temperature before serving for the best texture.</p>
    </div>
