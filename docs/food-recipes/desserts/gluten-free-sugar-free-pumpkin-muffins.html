    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's get baking! Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free sugar-free pumpkin muffins:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with coconut oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together 2 cups of almond flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon of ginger. Ensure that the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix 1 cup of pumpkin puree, 3 large eggs, 1/4 cup of melted coconut oil, and 1/2 cup of stevia or monk fruit sweetener. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fill the Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full. This allows room for the muffins to rise.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>These gluten-free sugar-free pumpkin muffins are not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Almond flour is rich in healthy fats, protein, and fiber, making it a great alternative to traditional wheat flour. Pumpkin puree is loaded with vitamins A and C, which support immune health and vision. Additionally, using natural sweeteners like stevia or monk fruit helps keep your blood sugar levels stable, making these muffins a great option for those managing diabetes or looking to reduce their sugar intake.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different flour instead of almond flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of pumpkin puree?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer using fresh pumpkin, simply roast and puree it before adding it to the recipe. Ensure that the puree is smooth and free of lumps.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for longer storage.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or chocolate chips to the recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, feel free to customize your muffins by adding chopped nuts, sugar-free chocolate chips, or even dried fruit for extra texture and flavor.</p>
