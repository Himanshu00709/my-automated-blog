    <h1>Gluten-Free Texas Sheet Cake: A Delicious Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Texas Sheet Cake is a beloved dessert known for its rich, chocolatey flavor and moist texture.

    <h2>What is Texas Sheet Cake?</h2>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Texas Sheet Cake</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free Texas Sheet Cake is surprisingly easy, and the process is very similar to making the traditional version. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a large sheet pan (approximately 18x13 inches) with butter or cooking spray.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, baking soda, and salt. Mix well to ensure that all the ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the water and cocoa powder, stirring until the mixture is smooth. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the melted butter mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until well combined. Add the buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla extract, and mix until the batter is smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared sheet pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Prepare the Frosting</h3>
    <p>While the cake is baking, you can prepare the frosting. In a medium saucepan, melt 1/2 cup of butter over medium heat. Add 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and 6 tablespoons of milk, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat and gradually add 3 cups of powdered sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, mixing until the frosting is smooth and creamy.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Frost the Cake</h3>
    <p>Once the cake is out of the oven, immediately pour the warm frosting over the top, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Let the cake cool completely before cutting into squares and serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfecting Your Gluten-Free Texas Sheet Cake</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free Texas Sheet Cake turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will give you the best texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Cake Cool Before Frosting:</strong> While the frosting should be poured over the cake while it’s still warm, make sure the cake has cooled slightly to prevent the frosting from melting too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours like almond flour or coconut flour, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. It’s best to use a gluten-free flour blend specifically designed for baking.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil, and use a non-dairy milk in place of buttermilk. Just make sure to adjust the quantities as needed.</p>

        <h3>How do I know when the cake is done?</h3>
        <p>The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The edges should also start to pull away from the sides of the pan.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cake for up to 3 months. Make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn. Thaw in the refrigerator before serving.</p>
