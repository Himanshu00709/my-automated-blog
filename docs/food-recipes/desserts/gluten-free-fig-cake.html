    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free fig cake is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a delicious and healthy dessert:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and greasing a cake pan with a little oil or lining it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the figs:</strong> Wash and chop the fresh figs into small pieces. If using dried figs, soak them in warm water for 10 minutes to soften them before chopping.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the wet ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, honey (or maple syrup), vanilla extract, and oil until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the figs:</strong> Gently fold the chopped figs into the batter, ensuring they are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the cake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve as is or with a dollop of whipped cream or yogurt.</li>
