    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and make cleanup easier.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Egg and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the egg and vanilla extract to the butter-sugar mixture and mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cookies tough.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in Andes Mint Chocolates</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the chopped Andes Mint chocolates into the cookie dough. This will ensure that every bite is filled with minty chocolate goodness.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your delicious Gluten-Free Andes Mint Cookies!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to achieve perfect results every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right combination of flours and starches to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough:</strong> If the dough is too soft, chilling it for 30 minutes before baking can help the cookies hold their shape better.</li>
        <li><strong>Use parchment paper:</strong> This prevents the cookies from sticking to the baking sheet and ensures even baking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don’t need the cookies to be gluten-free. However, the texture and taste may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute the Andes Mint chocolates?</h3>
        <p>If you can’t find Andes Mint chocolates, you can use other mint chocolate candies or even add a few drops of peppermint extract to the dough for a similar flavor.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours before baking. This can actually enhance the flavor of the cookies.</p>
