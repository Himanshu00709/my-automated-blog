    <h1>Gluten-Free Pineapple Upside Down Cupcakes: A Tropical Delight</h1>

    <p>If you're looking for a dessert that combines the nostalgic charm of pineapple upside-down cake with the convenience of cupcakes, you're in for a treat.

    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Topping</h3>

    <p>Start by preparing the pineapple and cherry topping. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan, then stir in ½ cup of brown sugar until it dissolves. Spoon this mixture evenly into the bottom of each cupcake liner. Place a pineapple ring on top of the sugar mixture in each liner, and add a maraschino cherry in the center of each ring.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Cupcake Batter</h3>

    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Spoon the batter evenly over the pineapple and cherry topping in each cupcake liner, filling each about two-thirds full. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Allow the cupcakes to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then carefully invert them onto a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cupcakes</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be able to achieve perfect cupcakes every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right combination of flours and starches to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cupcakes. Mix until the ingredients are just combined to ensure a light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the cupcakes cool before inverting:</strong> Allowing the cupcakes to cool slightly in the pan before flipping them will help the topping set and prevent it from sticking to the liner.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh pineapple instead of canned?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh pineapple, but make sure to cut it into thin rings and remove the core. Fresh pineapple may not be as sweet as canned, so you might want to add a bit more sugar to the topping.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cupcakes dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and use a non-dairy milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cupcakes?</h3>
        <p>Store the cupcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different fruit topping?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different fruits like peaches, mangoes, or even berries. Just make sure to adjust the sugar in the topping accordingly.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free pineapple upside-down cupcakes are a delightful and easy-to-make dessert that brings a tropical twist to your baking repertoire. Whether you're catering to a gluten-free diet or simply looking to try something new, these cupcakes are sure to impress.
