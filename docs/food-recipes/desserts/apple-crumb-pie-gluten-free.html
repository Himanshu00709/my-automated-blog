    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Pie Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by making the pie crust. Combine 1 1/2 cups of gluten-free flour blend with 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a large bowl. Cut in 1/2 cup of cold butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add 3-4 tablespoons of ice water, mixing until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Apple Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough chills, prepare the apple filling. In a large bowl, toss the sliced apples with 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Set aside to allow the flavors to meld.</p>

    <h3>3. Create the Crumb Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, combine 1/2 cup of gluten-free flour blend, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and 1/2 cup of cold butter. Use your fingers to mix until the mixture forms coarse crumbs. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface and transfer it to a 9-inch pie dish. Trim and crimp the edges. Pour the apple filling into the crust, spreading it evenly. Sprinkle the crumb topping over the apples.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the pie for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Allow the pie to cool before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Apple Crumb Pie</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use store-bought gluten-free pie crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a store-bought gluten-free pie crust if you’re short on time. However, making your own crust allows you to control the ingredients and achieve a fresher taste.</p>

        <h3>2. What type of apples are best for apple pie?</h3>
        <p>For the best flavor and texture, use a mix of tart and sweet apples such as Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, or Fuji. This combination ensures a balanced filling that’s not too sweet or too tart.</p>

        <h3>3. How do I store leftover gluten-free apple crumb pie?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover pie in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the pie for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make this pie vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a vegan version by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using a vegan-friendly gluten-free flour blend.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free apple crumb pie is a delightful dessert that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions.
