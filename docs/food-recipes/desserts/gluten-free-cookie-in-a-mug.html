    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Mug:</strong> Start by selecting a microwave-safe mug. Make sure it's large enough to allow the cookie to rise without overflowing.</li>

        <li><strong>Add the Wet Ingredients:</strong> Add the melted butter and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Stir until the mixture forms a thick batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Chocolate Chips:</strong> Fold in the chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
