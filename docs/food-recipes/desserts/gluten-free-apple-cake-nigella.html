    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s move on to the baking process. Follow these steps to create a mouth-watering gluten-free apple cake that will impress your family and friends.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 180°C (350°F). This ensures that your cake bakes evenly and rises properly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Cake Tin</h3>
    <p>Grease a 20cm (8-inch) cake tin with butter and line it with parchment paper. This will prevent the cake from sticking to the tin and make it easier to remove once baked.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, ground almonds, and baking powder. Mix well to ensure that the ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and caster sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This step is crucial as it helps to incorporate air into the batter, resulting in a lighter cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Eggs and Flavorings</h3>
    <p>Beat the eggs one at a time into the butter and sugar mixture, ensuring that each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Then, add the vanilla extract and lemon zest, mixing well to combine.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, being careful not to overmix. Overmixing can lead to a dense cake, so mix just until the ingredients are combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Add the Apples</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the chopped apples, ensuring that they are evenly distributed throughout the batter. The apples will add moisture and natural sweetness to the cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the tin for 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve the cake as is or with a dusting of powdered sugar for an extra touch of sweetness.</p>
