    <h1>Gluten-Free Lemon Shortbread Cookies: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Shortbread cookies are a classic treat that many of us have enjoyed since childhood. Their buttery, crumbly texture and subtle sweetness make them a favorite for tea time or as a quick snack. But what if you're following a gluten-free diet? Enter gluten-free lemon shortbread cookies—a delightful twist on the traditional recipe that caters to those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. In this blog post, we'll explore the world of gluten-free baking, focusing on how to make these zesty, melt-in-your-mouth cookies that everyone can enjoy.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Baking?</h2>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delightful cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly and achieve that perfect golden-brown color.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer. The creaming process incorporates air into the dough, which helps the cookies achieve a tender texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Lemon Zest and Juice</h3>
    <p>Next, add the freshly grated lemon zest and lemon juice to the butter-sugar mixture. The zest provides a burst of citrus flavor, while the juice adds a subtle tanginess. Mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Incorporate the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cookies tough.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Shape the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough comes together, shape it into a log about 2 inches in diameter. Wrap the log in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Chilling the dough makes it easier to slice and helps the cookies hold their shape during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Slice and Bake</h3>
    <p>After chilling, remove the dough from the refrigerator and slice it into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Place the rounds on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving about 1 inch of space between each cookie. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, these gluten-free lemon shortbread cookies are ready to be enjoyed with a cup of tea or as a sweet treat any time of day.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly depending on the flour you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. Just make sure to use a product that has a similar fat content to butter for the best results.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. For longer storage, you can freeze the dough or baked cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other flavors to these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Certainly! You can experiment with different citrus zests like orange or lime, or even add a touch of lavender or rosemary for a unique twist.</p>
