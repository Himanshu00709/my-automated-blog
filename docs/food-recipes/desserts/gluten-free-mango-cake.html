    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free mango cake is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a moist and flavorful cake that everyone will love:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Mango Puree:</strong> Peel and dice the ripe mangoes, then blend them into a smooth puree using a food processor or blender.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream the unsalted butter (or coconut oil) and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with the mango puree. Mix until just combined—avoid overmixing to keep the cake tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Cake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream or a drizzle of mango glaze for extra flavor.</li>
    </ol>
