    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create your gluten-free pumpkin snickerdoodles:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, cream of tartar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the wet ingredients:</strong> Beat in the pumpkin puree, egg, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the cinnamon sugar:</strong> In a small bowl, mix together the 1/4 cup of granulated sugar and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon for rolling the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the cookies:</strong> Scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of dough and roll them into balls. Roll each ball in the cinnamon sugar mixture until fully coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the dough balls on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pumpkin Snickerdoodles</h2>
    <p>To ensure your cookies turn out perfectly every time, here are a few tips to keep in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough if necessary:</strong> If your dough is too sticky to handle, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before shaping the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> These cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the cookies to be gluten-free. Simply substitute the gluten-free flour blend with an equal amount of all-purpose flour.</p>

        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin puree?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer to use fresh pumpkin, simply roast or steam the pumpkin until tender, then puree it in a blender or food processor until smooth. Make sure to drain any excess liquid to avoid a soggy dough.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these cookies vegan by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of a regular egg.</p>

        <h3>Why do I need cream of tartar in snickerdoodles?</h3>
        <p>Cream of tartar is a key ingredient in traditional snickerdoodles. It reacts with the baking soda to create a slightly tangy flavor and helps give the cookies their characteristic chewy texture.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free pumpkin snickerdoodles are a delightful twist on a classic cookie, perfect for fall gatherings or just a cozy night in. With their warm spices, chewy texture, and pumpkin-infused flavor, these cookies are sure to impress. Whether you're gluten-free or not, these cookies are a must-try this season.
