    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Fruit Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine your chosen fruit with sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, and vanilla extract. Stir well to ensure the fruit is evenly coated. The sugar will help sweeten the fruit, while the cornstarch will thicken the juices as the cobbler bakes.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free Bisquick with milk and melted butter. Stir until the mixture forms a thick, dough-like consistency. If the mixture seems too dry, you can add a little more milk, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the desired texture.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Cobbler</h3>
    <p>Pour the fruit mixture into a greased baking dish. Drop spoonfuls of the Bisquick topping over the fruit, spreading it out slightly but leaving some gaps for the fruit to peek through. This will give your cobbler that classic, rustic look.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit filling is bubbling. Let the cobbler cool for a few minutes before serving to allow the filling to set.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Cobbler</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Fruit:</strong> While berries, peaches, and apples are popular choices, you can use any fruit you like. Just make sure to adjust the sugar and cornstarch quantities based on the sweetness and juiciness of the fruit.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Spices:</strong> Add a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, or cardamom to the fruit filling for an extra layer of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Go Dairy-Free:</strong> If you’re avoiding dairy, use a non-dairy milk alternative like almond or oat milk, and substitute the butter with a dairy-free option.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Warm:</strong> Cobbler is best enjoyed warm, preferably with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ul>
