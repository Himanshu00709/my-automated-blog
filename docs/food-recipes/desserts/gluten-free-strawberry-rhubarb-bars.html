    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, granulated sugar, and salt. Cut in the cold butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press the mixture evenly into the bottom of a greased 9x13 inch baking pan. Bake the crust for about 15 minutes, or until it is lightly golden.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>

    <p>While the crust is baking, prepare the filling. In a medium saucepan, combine the chopped strawberries, rhubarb, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens and the fruit softens. This should take about 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>

    <p>Once the crust is done baking, spread the strawberry rhubarb filling evenly over the crust. Return the pan to the oven and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is set and the edges are golden brown. Allow the bars to cool completely before cutting them into squares.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Strawberry Rhubarb Bars</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh strawberries and rhubarb will give you the best flavor. If fresh rhubarb is not available, you can use frozen, but make sure to thaw and drain it well.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for a flaky crust. Make sure your butter is well-chilled before cutting it into the flour mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it Cool:</strong> Allow the bars to cool completely before cutting. This will help the filling set and make it easier to cut into neat squares.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends. However, keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary slightly depending on the blend you use.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these bars ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! These bars can be made a day in advance and stored in an airtight container at room temperature. They also freeze well, so you can make a batch and freeze them for later.</p>

        <h3>Can I use other fruits?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the strawberries and rhubarb with other fruits like blueberries, raspberries, or peaches. Just adjust the sugar and cornstarch accordingly to balance the sweetness and thickness of the filling.</p>
