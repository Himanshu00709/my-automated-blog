    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper. This will prevent the brownies from sticking and make it easier to remove them after baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the almond flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Ensure that there are no lumps in the mixture, as this will help achieve a smooth batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and then add the melted butter or coconut oil, vanilla extract, and erythritol or stevia. Mix until well combined. The sugar substitute should dissolve completely into the mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense brownies. The batter should be thick and fudgy.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Brownies</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Avoid overbaking to maintain the fudgy texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the brownies to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, cut into squares and serve. For an extra touch, you can dust the brownies with a bit of powdered erythritol or drizzle with sugar-free chocolate sauce.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different flour instead of almond flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly. Coconut flour, for example, is more absorbent, so you may need to adjust the quantity of wet ingredients.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of erythritol or stevia?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use erythritol or stevia, you can use other natural sweeteners like monk fruit or xylitol. Just be sure to adjust the quantity according to the sweetness level of the substitute you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these brownies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these brownies vegan by replacing the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons of water per egg) and using coconut oil instead of butter. The texture may be slightly different, but they will still be delicious.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these brownies?</h3>
        <p>Store the brownies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months. Just be sure to wrap them tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil before freezing.</p>
