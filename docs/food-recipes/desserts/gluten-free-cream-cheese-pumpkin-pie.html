    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making your gluten-free cream cheese pumpkin pie.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pie Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). If you're using a store-bought gluten-free pie crust, follow the package instructions for pre-baking. If you're making your own crust, roll it out and place it in a 9-inch pie dish. Crimp the edges and prick the bottom with a fork to prevent air bubbles. Bake the crust for about 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Cream Cheese Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until it's smooth and creamy. Add the granulated sugar and continue to beat until well combined. Next, add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Finally, stir in the vanilla extract. Pour the cream cheese mixture into the pre-baked pie crust and spread it evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Pumpkin Filling</h3>
    <p>In another bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, heavy cream, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, ground ginger, and salt. Mix until all the ingredients are well incorporated. Carefully pour the pumpkin mixture over the cream cheese layer in the pie crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Pie</h3>
    <p>Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the center is set and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Keep an eye on the pie during the last 10 minutes of baking to prevent over-browning. If the edges of the crust start to brown too quickly, you can cover them with aluminum foil.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the pie is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack. This will allow the filling to set properly. Once cooled, you can refrigerate the pie for a few hours before serving. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream or a sprinkle of cinnamon for an extra touch of flavor.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Pumpkin Pie</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free pumpkin pie can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be able to achieve a perfect result every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free pie crust:</strong> The crust is the foundation of your pie, so it's important to choose one that is both tasty and sturdy. You can either make your own or use a trusted store-bought brand.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the filling:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense and heavy pie. Mix the ingredients just until they are combined to ensure a light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the pie cool completely:</strong> Allowing the pie to cool completely before slicing will help the filling set and make it easier to cut clean slices.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with spices:</strong> Feel free to adjust the spices to suit your taste. Some people prefer a stronger cinnamon flavor, while others might enjoy a hint of cloves or allspice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese instead of cream cheese?</h3>
        <p>While cream cheese is the traditional choice for this recipe, you can experiment with other soft cheeses like mascarpone or ricotta. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor of the pie may vary.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this pie dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a dairy-free version of this pie by using dairy-free cream cheese and a plant-based heavy cream alternative. Be sure to check the labels to ensure all ingredients are gluten-free as well.</p>

        <h3>How long can I store the pie?</h3>
        <p>You can store the pie in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. Make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil to keep it fresh.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the pie?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the pie for up to 2 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil before freezing. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>
