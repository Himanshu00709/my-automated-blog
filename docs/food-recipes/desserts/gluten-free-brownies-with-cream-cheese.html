    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line an 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper. This will make it easier to remove the brownies once they're baked.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the unsalted butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense brownies.</p>

    <h3>5. Prepare the Cream Cheese Swirl</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the cream cheese and powdered sugar until smooth. Drop spoonfuls of the cream cheese mixture onto the brownie batter in the pan. Use a knife or toothpick to swirl the cream cheese into the batter, creating a marbled effect.</p>

    <h3>6. Bake and Cool</h3>
    <p>Bake the brownies in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Brownies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to tough brownies. Mix until just combined for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Make sure your butter, eggs, and cream cheese are at room temperature before you start. This ensures a smoother batter and even baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Let Them Cool:</strong> It's tempting to dig in right away, but allowing the brownies to cool completely will make them easier to cut and enhance their flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours like almond flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these brownies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil, and use a dairy-free cream cheese for the swirl.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these brownies?</h3>
        <p>Store the brownies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or chocolate chips?</h3>
        <p>Of course! Feel free to add your favorite mix-ins like chopped nuts, chocolate chips, or even dried fruit to customize your brownies.</p>
