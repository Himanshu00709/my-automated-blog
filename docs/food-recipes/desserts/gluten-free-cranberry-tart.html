    <h1>Gluten-Free Cranberry Tart: A Delicious and Healthy Dessert</h1>
    <p>As the holiday season approaches, many of us are on the lookout for desserts that are not only delicious but also cater to dietary restrictions. One such dessert that has gained popularity in recent years is the gluten-free cranberry tart. This delightful treat combines the tartness of cranberries with the sweetness of a gluten-free crust, making it a perfect addition to any festive table. In this article, we will explore the benefits of a gluten-free diet, the nutritional value of cranberries, and provide a step-by-step guide to creating your own gluten-free cranberry tart.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals looking to improve their overall health. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause digestive issues for some people. By opting for gluten-free desserts, you can enjoy your favorite treats without the discomfort that gluten may cause.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free baking often incorporates alternative flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or rice flour, which can add unique flavors and textures to your desserts. These flours are also often higher in protein and fiber compared to traditional wheat flour, making them a healthier choice.</p>

    <h2>The Nutritional Benefits of Cranberries</h2>
    <p>Cranberries are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. They are rich in vitamins C and E, as well as antioxidants that help protect your body from free radicals. Cranberries are also known for their ability to support urinary tract health and may even have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>

    <p>When used in desserts, cranberries add a burst of flavor and a vibrant color that can make any dish look festive. Their natural tartness pairs beautifully with the sweetness of a gluten-free crust, creating a balanced and satisfying dessert.</p>

    <h2>How to Make a Gluten-Free Cranberry Tart</h2>
    <p>Now that we've covered the benefits of gluten-free baking and the nutritional value of cranberries, let's dive into the recipe for a gluten-free cranberry tart. This recipe is simple to follow and requires only a few ingredients, making it a great option for both novice and experienced bakers.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut flour, and melted butter (or coconut oil). Add the maple syrup and mix until a dough forms. Press the dough into a tart pan, making sure to evenly cover the bottom and sides. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is lightly golden. Allow it to cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a saucepan, combine the fresh cranberries, orange zest, and a splash of water. Cook over medium heat until the cranberries burst and the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Tart:</strong> Pour the cranberry filling into the cooled crust. Spread it evenly and allow it to set in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once set, slice the tart and serve. You can garnish with additional orange zest or a dollop of whipped cream if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen cranberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen cranberries if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw them before cooking, and you may need to adjust the cooking time slightly.</p>
