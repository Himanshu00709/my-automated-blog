    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free apple pie cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, almond flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream together the cold butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Fold in the diced apples.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Apple Pie Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use cold butter:</strong> Cold butter helps create a flaky, tender texture in the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose the right apples:</strong> For the best flavor, use a mix of sweet and tart apples, such as Honeycrisp and Granny Smith.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="faq">
