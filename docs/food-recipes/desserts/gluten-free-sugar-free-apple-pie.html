    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by combining the gluten-free flour blend and almond flour in a large mixing bowl. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Divide the dough into two equal portions, shape them into discs, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, peel, core, and slice the apples into thin slices. In a large bowl, toss the apple slices with the stevia or monk fruit sweetener, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Set aside to allow the flavors to meld.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out one disc of dough on a lightly floured surface to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Carefully transfer the dough to the pie dish and press it gently into the bottom and sides. Add the apple filling, spreading it evenly. Roll out the second disc of dough and place it over the apples. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges to seal. Cut a few small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Pie</h3>
    <p>Place the pie on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. If the edges of the crust begin to brown too quickly, cover them with aluminum foil. Once baked, remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for at least 2 hours before serving.</p>

        <h3>1. Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
