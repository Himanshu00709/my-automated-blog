<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Shortcake</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut flour, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, almond milk, vanilla extract, and stevia or erythritol. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a smooth batter forms.</p>

<p>Pour the batter into a greased 9-inch round cake pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool completely before slicing it into layers.</p>

<h3>2. Preparing the Strawberry Filling</h3>

<p>While the cake is cooling, prepare the strawberry filling. Slice the fresh strawberries and place them in a bowl. If desired, you can sweeten the strawberries with a small amount of stevia or erythritol. Let the strawberries sit for about 15 minutes to release their natural juices.</p>

<h3>3. Whipping the Cream</h3>

<p>In a chilled mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream (or coconut cream) until stiff peaks form. If you prefer a sweeter cream, you can add a small amount of stevia or erythritol to taste. Be careful not to over-whip the cream, as it can become grainy.</p>

<h3>4. Assembling the Shortcake</h3>

<p>Once the cake has cooled, slice it horizontally into two even layers. Place the bottom layer on a serving plate and spread a generous amount of whipped cream over it. Top with a layer of the prepared strawberries. Place the second layer of cake on top and repeat the process with the whipped cream and strawberries. Garnish with additional strawberries if desired.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours such as oat flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different sweetener?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! If you prefer a different sugar-free sweetener, such as monk fruit or xylitol, feel free to substitute it in the same quantity as the stevia or erythritol.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>How should I store the shortcake?</h3>
    <p>Store the assembled shortcake in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 2 days. If you need to store it longer, consider storing the components separately and assembling them just before serving.</p>
</div>

<p>This gluten-free, sugar-free strawberry shortcake is a testament to the fact that dietary restrictions don't have to mean sacrificing flavor or enjoyment. With its moist, tender cake layers, fresh strawberry filling, and luscious whipped cream, this dessert is sure to become a favorite in your household.
