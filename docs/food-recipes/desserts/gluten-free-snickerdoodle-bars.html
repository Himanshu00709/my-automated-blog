    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free snickerdoodle bars:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x9 inch baking pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the eggs and vanilla:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Make sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense bars.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread the batter:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly with a spatula.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the cinnamon-sugar topping:</strong> In a small bowl, mix together the additional sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the top of the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the bars to cool completely in the pan before cutting them into squares. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Snickerdoodle Bars</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free snickerdoodle bars turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough, dense bars. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the bars cool completely:</strong> Gluten-free baked goods can be a bit fragile when warm. Allowing the bars to cool completely will make them easier to cut and serve.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Store the bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Snickerdoodle Bars</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. Almond flour, coconut flour, or oat flour are popular alternatives, but you may need to adjust the quantities and add additional binding agents like xanthan gum.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make these bars dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. Just make sure to use a product that has a similar fat content to ensure the bars have the right texture.</p>

        <h3>3. How do I know when the bars are done baking?</h3>
        <p>The bars are done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with just a few crumbs attached. Be careful not to overbake, as this can dry out the bars.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I freeze these bars?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free snickerdoodle bars freeze well. Wrap them tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and place them in a freezer-safe container. They can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>
