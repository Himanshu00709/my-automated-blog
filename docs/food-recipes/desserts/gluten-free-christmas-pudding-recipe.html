    <h1>Gluten-Free Christmas Pudding Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by gathering all your ingredients. Ensure that your breadcrumbs and flour are certified gluten-free to avoid any cross-contamination. Grate the apple and carrot, and chop the almonds if they aren't already pre-chopped.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free breadcrumbs, gluten-free flour, mixed dried fruit, chopped almonds, dark brown sugar, mixed spice, and cinnamon. Stir well to ensure an even distribution of ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs and melt the butter. Add the grated apple, grated carrot, and brandy (or orange juice) to the wet mixture. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix thoroughly until everything is well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Steam the Pudding</h3>
    <p>Grease a 1.5-liter pudding basin with butter or a dairy-free alternative. Spoon the mixture into the basin, pressing it down firmly. Cover the basin with a double layer of parchment paper and foil, securing it with string. Place the basin in a large pot with enough water to come halfway up the sides of the basin. Cover the pot with a lid and steam the pudding for 4-5 hours, checking occasionally to ensure the water doesn't run dry.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the pudding is cooked, remove it from the pot and let it cool slightly. Turn it out onto a serving plate and serve warm with your choice of custard, cream, or brandy butter. For an extra festive touch, you can flame the pudding with a little warmed brandy before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this pudding ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! In fact, Christmas puddings often taste better when made a few weeks in advance. Store the cooked pudding in a cool, dark place, and reheat it by steaming for an hour before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the gluten-free flour with almond flour or coconut flour, but keep in mind that this may alter the texture slightly. Be sure to adjust the quantity as needed.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can be made vegan by using a dairy-free butter alternative and replacing the eggs with a flaxseed or chia seed egg substitute.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftover pudding can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. Reheat individual portions in the microwave or steam the entire pudding again before serving.</p>
