    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these dry ingredients together until well combined. In a separate bowl, beat the egg and then add the milk and vanilla extract. Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, stirring until the batter is smooth and free of lumps. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Heat the Oil</h3>
    <p>Pour the vegetable oil into a deep skillet or frying pan and heat it over medium-high heat. The oil should reach a temperature of 375°F (190°C). Use a candy thermometer to ensure the oil is at the right temperature. If the oil is too hot, the funnel cakes will burn; if it’s too cool, they’ll absorb too much oil and become greasy.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Fry the Funnel Cakes</h3>
    <p>Once the oil is hot, pour the batter into a funnel or a squeeze bottle with a narrow opening. Hold the funnel or bottle over the oil and drizzle the batter in a circular motion to create a spiral shape. Fry the funnel cake for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to carefully flip the funnel cake and remove it from the oil once it’s cooked.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Dust with Powdered Sugar</h3>
    <p>Place the fried funnel cake on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil. While it’s still warm, generously dust the funnel cake with powdered sugar. Serve immediately for the best taste and texture.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Funnel Cakes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Control the Oil Temperature:</strong> Maintaining the correct oil temperature is crucial for achieving crispy, golden-brown funnel cakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> While powdered sugar is classic, you can also try toppings like cinnamon sugar, chocolate syrup, or fresh fruit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Funnel Cakes</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Simply substitute the milk with a dairy-free alternative like almond milk, oat milk, or coconut milk.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>A gluten-free all-purpose flour blend that includes xanthan gum works best. Popular brands include Bob’s Red Mill and King Arthur Flour.</p>

        <h3>Can I bake the funnel cakes instead of frying them?</h3>
        <p>While frying gives funnel cakes their signature texture, you can try baking them at 375°F (190°C) for a healthier alternative. However, the results may differ slightly.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover funnel cakes?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover funnel cakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. Reheat them in the oven to restore their crispiness.</p>
