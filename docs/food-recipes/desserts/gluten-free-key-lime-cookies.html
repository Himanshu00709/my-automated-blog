<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free key lime cookies.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and make cleanup a breeze.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer on medium speed.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add the Egg and Flavorings</h3>
<p>Beat in the egg, followed by the key lime zest, key lime juice, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined. The zest and juice are what give these cookies their signature tangy flavor, so don't skimp on these ingredients!</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough cookies.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Scoop and Bake</h3>
<p>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers should still be soft.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your gluten-free key lime cookies with a glass of milk or a cup of tea!</p>

</div>

<div class="faq">

    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. Just make sure to use a 1:1 ratio.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
    <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 3 months.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I add a glaze to these cookies?</h3>
    <p>Yes, a simple glaze made with powdered sugar and key lime juice can be drizzled over the cooled cookies for an extra burst of flavor and a touch of sweetness.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free key lime cookies are a delightful treat that combines the tangy zest of key limes with the comforting texture of a soft, chewy cookie.
