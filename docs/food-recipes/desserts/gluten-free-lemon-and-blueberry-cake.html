<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper. This will ensure that your cake doesn't stick to the pan and comes out easily after baking.</p>

<h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

<h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer on medium speed.</p>

<h3>4. Add Eggs and Flavorings</h3>
<p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. The lemon zest and juice will give your cake a refreshing citrus flavor.</p>

<h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake. Finally, fold in the plain yogurt, which will add moisture and richness to the cake.</p>

<h3>6. Fold in Blueberries</h3>
<p>Gently fold in the fresh blueberries. If you're using frozen blueberries, make sure to toss them in a little gluten-free flour before adding them to the batter. This will prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the cake.</p>

<h3>7. Bake the Cake</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The baking time may vary depending on your oven, so keep an eye on the cake during the last few minutes.</p>

<h3>8. Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can dust the cake with powdered sugar or drizzle it with a simple lemon glaze for added sweetness.</p>
