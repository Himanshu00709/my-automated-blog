    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions for making gluten-free Oreo balls:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Crush the Gluten-Free Oreos</h3>
    <p>Begin by placing the gluten-free Oreo cookies in a food processor. Pulse until the cookies are finely crushed. If you don't have a food processor, you can place the cookies in a zip-top bag and crush them using a rolling pin. The goal is to achieve a fine, crumbly texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix with Cream Cheese</h3>
    <p>Transfer the crushed Oreos to a large mixing bowl. Add the softened cream cheese and mix until well combined. The mixture should be thick and hold together when pressed. If it feels too dry, you can add a little more cream cheese, but be careful not to make it too wet.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Form the Balls</h3>
    <p>Using your hands, scoop out small portions of the mixture and roll them into balls about 1 inch in diameter. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Once all the balls are formed, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to firm up.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Melt the White Chocolate</h3>
    <p>While the balls are chilling, melt the white chocolate chips. You can do this using a double boiler or by microwaving the chocolate in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until smooth and fully melted.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Dip the Balls</h3>
    <p>Remove the chilled Oreo balls from the refrigerator. Using a fork or a dipping tool, dip each ball into the melted white chocolate, ensuring it's fully coated. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off before placing the ball back on the parchment paper. If desired, you can sprinkle the balls with sprinkles or crushed nuts while the chocolate is still wet.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once all the balls are coated, return the baking sheet to the refrigerator for another 15-20 minutes to allow the chocolate to set. Once set, your gluten-free Oreo balls are ready to serve! Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</p>

    <h2>Tips and Variations</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips and variations to help you customize your gluten-free Oreo balls:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Dark Chocolate:</strong> If you prefer a richer flavor, you can use dark chocolate instead of white chocolate for coating.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Extracts:</strong> For an extra layer of flavor, consider adding a teaspoon of vanilla or almond extract to the Oreo and cream cheese mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Them Vegan:</strong> To make vegan gluten-free Oreo balls, use vegan cream cheese and dairy-free chocolate.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> Get creative with your toppings! Try crushed nuts, shredded coconut, or even a drizzle of caramel sauce.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        
        <h3>Can I use regular Oreos if I don't need a gluten-free option?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can absolutely use regular Oreos if you don't need a gluten-free option. The recipe will work just the same, and the taste will be equally delicious.</p>

        <h3>How long do gluten-free Oreo balls last?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free Oreo balls can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week. If you want to keep them longer, you can freeze them for up to two months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free Oreo balls are a great make-ahead dessert. You can prepare them a day or two in advance and store them in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of cookie?</h3>
        <p>While this recipe is specifically designed for Oreo cookies, you can experiment with other gluten-free cookies. Just make sure the cookies have a similar texture to Oreos for the best results.</p>
