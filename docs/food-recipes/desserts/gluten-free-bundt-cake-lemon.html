    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create a gluten-free lemon bundt cake that’s sure to impress:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease your bundt pan thoroughly with butter or a non-stick spray, making sure to get into all the crevices to ensure your cake releases easily after baking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Eggs and Flavorings</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. The mixture should be smooth and well-combined.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cake. Finally, fold in the Greek yogurt until the batter is smooth and uniform.</p>

    <h3>6. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared bundt pan, spreading it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>7. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 15 minutes before inverting it onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can dust it with powdered sugar or drizzle it with a lemon glaze for extra flavor.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Lemon Bundt Cake</h2>
    <p>Baking a gluten-free cake can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be well on your way to success:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Grease Your Pan Well:</strong> Bundt pans have intricate designs, so make sure to grease every nook and cranny to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Cake Cool Completely:</strong> Allowing the cake to cool completely before slicing will help it hold its shape and make it easier to cut.</li>
    </ul>
