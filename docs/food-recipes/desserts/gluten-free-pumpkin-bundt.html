<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making your gluten-free pumpkin bundt cake:</p>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease your bundt pan thoroughly with butter or non-stick spray, making sure to get into all the crevices. Dust the pan with a light coating of gluten-free flour to ensure the cake releases easily after baking.</p>

<h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. This ensures that the spices are evenly distributed throughout the cake.</p>

<h3>3. Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract until well combined. The mixture should be smooth and slightly thick.</p>

<h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cake. The batter should be thick but pourable.</p>

<h3>5. Bake the Cake</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared bundt pan, spreading it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The cake should be golden brown and spring back when lightly touched.</p>

<h3>6. Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 15 minutes before inverting it onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can dust the cake with powdered sugar or drizzle it with a simple glaze made from powdered sugar and milk.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free as well?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can easily make this cake dairy-free by using a dairy-free butter substitute for greasing the pan and ensuring that any additional toppings or glazes are also dairy-free.</p>

    <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! If you prefer to use fresh pumpkin, simply roast or steam the pumpkin until tender, then puree it in a blender or food processor. Make sure to strain any excess water to achieve the right consistency.</p>

    <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
    <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months. Be sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil before freezing.</p>

    <h3>Can I add nuts or chocolate chips to the batter?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can customize your cake by adding chopped nuts, such as pecans or walnuts, or even chocolate chips. Fold them into the batter just before pouring it into the pan.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The gluten-free pumpkin bundt cake is a delightful way to embrace the flavors of fall while catering to dietary restrictions.
