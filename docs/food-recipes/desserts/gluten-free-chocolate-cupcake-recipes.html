    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a cupcake tin with paper liners.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the melted butter and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Add the milk (or dairy-free alternative) and stir until the batter is smooth.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly among the cupcake liners, filling each about two-thirds full.</li>
        <li>Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the cupcakes to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cupcakes</h2>

    <p>Baking gluten-free cupcakes can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to achieve perfect results every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Almond flour works well for a moist and tender crumb, but you can also experiment with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or a gluten-free flour blend.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to dense cupcakes. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free cupcakes can bake faster than traditional ones, so keep an eye on them and check for doneness a few minutes before the recommended baking time.</li>
        <li><strong>Let Them Cool:</strong> Allow the cupcakes to cool completely before frosting. This will prevent the frosting from melting and ensure a smooth finish.</li>
    </ul>
