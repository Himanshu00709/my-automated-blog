<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Monster Cookies</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free monster cookies is a straightforward process that anyone can master. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create these delicious treats:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter, melted butter or coconut oil, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined and smooth.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free oats, gluten-free flour, and baking soda. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Fold in the Mix-Ins</h3>
<p>Gently fold in the chocolate chips and gluten-free M&M's until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Scoop and Bake</h3>
<p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden but the centers are still soft.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free monster cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Monster Cookies</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Are all oats gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>While oats are naturally gluten-free, they are often processed in facilities that also handle wheat, barley, and rye, which can lead to cross-contamination. To ensure your oats are gluten-free, look for packages labeled "certified gluten-free."</p>

    <h3>2. Can I use a different nut butter instead of peanut butter?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute peanut butter with almond butter, cashew butter, or any other nut butter of your choice. Just keep in mind that the flavor will vary slightly depending on the nut butter you use.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make vegan gluten-free monster cookies by using a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of a regular egg, and by using dairy-free chocolate chips and M&M's.</p>

    <h3>4. How should I store gluten-free monster cookies?</h3>
    <p>Store your gluten-free monster cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months. Simply thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>

    <h3>5. Can I add other mix-ins to the cookies?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Feel free to get creative with your mix-ins. Some popular additions include dried fruit, nuts, or even white chocolate chips. Just make sure any additional ingredients are gluten-free.</p>
