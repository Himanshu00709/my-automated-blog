    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease a donut pan with coconut oil or a non-stick cooking spray to ensure your donuts don’t stick to the pan.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make sure all the dry ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in your batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, maple syrup (or honey), and melted coconut oil. Ensure the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the donuts dense. If you’re using chocolate chips, fold them into the batter at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fill the Donut Pan</h3>
    <p>Using a piping bag or a spoon, carefully fill each cavity of the donut pan about two-thirds full with the batter. This will allow the donuts to rise evenly without overflowing.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the donut pan in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into a donut comes out clean. Be careful not to overbake, as gluten-free baked goods can dry out quickly.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Decorate</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the donuts from the oven and let them cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. You can enjoy them as is, or drizzle them with melted dark chocolate or a simple glaze made from powdered sugar and milk.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chocolate Donuts</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours like almond flour, oat flour, or a pre-made gluten-free flour blend. However, the texture and taste may vary slightly depending on the flour you choose.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these donuts vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make these donuts vegan, replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and use a non-dairy milk like almond or oat milk.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store these donuts?</h3>
        <p>Store the donuts in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze them for up to 2 months.</p>
    </div>
