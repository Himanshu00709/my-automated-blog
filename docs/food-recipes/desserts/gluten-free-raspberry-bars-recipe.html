<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line an 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang on the sides for easy removal later.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Crust</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to mix the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Press the Crust into the Pan</h3>
<p>Reserve about 1 cup of the crumb mixture for the topping. Press the remaining mixture evenly into the bottom of the prepared baking pan. Use the back of a spoon or your fingers to press it down firmly.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add the Raspberry Filling</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, mix the raspberry jam and fresh raspberries together. Spread this mixture evenly over the crust in the pan.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Add the Topping</h3>
<p>Sprinkle the reserved crumb mixture evenly over the raspberry filling. Press it down lightly to ensure it sticks to the filling.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake the Bars</h3>
<p>Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Remove from the oven and let the bars cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Raspberry Bars</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Cold Butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for achieving a crumbly texture in the crust and topping. If the butter is too soft, the mixture will become too dense.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> When combining the butter with the dry ingredients, be careful not to overmix. You want the mixture to remain crumbly, not form a dough.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the Bars Cool:</strong> It’s important to let the bars cool completely before cutting them. This will help them set and make them easier to slice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen raspberries instead of fresh?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen raspberries if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them well before using to avoid excess moisture in the filling.</p>

    <h3>Can I substitute the almond flour?</h3>
    <p>If you have a nut allergy, you can substitute almond flour with an equal amount of gluten-free oat flour or additional gluten-free all-purpose flour.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these bars?</h3>
    <p>Store the gluten-free raspberry bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a different type of jam?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! While raspberry jam is recommended for this recipe, you can experiment with other flavors like strawberry, blackberry, or even apricot jam.</p>
