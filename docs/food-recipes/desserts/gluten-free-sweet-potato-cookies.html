    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free sweet potato cookies is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create a batch of delicious, healthy cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the sweet potato puree:</strong> If you don't have pre-made sweet potato puree, you can make your own by boiling or roasting sweet potatoes until tender, then mashing them until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the wet ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the sweet potato puree, coconut sugar, melted coconut oil, egg, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the add-ins:</strong> If you're using any optional add-ins like chocolate chips or nuts, fold them into the dough at this stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Flatten them slightly with the back of a spoon or your fingers. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free sweet potato cookies with a glass of milk or a cup of tea!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free sweet potato cookies are not just delicious; they're also packed with nutritional benefits. Sweet potatoes are an excellent source of beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A, essential for eye health and immune function. The fiber in sweet potatoes aids in digestion and helps maintain stable blood sugar levels. Additionally, using gluten-free flour and natural sweeteners like coconut sugar makes these cookies a healthier alternative to traditional baked goods.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
