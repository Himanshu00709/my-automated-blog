    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free funfetti cupcakes is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a batch of delicious, festive cupcakes:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cupcakes bake evenly and rise properly.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare Your Cupcake Liners</h3>
    <p>Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners. This prevents the cupcakes from sticking and makes for easy cleanup.</p>

    <h3>3. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, baking powder, and salt. This ensures that the dry ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter (or oil), eggs, milk, and vanilla extract. This creates a smooth, well-combined wet mixture.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense cupcakes.</p>

    <h3>6. Add the Sprinkles</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the gluten-free sprinkles. This ensures that the sprinkles are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

    <h3>7. Fill the Cupcake Liners</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or ice cream scoop, fill each cupcake liner about two-thirds full. This allows room for the cupcakes to rise without overflowing.</p>

    <h3>8. Bake the Cupcakes</h3>
    <p>Bake the cupcakes in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>9. Cool and Frost</h3>
    <p>Allow the cupcakes to cool completely before frosting. You can use your favorite gluten-free frosting recipe or a store-bought gluten-free frosting.</p>
