    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular, not just for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but for anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake. Gluten-free flours, such as almond flour and gluten-free blends, offer a lighter texture and a nuttier flavor compared to traditional wheat flour. Additionally, gluten-free baking can be more nutrient-dense, as many gluten-free flours are made from whole grains, nuts, and seeds.</p>
