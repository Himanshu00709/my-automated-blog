<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free brownie cupcakes:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter (or coconut oil), eggs, and vanilla extract.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips if using.</li>
    <li><strong>Fill the Muffin Tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 2/3 full.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the cupcakes to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Brownie Cupcakes</h2>

<p>Here are some expert tips to ensure your gluten-free brownie cupcakes turn out perfectly every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> This helps the ingredients blend more smoothly, resulting in a better texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cupcakes. Mix until just combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free baked goods can be tricky. Use a toothpick to check for doneness—it should come out with a few moist crumbs, not wet batter.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> Add a dollop of whipped cream, a drizzle of caramel, or a sprinkle of sea salt for extra flair.</li>
</ul>
