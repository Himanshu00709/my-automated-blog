    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious brownies:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper. This will make it easier to remove the brownies later.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Blend the Avocados</h3>
    <p>In a food processor or blender, combine the ripe avocados, eggs, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Blend until smooth and creamy. This mixture will serve as the base of your brownie batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder. Ensure there are no lumps for a smooth batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the avocado mixture, stirring until well combined. Fold in the dark chocolate chips for an extra layer of indulgence.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Be careful not to overbake, as this can dry out the brownies.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the brownies to cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack. Once completely cooled, cut into squares and serve. Enjoy!</p>
