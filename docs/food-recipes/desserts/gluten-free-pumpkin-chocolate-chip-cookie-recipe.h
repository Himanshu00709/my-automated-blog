    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create your gluten-free pumpkin chocolate chip cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, salt, and pumpkin pie spice. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugars:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the wet ingredients:</strong> Beat in the pumpkin puree, egg, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the chocolate chips:</strong> Gently fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop the dough:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may still look slightly underbaked, but they will firm up as they cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be well on your way to cookie perfection:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined to ensure a tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough:</strong> If your dough is too sticky, chilling it for 30 minutes can make it easier to handle and help the cookies hold their shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with add-ins:</strong> Feel free to get creative with your add-ins. Nuts, dried fruit, or even white chocolate chips can be delicious alternatives to chocolate chips.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the cookies to be gluten-free. However, the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. Just make sure to use dairy-free chocolate chips as well.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of pumpkin puree?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh pumpkin puree. Just make sure it's well-drained and has a similar consistency to canned pumpkin puree.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>These gluten-free pumpkin chocolate chip cookies are the perfect treat to enjoy during the fall season. With their warm, spiced flavor and rich chocolatey goodness, they're sure to be a hit with everyone, whether they're gluten-free or not.
