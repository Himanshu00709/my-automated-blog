    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free vegan rum balls is surprisingly simple. Follow these steps to create your own batch:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, vegan butter, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract. Mix until the ingredients are well combined. The dough should be thick and slightly sticky.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Rum</h3>

    <p>Gradually add the dark rum to the dough, mixing as you go. Start with 2 tablespoons and add more if needed. The dough should be moist but not too wet. If it becomes too sticky, you can add a bit more flour.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Form the Balls</h3>

    <p>Using your hands, roll the dough into small, bite-sized balls. Aim for about 1 inch in diameter. If the dough is too sticky, you can lightly dust your hands with powdered sugar to make rolling easier.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Coat with Coconut</h3>

    <p>Place the shredded coconut in a shallow bowl. Roll each rum ball in the coconut until it’s evenly coated. You can also use cocoa powder or crushed nuts for a different coating.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Chill and Serve</h3>

    <p>Place the rum balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to firm up. Once chilled, they’re ready to serve! Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</p>

        <p>Yes, you can make non-alcoholic rum balls by substituting the rum with rum extract or a combination of vanilla extract and almond extract. The flavor will be slightly different, but still delicious.</p>
