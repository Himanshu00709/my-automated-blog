    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Cake Batter</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the Betty Crocker Gluten-Free Chocolate Cake Mix, eggs, water, and vegetable oil. Mix until the batter is smooth and well-combined. Pour the batter into two greased 9-inch round cake pans.</p>

    <h3>2. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Place the cake pans in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>3. Make the Coconut-Pecan Frosting</h3>
    <p>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the frosting. In a medium saucepan, combine the evaporated milk, granulated sugar, egg yolks, and butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens (about 12 minutes). Remove from heat and stir in the shredded coconut, chopped pecans, and vanilla extract. Let the frosting cool to room temperature.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Cake</h3>
    <p>Once the cakes and frosting are completely cooled, place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread a generous amount of the coconut-pecan frosting over the top. Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. For an extra touch, you can drizzle melted chocolate over the top of the cake.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free German Chocolate Cake</h2>
    <p>While this cake is undoubtedly a treat, it does offer some nutritional benefits, especially when made with gluten-free ingredients. Gluten-free flours, such as those used in Betty Crocker’s mix, are often made from nutrient-dense grains like rice, almond, or coconut flour. These flours can provide additional fiber, protein, and healthy fats compared to traditional wheat flour. Additionally, the coconut and pecans in the frosting add healthy fats and essential minerals like magnesium and zinc.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different gluten-free cake mix?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free chocolate cake mix if you prefer. However, Betty Crocker’s mix is specifically formulated to provide a moist and fluffy texture, which works exceptionally well for this recipe.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter and evaporated milk with dairy-free alternatives like coconut oil and coconut milk. Ensure that all other ingredients, such as the cake mix, are also dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, refrigerate the cake for up to 5 days. Allow it to come to room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I freeze the cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cake for up to 3 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. Thaw the cake in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>
