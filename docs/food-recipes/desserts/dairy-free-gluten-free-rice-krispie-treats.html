    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare Your Ingredients:</strong> Measure out all your ingredients before you start. This will make the process smoother and ensure you don’t miss anything.</li>
        <li><strong>Melt the Margarine or Coconut Oil:</strong> In a large pot, melt the dairy-free margarine or coconut oil over low heat. Be careful not to let it burn.</li>
