    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the baking process:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugars:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the egg and vanilla:</strong> Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the chocolate:</strong> Gently fold in the semi-sweet chocolate chips and dark chocolate chunks.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop the dough:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft. The cookies will continue to cook slightly on the baking sheet after you remove them from the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Double Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use high-quality gluten-free flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined to keep them tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough:</strong> If you have time, chilling the dough for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with chocolate:</strong> Feel free to mix and match different types of chocolate chips and chunks to suit your taste.</li>
    </ul>
