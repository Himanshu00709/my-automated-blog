    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions for making gluten-free donut holes.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, salt, and granulated sugar. Mix these dry ingredients thoroughly to ensure even distribution. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a soft dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the dough tough.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Shape the Donut Holes</h3>
    <p>Once the dough is ready, use a small cookie scoop or a tablespoon to portion out the dough. Roll each portion into a small ball, about 1 inch in diameter. Place the dough balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. This will make it easier to handle them when it’s time to fry.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Fry the Donut Holes</h3>
    <p>Heat the vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or a deep fryer to 350°F (175°C). Carefully drop a few dough balls into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry the donut holes for about 2-3 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Coat with Powdered Sugar</h3>
    <p>While the donut holes are still warm, roll them in powdered sugar until they are fully coated. You can also use cinnamon sugar or a glaze if you prefer a different flavor. Allow the donut holes to cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Donut Holes</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free donut holes can be a bit tricky, especially if you’re new to gluten-free baking. Here are some tips to help you achieve the best results:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right combination of flours and starches to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough donut holes. Mix the dough just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor the oil temperature:</strong> If the oil is too hot, the donut holes will brown too quickly on the outside while remaining undercooked on the inside. If the oil is too cool, the donut holes will absorb too much oil and become greasy.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with coatings:</strong> While powdered sugar is a classic choice, don’t be afraid to get creative with your coatings. Try cinnamon sugar, a chocolate glaze, or even a drizzle of caramel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Donut Holes</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I bake these donut holes instead of frying them?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake gluten-free donut holes if you prefer a healthier option. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and bake the donut holes on a parchment-lined baking sheet for about 10-12 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Keep in mind that baked donut holes will have a slightly different texture than fried ones.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these donut holes ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. When you’re ready to fry the donut holes, simply shape the dough into balls and proceed with the recipe. You can also store the cooked donut holes in an airtight container for up to 2 days, though they are best enjoyed fresh.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of powdered sugar for coating?</h3>
        <p>If you’re looking for an alternative to powdered sugar, you can use cinnamon sugar, a glaze made with powdered sugar and milk, or even a chocolate coating. The possibilities are endless, so feel free to get creative!</p>
