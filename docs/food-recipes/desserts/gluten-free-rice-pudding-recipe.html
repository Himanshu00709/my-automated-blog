    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free rice pudding:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Rice:</strong> In a medium saucepan, combine the gluten-free white rice and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Milk:</strong> Once the rice is cooked, add the milk to the saucepan. Stir well to combine. Increase the heat to medium and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweeten the Pudding:</strong> Add the granulated sugar, vanilla extract, ground cinnamon, and salt to the saucepan. Stir continuously to ensure the sugar dissolves and the ingredients are well incorporated.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer and Thicken:</strong> Allow the mixture to simmer for about 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. The pudding will thicken as it cooks. If you prefer a thicker consistency, you can simmer it for a few additional minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Optional Ingredients:</strong> If you're using raisins or other dried fruits, stir them in during the last 5 minutes of cooking. This will allow them to plump up and add a burst of flavor to your pudding.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Once the pudding has reached your desired consistency, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly. Serve warm or chilled, depending on your preference.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Rice Pudding</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free rice pudding turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Rice:</strong> Use a short-grain or medium-grain rice for the best texture. Arborio rice, often used in risotto, is an excellent choice for a creamier pudding.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor the Heat:</strong> Keep the heat at a gentle simmer to prevent the milk from scorching. Stirring occasionally will also help prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize the Flavor:</strong> Feel free to experiment with different flavorings. Nutmeg, cardamom, or even a splash of almond extract can add a unique twist to your pudding.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave, adding a splash of milk if needed to restore the creamy texture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Rice Pudding</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use brown rice instead of white rice?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use brown rice, but keep in mind that it will take longer to cook and may result in a slightly chewier texture. Adjust the cooking time accordingly and add more liquid if needed.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the dairy milk with a non-dairy alternative such as almond milk, coconut milk, or oat milk. Ensure that the sugar you use is also vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe in a slow cooker?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make gluten-free rice pudding in a slow cooker. Combine all the ingredients in the slow cooker and cook on low for 4-6 hours, stirring occasionally. This method is great for a hands-off approach.</p>

        <h3>How can I make the pudding thicker?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer a thicker pudding, you can simmer it for a few extra minutes or add a cornstarch slurry (1 tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons of cold water) during the last few minutes of cooking.</p>
    </div>
