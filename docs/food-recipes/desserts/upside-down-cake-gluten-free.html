    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making a Gluten-Free Upside Down Cake</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free upside down cake is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a show-stopping dessert that everyone will love:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Topping</h3>
    <p>Start by melting butter in a cake pan and sprinkling it with sugar. Arrange your chosen fruits in a decorative pattern on top of the sugar. This will become the caramelized topping once the cake is flipped.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Batter</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine your gluten-free flour blend, sugar, eggs, and any additional flavorings (like vanilla extract or spices). Mix until smooth, then pour the batter over the prepared fruit topping.</p>

    <h3>3. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Bake the cake in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The baking time will vary depending on the size of your pan and the type of fruit used.</p>

    <h3>4. Flip and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the cake is done, let it cool for a few minutes before carefully flipping it onto a serving plate. The caramelized fruit topping will now be on top, creating a beautiful and delicious presentation.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>Here are some additional tips to ensure your gluten-free upside down cake turns out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Fruits:</strong> Fresh fruits will caramelize better than canned or frozen ones, though canned pineapple is a classic choice.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Cake Cool Slightly Before Flipping:</strong> This helps the cake set and prevents it from falling apart when flipped.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Try adding spices like cinnamon or nutmeg, or use different fruits like peaches or pears for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Upside Down Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use any gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, but it’s best to use a blend that includes xanthan gum, as it helps mimic the elasticity of gluten. Popular options include almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour blends.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a plant-based milk if needed.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze it for longer storage.</p>

        <h3>Can I use frozen fruits?</h3>
        <p>While fresh fruits are preferred, you can use frozen fruits if necessary. Just make sure to thaw and drain them well to avoid excess moisture in the cake.</p>
