    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make these delicious gluten-free, sugar-free brownies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your brownies bake evenly and develop a perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Baking Pan</h3>
    <p>Line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper or lightly grease it with a non-stick cooking spray. This will prevent the brownies from sticking to the pan and make them easier to remove after baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, cocoa powder, erythritol, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these ingredients together until they are well combined and free of lumps.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, unsweetened applesauce, and vanilla extract. Once combined, pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until a smooth batter forms. If you're using sugar-free dark chocolate chips, fold them into the batter at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Brownies</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly with a spatula. Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Be careful not to overbake, as this can result in dry brownies.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the brownies from the oven and let them cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely before cutting into squares. Serve and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different flour instead of almond flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and moisture content may vary, so you may need to adjust the quantity of wet ingredients accordingly.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of erythritol?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have erythritol, you can use other sugar substitutes like stevia, monk fruit sweetener, or xylitol. Be sure to follow the conversion guidelines on the packaging, as some sweeteners are sweeter than others.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these brownies vegan?</h3>
        <p>To make these brownies vegan, you can replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg). Additionally, ensure that the chocolate chips you use are vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these brownies?</h3>
        <p>Store the brownies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for longer storage—just wrap them individually in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe bag.</p>
