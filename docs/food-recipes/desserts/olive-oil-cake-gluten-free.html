    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create a delicious gluten-free olive oil cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch round cake pan with olive oil or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the olive oil and sugar until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the milk, vanilla extract, and lemon zest.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Olive Oil Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use any type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend, but for the best texture, a combination of rice flour, almond flour, and tapioca starch works well. Avoid using only almond flour, as it can make the cake too dense.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I substitute the olive oil with another oil?</h3>
        <p>While olive oil provides a unique flavor, you can substitute it with other mild-flavored oils like avocado oil or coconut oil. However, the taste will be slightly different.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly and refrigerate for up to a week, or freeze for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>4. Is this cake suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe contains eggs, so it is not vegan. However, you can experiment with egg substitutes like flax eggs or chia eggs to make a vegan version.</p>
