    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the recipe. Follow these steps to create the perfect gluten-free dairy-free snickerdoodles:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This ensures your cookies won’t stick and makes cleanup a breeze.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the dairy-free butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs or egg replacer and mix until well combined. Gradually add the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Mix until a soft dough forms.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Roll and Coat</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine cinnamon and sugar. Scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of dough, roll them into balls, and coat them generously in the cinnamon-sugar mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the coated dough balls on the prepared baking sheet, leaving enough space between them to spread. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Snickerdoodles</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free and dairy-free cookies can be tricky, but these tips will help you achieve the best results:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before rolling.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add a pinch of nutmeg or cardamom to the cinnamon-sugar coating for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Snickerdoodles</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I Freeze the Dough?</h3>
        <p>Yes! You can freeze the dough for up to 3 months. Simply roll the dough into balls, coat them in cinnamon-sugar, and place them on a baking sheet in the freezer. Once frozen, transfer the dough balls to a zip-top bag. Bake directly from frozen, adding a couple of extra minutes to the baking time.</p>

        <h3>Are These Cookies Vegan?</h3>
        <p>If you use an egg replacer and ensure your sugar is vegan-friendly, these cookies can be made vegan. Check the labels on your ingredients to confirm they meet your dietary requirements.</p>

        <h3>Can I Use Coconut Flour?</h3>
        <p>Coconut flour is highly absorbent and requires more liquid than other gluten-free flours. If you want to use coconut flour, you’ll need to adjust the recipe by adding more eggs or egg replacer and possibly some additional liquid.</p>

        <h3>How Do I Store These Cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze the baked cookies for up to 2 months.</p>

With the right ingredients and a little patience, you can create cookies that are just as soft, chewy, and flavorful as the traditional version. Whether you’re baking for yourself, a loved one, or a crowd, these allergy-friendly snickerdoodles are sure to be a hit.
