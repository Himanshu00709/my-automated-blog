    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish and set it aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set this dry mixture aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer on medium speed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract. The mixture should be smooth and well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the whole milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool completely in the pan.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Prepare the Tres Leches Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and ½ cup of the heavy cream. Once the cake has cooled, use a fork or skewer to poke holes all over the surface of the cake. Slowly pour the tres leches mixture over the cake, allowing it to soak in.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Whip the Cream Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whip the remaining ½ cup of heavy cream with the powdered sugar until stiff peaks form. Spread the whipped cream over the top of the soaked cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Refrigerate the cake for at least 2 hours, or overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the cake to fully absorb the tres leches mixture. Serve chilled and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. Just make sure it’s a 1:1 substitute for all-purpose flour to ensure the right texture.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How long does the cake last in the fridge?</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a dairy-free version by using dairy-free alternatives for the milk, evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and heavy cream. However, the flavor and texture may vary slightly.</p>
    </div>
