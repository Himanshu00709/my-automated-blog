<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that we have all the ingredients, let’s walk through the process of making this delightful dessert.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>

<p>Start by crushing the gluten-free graham crackers into fine crumbs. You can use a food processor or place them in a zip-top bag and crush them with a rolling pin. Mix the crumbs with melted butter until they are well combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of each jar, creating an even layer. Place the jars in the refrigerator to set while you prepare the filling.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Make the Cheesecake Filling</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until it’s smooth and creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract, continuing to beat until fully incorporated. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until smooth and well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble the Cheesecake</h3>

<p>Remove the jars from the refrigerator and spoon the cheesecake filling over the crust, filling each jar about three-quarters full. Smooth the top with a spatula or the back of a spoon. Add your choice of fresh berries or fruit on top for a burst of color and flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Chill and Serve</h3>

<p>Place the jars back in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to allow the cheesecake to set. Once chilled, they are ready to serve! Enjoy your gluten-free no-bake cheesecake in a jar straight from the fridge.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
