<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Dough</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the softened cream cheese and butter. Beat them together until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined.</p>

<h3>2. Mixing the Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until a soft dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense cookies.</p>

<h3>3. Shaping the Cookies</h3>

<p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded portions of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Space the cookies about 2 inches apart to allow for spreading. If desired, you can flatten the cookies slightly with the back of a spoon or your fingers.</p>

<h3>4. Baking the Cookies</h3>

<p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers should still be soft. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cream Cheese Cookies</h2>

<p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free cream cheese cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best results.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill the dough if necessary:</strong> If the dough is too soft to handle, you can chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before shaping the cookies.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Feel free to add your favorite mix-ins, such as chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruit, to customize the cookies to your taste.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cream Cheese Cookies</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the cookies to be gluten-free. However, the texture and taste may differ slightly from the gluten-free version.</p>

    <h3>2. How should I store gluten-free cream cheese cookies?</h3>
    <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 2 months.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute the cream cheese and butter with dairy-free alternatives. However, the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>4. Are these cookies suitable for people with celiac disease?</h3>
