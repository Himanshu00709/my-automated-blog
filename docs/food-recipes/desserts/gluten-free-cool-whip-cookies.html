    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free Cool Whip cookies is a breeze. Follow these simple steps to create your own batch of delicious cookies:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly and come out perfectly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free cake mix, Cool Whip, and egg. Mix until well combined. The dough will be sticky, but that’s normal.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll the dough:</strong> Using a spoon or a cookie scoop, drop small portions of the dough into a bowl of powdered sugar. Roll the dough balls in the sugar until they are fully coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the cookies:</strong> Place the coated dough balls onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free Cool Whip cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cool Whip Cookies</h2>

    <p>While the recipe is straightforward, here are a few tips to ensure your cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use room temperature ingredients:</strong> Make sure your Cool Whip and egg are at room temperature before mixing. This helps the ingredients combine more easily and results in a smoother dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Feel free to experiment with different gluten-free cake mix flavors. Lemon, vanilla, and chocolate are all great options.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> These cookies are best enjoyed fresh, but they can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days. You can also freeze the dough for later use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cool Whip Cookies</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use homemade Cool Whip instead of store-bought?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use homemade Cool Whip if you prefer. However, store-bought Cool Whip is more convenient and works just as well in this recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these cookies dairy-free by using a dairy-free whipped topping instead of Cool Whip. Just make sure to check the labels to ensure all ingredients are gluten-free and dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>Can I add mix-ins to the dough?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can add gluten-free chocolate chips, sprinkles, or even nuts to the dough for extra flavor and texture.</p>

        <h3>How do I know when the cookies are done baking?</h3>
        <p>The cookies are done when the edges are lightly golden and the tops are set. They will continue to firm up as they cool, so it’s okay if they seem a bit soft when you take them out of the oven.</p>
