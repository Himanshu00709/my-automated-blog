        <li><strong>Pour the brownie batter:</strong> Carefully pour the brownie batter over the Oreo layer, making sure to cover all the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.</li>
