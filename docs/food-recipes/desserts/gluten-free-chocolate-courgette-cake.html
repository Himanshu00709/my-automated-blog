    <h1>Gluten-Free Chocolate Courgette Cake: A Healthy Indulgence</h1>

    <p>When it comes to baking, finding the perfect balance between indulgence and health can be a challenge. Enter the gluten-free chocolate courgette cake—a moist, decadent dessert that not only satisfies your sweet tooth but also sneaks in a serving of vegetables. This cake is a testament to the fact that healthy eating doesn’t have to mean sacrificing flavor. Whether you’re gluten-intolerant, health-conscious, or simply looking for a new baking adventure, this cake is sure to impress.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Chocolate Courgette Cake?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking has gained immense popularity over the years, and for good reason. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, avoiding gluten is essential for maintaining good health. But even for those without gluten issues, reducing gluten intake can lead to improved digestion and overall well-being. Adding courgette (zucchini) to the mix not only enhances the cake’s moisture but also boosts its nutritional profile. Courgettes are low in calories, high in fiber, and packed with vitamins and minerals, making this cake a guilt-free treat.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Courgette</h3>
    <p>Start by grating the courgette. Once grated, place it in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much moisture as possible. This step is crucial to prevent the cake from becoming too wet.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure they are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, melted coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Once well combined, fold in the grated courgette.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into a greased cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and serve. For an extra touch, you can dust the cake with powdered sugar or drizzle it with a chocolate glaze.</p>
