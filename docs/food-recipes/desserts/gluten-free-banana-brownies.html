    <h1>Gluten-Free Banana Brownies: A Healthy Indulgence</h1>
    <p>For those who love the rich, fudgy texture of brownies but are looking for a healthier, gluten-free alternative, gluten-free banana brownies are the perfect treat. Combining the natural sweetness of bananas with the decadence of chocolate, these brownies are not only delicious but also cater to dietary restrictions. Whether you're gluten-intolerant, health-conscious, or simply looking to try something new, this recipe is a must-try.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Banana Brownies?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity over the years, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals seeking healthier eating habits. Traditional brownies are typically made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. By substituting gluten-free flour and adding bananas, you not only eliminate gluten but also introduce a natural sweetness and moisture that enhances the texture and flavor of the brownies.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking pan with butter or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mash the Bananas</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more flavorful your brownies will be.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add the melted unsalted butter (or coconut oil), eggs, and vanilla extract to the mashed bananas. Mix well until all ingredients are fully combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. Ensure there are no lumps in the mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense brownies. If desired, fold in the dark chocolate chips for an extra chocolatey touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the brownies to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Cut into squares and serve.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free banana brownies are not only delicious but also offer several nutritional benefits. Bananas are a great source of potassium, vitamin C, and dietary fiber. Using gluten-free flour can make these brownies easier to digest for those with gluten sensitivities. Additionally, dark chocolate chips add antioxidants, which are beneficial for heart health.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, almond flour can be used as a substitute for gluten-free flour. However, keep in mind that almond flour has a different texture and may require adjustments in the quantity of other ingredients.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these brownies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make vegan gluten-free banana brownies, replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and use coconut oil instead of butter.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these brownies?</h3>
        <p>Store the brownies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate them for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts to the recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, adding nuts like walnuts or pecans can add a delightful crunch and extra flavor to your brownies. Simply fold them into the batter before baking.</p>
    </div>
