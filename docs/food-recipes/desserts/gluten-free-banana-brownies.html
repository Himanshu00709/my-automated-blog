<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Banana Brownies</h2>

<p>Now that you know the key ingredients, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free banana brownies.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper. This will prevent the brownies from sticking and make it easier to remove them from the pan.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mash the Bananas</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, mash 2-3 ripe bananas until smooth. The riper the bananas, the sweeter your brownies will be. If you prefer a chunkier texture, you can leave some small banana pieces.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>Add 2 eggs, 1/4 cup of melted coconut oil, 1/4 cup of maple syrup, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the mashed bananas. Mix well until all the ingredients are fully combined.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together 1 cup of almond flour, 1/2 cup of cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Make sure there are no lumps in the dry ingredients.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the brownies dense.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake the Brownies</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the brownies to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, cut into squares and serve.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Banana Brownies</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different flour instead of almond flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I make these brownies vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons of water per egg) and use a plant-based sweetener like agave syrup instead of maple syrup.</p>

    <h3>3. How should I store the brownies?</h3>
    <p>Store the brownies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I add nuts or chocolate chips to the brownies?</h3>
    <p>Yes, feel free to add your favorite mix-ins like chopped nuts, chocolate chips, or even dried fruit for extra texture and flavor.</p>
