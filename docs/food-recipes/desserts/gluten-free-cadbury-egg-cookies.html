<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get baking! Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free Cadbury egg cookies:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and make cleanup a breeze.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, and salt. Set this mixture aside for now.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugars</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Egg and Vanilla</h3>
<p>Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined. Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure everything is evenly mixed.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough cookies.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Fold in Cadbury Eggs</h3>
<p>Gently fold in the crushed Cadbury Mini Eggs. You can crush them by placing them in a zip-top bag and using a rolling pin to break them into smaller pieces.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Scoop and Bake</h3>
<p>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</p>

<h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your delicious gluten-free Cadbury egg cookies!</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>

<p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be a pro in no time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky, chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before scooping and baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to add other mix-ins like chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruit to customize your cookies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cadbury Egg Cookies</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the cookies to be gluten-free. However, the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>Can I use other types of candy instead of Cadbury eggs?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute Cadbury eggs with other candies like M&Ms, Reese's Pieces, or even chopped chocolate bars.</p>

    <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the dough or baked cookies for longer storage.</p>
