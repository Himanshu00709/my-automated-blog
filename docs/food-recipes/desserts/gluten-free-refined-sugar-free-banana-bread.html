    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free, refined sugar-free banana bread:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a loaf pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash the Bananas:</strong> In a large bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. The smoother the bananas, the more evenly the sweetness will distribute.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Wet Ingredients:</strong> Add the eggs, maple syrup, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract to the mashed bananas. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond flour, oat flour, baking soda, and cinnamon (if using).</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the bread dense.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the banana bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or a gluten-free all-purpose blend. Keep in mind that different flours may alter the texture and moisture content, so you may need to adjust the recipe slightly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and use a plant-based sweetener like agave syrup instead of maple syrup.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store the banana bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the banana bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months. Simply wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer-safe bag.</p>
    </div>
