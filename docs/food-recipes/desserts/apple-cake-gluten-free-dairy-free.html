    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get baking! Follow these simple steps to create a gluten-free, dairy-free apple cake that’s sure to impress.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with coconut oil and line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Whisk until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Apples</h3>
    <p>Peel and core the apples, then dice them into small pieces. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, melted coconut oil, vanilla extract, and almond milk until smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Fold in the diced apples.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and spread it evenly. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of dairy-free whipped cream.</p>
