    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan and set it aside. This will ensure that your pumpkin bars don't stick to the pan and come out easily once baked.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. This ensures that all the dry ingredients are evenly distributed, which is crucial for a consistent texture in your bars.</p>

    <h3>3. Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate large bowl, mix together the pumpkin puree, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and well combined. The pumpkin puree adds moisture and a rich, autumnal flavor to the bars.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense bars. The batter should be thick but pourable.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake the Bars</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The bars should be golden brown and springy to the touch.</p>

    <h3>6. Prepare the Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>
    <p>While the bars are cooling, prepare the cream cheese frosting. In a large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and butter together until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract, beating until the frosting is creamy and spreadable.</p>

    <h3>7. Frost and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the bars have completely cooled, spread the cream cheese frosting evenly over the top. Cut into squares and serve. These bars can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, but they're best enjoyed fresh!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the bars to be gluten-free. Simply substitute the gluten-free flour blend with an equal amount of all-purpose flour.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these bars ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! These bars can be made a day in advance. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator and bring them to room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze these pumpkin bars?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze these bars. Wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. They can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before serving.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of cream cheese frosting?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer a different topping, you can use a simple glaze made with powdered sugar and milk, or even a dollop of whipped cream. However, the cream cheese frosting pairs perfectly with the pumpkin flavor.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free pumpkin bars with cream cheese frosting are a delightful treat that captures the essence of fall. With their moist, spiced pumpkin base and creamy, tangy frosting, these bars are sure to become a seasonal favorite. Whether you're baking for a crowd or just treating yourself, this recipe is easy to follow and yields delicious results. So, grab your apron and get ready to enjoy the flavors of autumn in every bite!</p>
