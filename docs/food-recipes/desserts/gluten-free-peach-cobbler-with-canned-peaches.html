    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make this delicious gluten-free peach cobbler:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C). This ensures that your cobbler bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Peaches</h3>
    <p>Drain the canned peaches, reserving about 1/4 cup of the syrup or juice. Place the peaches in a medium-sized bowl and toss them with 1/2 cup of sugar and the ground cinnamon. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Cobbler Batter</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, remaining 1/2 cup of sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small pieces and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Cobbler</h3>
    <p>Pour the prepared peaches into a 9x9 inch baking dish. Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler batter evenly over the peaches. Don't worry if the batter doesn't cover the peaches completely; it will spread as it bakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cobbler</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. If the top starts to brown too quickly, you can cover it loosely with aluminum foil.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Remove the cobbler from the oven and let it cool for about 10 minutes before serving. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra treat.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Peach Cobbler</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free peach cobbler turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Gluten-Free Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that's specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right balance of starches and proteins to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Butter:</strong> Cold butter is key to achieving a flaky, tender crust. Make sure your butter is straight from the fridge when you incorporate it into the flour mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a tough, dense cobbler. Mix just until the ingredients are combined, and don't worry if there are a few lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the Sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a less sweet cobbler, you can reduce the amount of sugar in both the peaches and the batter. Taste the peaches before adding sugar to gauge their natural sweetness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh peaches instead of canned peaches?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh peaches if they're in season. Simply peel and slice the peaches, then toss them with sugar and cinnamon as directed in the recipe. You may need to adjust the baking time slightly, as fresh peaches can release more liquid than canned peaches.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and use a non-dairy milk such as almond milk or oat milk. Just make sure to choose unsweetened varieties to avoid altering the sweetness of the cobbler.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply place it in the oven at 350째F (175째C) for about 10-15 minutes, or until warmed through.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this cobbler?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cobbler for up to 2 months. Allow it to cool completely, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before placing it in the freezer. To reheat, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and then bake it in the oven until warmed through.</p>
