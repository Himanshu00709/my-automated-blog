    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's move on to the step-by-step instructions for making this delicious gluten-free banana pudding.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pudding Base</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, whisk together the egg yolks, cornstarch, and honey (or maple syrup) until smooth. Gradually add the coconut milk while continuing to whisk. Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and comes to a gentle boil. This should take about 5-7 minutes. Once thickened, remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Set aside to cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Layer the Bananas and Pudding</h3>
    <p>While the pudding is cooling, slice the bananas into thin rounds. In a serving dish or individual dessert cups, start by layering a few banana slices at the bottom. If you're using gluten-free vanilla wafers, you can also add a layer of wafers at this stage. Next, pour a portion of the pudding over the bananas and wafers. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of pudding on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Cover the pudding with plastic wrap, making sure the wrap touches the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until the pudding is fully set. Before serving, you can garnish with additional banana slices, gluten-free wafers, or a sprinkle of almond flour for added texture.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Banana Pudding</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free banana pudding is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. Bananas are a great source of potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure and supports heart health. Almond flour provides healthy fats, protein, and fiber, making it a nutritious alternative to regular flour. Coconut milk is rich in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are known for their energy-boosting properties and ability to support weight management.</p>
    <p>By using natural sweeteners like honey or maple syrup, you can avoid the refined sugars found in many traditional desserts. This makes the pudding a healthier option for those looking to satisfy their sweet tooth without compromising their health goals.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Banana Pudding</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this recipe vegan by substituting the egg yolks with a vegan thickening agent like agar-agar or cornstarch. Additionally, ensure that the gluten-free wafers you use are vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>How long does gluten-free banana pudding last in the fridge?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free banana pudding can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Make sure to keep it covered to prevent it from absorbing other odors in the fridge.</p>

        <h3>Can I use other fruits in this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While bananas are the star of this recipe, you can experiment with other fruits like strawberries, mangoes, or even a mix of berries. Just make sure to adjust the sweetness accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Is almond flour necessary, or can I use another gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour is preferred for its nutty flavor and nutritional benefits, but you can substitute it with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or oat flour. Keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>
