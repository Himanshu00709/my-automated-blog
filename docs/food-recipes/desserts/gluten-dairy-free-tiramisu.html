    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Coffee Mixture</h3>
    <p>Start by brewing a strong cup of coffee or espresso. Allow it to cool to room temperature. If desired, you can add a splash of gluten-free and dairy-free liqueur, such as amaretto or coffee liqueur, for an extra layer of flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Creamy Filling</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine your dairy-free mascarpone substitute (such as cashew cream or coconut cream) with a sweetener of your choice, like maple syrup or agave. If you’re using aquafaba, whip it until it forms stiff peaks and gently fold it into the cream mixture to create a light, airy texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Layers</h3>
    <p>Dip each gluten-free ladyfinger or sponge cake slice into the cooled coffee mixture, ensuring they are moist but not soggy. Arrange a layer of soaked ladyfingers at the bottom of your serving dish. Spread a layer of the creamy filling over the ladyfingers, then repeat the process to create multiple layers.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once assembled, cover the tiramisu and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld. Before serving, dust the top with gluten-free and dairy-free cocoa powder for the finishing touch.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free and Dairy-Free Tiramisu</h2>

    <p>This version of tiramisu not only caters to dietary restrictions but also offers several health benefits. By using gluten-free ingredients, you reduce the risk of inflammation and digestive issues for those with gluten sensitivities. Dairy-free alternatives, such as cashew or coconut cream, are rich in healthy fats and can be easier to digest for those with lactose intolerance. Additionally, using natural sweeteners like maple syrup can help reduce refined sugar intake, making this dessert a healthier option overall.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this tiramisu ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes! In fact, tiramisu tastes even better when made a day in advance. This allows the flavors to fully develop and the layers to set properly.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of cashew cream?</h3>
        <p>If you’re allergic to nuts, you can use coconut cream or a store-bought dairy-free cream cheese alternative. Just ensure it has a similar consistency to mascarpone.</p>

        <h3>Is this dessert suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! By using plant-based ingredients like aquafaba and dairy-free cream, this tiramisu is completely vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free and dairy-free tiramisu?</h3>
