    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get baking! Follow these simple steps to create a delicious gluten-free courgette cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In another bowl, beat the eggs until light and frothy. Add the sugar, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined. Stir in the grated courgette.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Mixtures</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. If you’re using walnuts, fold them into the batter at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and serve. Enjoy your gluten-free courgette cake as is or with a dollop of whipped cream or a dusting of powdered sugar.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Courgette Cake</h2>

    <p>This cake isn’t just delicious—it’s also packed with nutrients. Courgettes are low in calories but high in essential vitamins and minerals. They’re particularly rich in vitamin A, which is important for eye health, and vitamin C, which supports the immune system. Additionally, the use of gluten-free flour makes this cake suitable for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. The inclusion of walnuts adds a dose of healthy fats and protein, making this cake a well-rounded treat.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Courgette Cake</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and moisture content may vary, so you may need to adjust the recipe slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and use a plant-based oil like coconut oil. Ensure that your sugar is also vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months. Just wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer-safe bag.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other ingredients to the cake?</h3>
        <p>Certainly! Feel free to add other mix-ins like raisins, chocolate chips, or shredded coconut. Just be mindful of the moisture content, as additional ingredients may affect the texture of the cake.</p>
