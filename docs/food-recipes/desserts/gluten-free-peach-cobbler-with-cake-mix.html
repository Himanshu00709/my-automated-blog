    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>

                <th>Quantity</th>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free peach cobbler:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your cobbler bakes evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Peaches:</strong> If you're using fresh peaches, peel and slice them. If you're using canned peaches, drain them well. Place the peaches in a large mixing bowl and toss them with sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla extract. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Melt the Butter:</strong> In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter. Once melted, pour it into a 9x13 inch baking dish, ensuring the bottom is evenly coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer the Ingredients:</strong> Spread the prepared peaches evenly over the melted butter in the baking dish. Next, sprinkle the gluten-free cake mix evenly over the peaches. Do not stir the mixture; the cake mix will form a crust as it bakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Water:</strong> Slowly pour the water over the top of the cake mix. Again, do not stir. The water will help the cake mix to form a delicious, crumbly topping.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the peaches are bubbling.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cobbler to cool for about 10 minutes before serving. This will help the flavors to meld together and make it easier to serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Peach Cobbler</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free peach cobbler turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Cake Mix:</strong> Not all gluten-free cake mixes are created equal. Look for one that has good reviews and is known for its texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Peaches When Possible:</strong> While canned peaches are convenient, fresh peaches will give your cobbler a more vibrant flavor. If using canned peaches, opt for those packed in juice rather than syrup to avoid excessive sweetness.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> The key to a perfect cobbler is to layer the ingredients without stirring. This allows the cake mix to form a crust on top while the peaches remain juicy underneath.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> Depending on your preference, you can adjust the amount of sugar used. If your peaches are very sweet, you may want to reduce the sugar slightly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen peaches instead of fresh or canned?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen peaches. Just make sure to thaw them completely and drain any excess liquid before using them in the recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat it in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other fruits to this cobbler?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other fruits like berries, apples, or even a mix of fruits. Just keep in mind that the baking time may vary depending on the fruit you choose.</p>
    </div>
