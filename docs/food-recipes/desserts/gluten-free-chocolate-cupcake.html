    <p>Follow these steps to bake your gluten-free chocolate cupcakes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, mix the sugar, eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the Cupcake Liners:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cupcake liners, filling each about two-thirds full.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Chocolate Cupcakes</h2>
    <p>Here are some expert tips to ensure your gluten-free chocolate cupcakes turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking and contains xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cupcakes. Mix until just combined to keep them light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free baked goods can sometimes take longer to bake. Use a toothpick to check if the cupcakes are done; it should come out clean or with a few crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Let Them Cool Completely:</strong> Gluten-free cupcakes can be more delicate when warm. Let them cool completely before frosting or serving.</li>
    </ul>
