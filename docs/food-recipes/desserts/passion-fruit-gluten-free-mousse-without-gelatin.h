    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Passion Fruit Pulp</h3>
    <p>Start by extracting the pulp from fresh passion fruits. Cut the fruits in half and scoop out the seeds and pulp. If you prefer a smoother texture, you can strain the pulp to remove the seeds. Alternatively, you can use store-bought passion fruit pulp, but make sure it’s 100% natural and free from additives.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Whip the Cream</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream until it forms soft peaks. Be careful not to over-whip, as this can cause the cream to become grainy. The whipped cream will give the mousse its light and airy texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the passion fruit pulp, condensed milk, and vanilla extract. If you’re using chia seeds for thickening, add them at this stage and let the mixture sit for 10 minutes to allow the seeds to absorb some of the liquid. Gently fold the passion fruit mixture into the whipped cream until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Transfer the mousse into individual serving glasses or a large serving bowl. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until the mousse is set. Before serving, you can garnish with additional passion fruit pulp or a sprinkle of chia seeds for added texture and flavor.</p>
