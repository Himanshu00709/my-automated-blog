<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the recipe. Follow these steps to create a delicious gluten-free carrot cake with pineapple.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In another bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the vegetable oil and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Add Carrots and Pineapple</h3>
<p>Fold in the grated carrots, crushed pineapple, and chopped walnuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can frost the cake with your favorite cream cheese frosting or enjoy it as is.</p>
