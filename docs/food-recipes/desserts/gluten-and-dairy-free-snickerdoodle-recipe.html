<h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Snickerdoodle Recipe</h1>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent sticking.</p>

<h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt. Set aside.</p>

<h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the dairy-free butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

<h3>4. Add Egg and Vanilla</h3>
<p>Add the egg (or flax egg) and vanilla extract to the butter-sugar mixture. Mix until well combined.</p>

<h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a tougher cookie.</p>

<h3>6. Form the Dough Balls</h3>
<p>Using a cookie scoop or your hands, form the dough into 1-inch balls. Roll each ball in the cinnamon sugar coating until fully covered.</p>

<h3>7. Bake</h3>
<p>Place the dough balls on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may look slightly underbaked, but they will firm up as they cool.</p>

<h3>8. Cool and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten and dairy-free snickerdoodles with a glass of your favorite dairy-free milk!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture may vary. Almond flour adds a nice chewiness, but you can substitute it with another nut flour or even coconut flour if needed.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the egg with a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) and ensure your dairy-free butter is vegan-friendly.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
    <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the dough balls and bake them as needed.</p>

    <h3>Can I add other spices?</h3>
    <p>Yes, feel free to get creative with your spices. Nutmeg or cardamom can add an interesting twist to the classic cinnamon flavor.</p>
