    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all the ingredients ready, let’s walk through the process of making this gluten-free sugar-free peach cobbler. Follow these steps for a perfect dessert every time.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). While the oven is heating, grease a baking dish with a little butter or coconut oil to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Peach Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, combine the sliced peaches with half of the sweetener and the cinnamon. Mix well to ensure the peaches are evenly coated. Transfer the peach mixture to the prepared baking dish, spreading it out evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
    <p>In another bowl, mix the almond flour, coconut flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the melted butter, almond milk, vanilla extract, and the remaining sweetener. Stir until the mixture forms a thick batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Drop spoonfuls of the batter over the peach filling, spreading it out as evenly as possible. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the peaches are bubbling.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cobbler to cool for about 10 minutes before serving. This dessert is best enjoyed warm, and you can top it with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of sugar-free ice cream for an extra treat.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use other fruits instead of peaches?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This recipe is versatile and works well with other fruits like berries, apples, or pears. Just adjust the sweetener according to the natural sweetness of the fruit you choose.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this recipe vegan by substituting the butter with coconut oil and using a plant-based milk like almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat it in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this cobbler?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked cobbler for up to 2 months. Make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn. Thaw in the refrigerator before reheating.</p>
