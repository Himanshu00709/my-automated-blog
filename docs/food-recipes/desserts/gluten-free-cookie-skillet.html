    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free cookie skillet:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your skillet will bake evenly and achieve that perfect golden-brown crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Skillet</h3>
    <p>Lightly grease a 6-8 inch cast iron skillet with butter or a non-stick cooking spray. This will prevent the cookie from sticking and make it easier to serve.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cookie.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Chocolate Chips</h3>
    <p>Fold in the chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the dough. You can also add nuts or other mix-ins at this stage if desired.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Cookie Skillet</h3>
    <p>Transfer the dough to the prepared skillet, spreading it out evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the center is set but still slightly soft.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Remove the skillet from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a drizzle of caramel sauce for an extra indulgent treat.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Cookie Skillet</h2>

    <p>Here are some expert tips to ensure your gluten-free cookie skillet turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that contains xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a tough cookie. Mix until just combined to keep the texture light and tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Mix-Ins:</strong> While chocolate chips are a classic choice, feel free to get creative with your mix-ins. Try adding nuts, dried fruit, or even a swirl of peanut butter.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch the Baking Time:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so keep an eye on your skillet as it bakes. You want the edges to be golden brown but the center to remain slightly soft.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cookie Skillets</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make a gluten-free cookie skillet dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make a dairy-free version by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and using dairy-free chocolate chips.</p>

        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour can be used, but it will change the texture of the cookie. Almond flour tends to make baked goods denser and moister, so you may need to adjust the recipe slightly.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>If you have any leftovers (unlikely!), you can store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, wrap the skillet tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to a week.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the dough?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the dough for up to 3 months. Simply shape the dough into a disk, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap, and place it in a freezer-safe bag. When ready to bake, let the dough thaw in the refrigerator overnight before proceeding with the recipe.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>The gluten-free cookie skillet is a testament to the fact that gluten-free baking can be just as delicious and satisfying as traditional baking. With the right ingredients and a little bit of care, you can create a dessert that's not only safe for those with gluten sensitivities but also a crowd-pleaser for everyone. Whether you're enjoying it straight out of the oven or sharing it with friends and family, this warm, gooey treat is sure to become a favorite in your dessert repertoire.
