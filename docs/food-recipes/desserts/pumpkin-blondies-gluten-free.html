    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free pumpkin blondies is a straightforward process, but there are a few tips and tricks to ensure they turn out perfectly. Follow these steps for the best results:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you're ready to bake, which is crucial for even cooking.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare Your Baking Pan</h3>
    <p>Line an 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper or lightly grease it with butter or oil. This prevents the blondies from sticking and makes it easier to remove them after baking.</p>

    <h3>3. Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the melted butter or coconut oil, brown sugar, and pumpkin puree. Mix until smooth. Then, add the eggs and vanilla extract, stirring until everything is well combined.</p>

    <h3>4. Add the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense blondies.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake the Blondies</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs. Allow the blondies to cool completely before cutting them into squares.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pumpkin Blondies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin puree?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh pumpkin puree if you prefer. Simply roast a small sugar pumpkin, remove the skin, and blend the flesh until smooth. Make sure the puree is thick and not watery, as excess moisture can affect the texture of the blondies.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these blondies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make vegan gluten-free pumpkin blondies, replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and use coconut oil instead of butter.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free pumpkin blondies?</h3>
        <p>Store the blondies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months. Just make sure to wrap them tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil before freezing.</p>

        <h3>Can I add mix-ins like chocolate chips or nuts?</h3>
        <p>Definitely! Chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or even dried cranberries can add extra texture and flavor to your blondies. Simply fold them into the batter before baking.</p>

With their moist, chewy texture and warm, spiced flavor, these blondies are sure to become a seasonal favorite.
