    <h1>Gluten-Free Cranberry Cake: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance but also among health-conscious individuals looking to reduce their gluten intake. One delightful recipe that has gained attention is the gluten-free cranberry cake. This cake is not only moist and flavorful but also packed with the tartness of cranberries, making it a perfect dessert for any occasion. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free baking, the nutritional value of cranberries, and provide a step-by-step guide to making this delicious cake.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Baking?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking is more than just a trend; it’s a necessity for many people. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and other health problems for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Even for those without these conditions, reducing gluten intake can lead to improved digestion, reduced inflammation, and better overall health. Gluten-free baking allows you to enjoy your favorite treats without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>The Nutritional Benefits of Cranberries</h2>
    <p>Cranberries are a powerhouse of nutrients. They are rich in vitamins C and E, fiber, and antioxidants, which help boost the immune system, improve digestion, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. The tartness of cranberries adds a unique flavor profile to baked goods, balancing the sweetness and creating a delightful contrast. Incorporating cranberries into your gluten-free cake not only enhances the taste but also adds a nutritional boost.</p>
