    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>These dairy-free, gluten-free pumpkin bars are not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Pumpkin is rich in vitamins A and C, which are essential for immune health and skin health. Almond flour provides a good source of healthy fats and protein, while coconut oil offers medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) that are easily digested and provide quick energy. The use of flaxseed meal as an egg substitute adds omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial for heart health.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like oat flour or buckwheat flour. However, the texture may vary slightly, so it's best to stick with a 1:1 gluten-free baking blend for the best results.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute the coconut sugar?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can use other natural sweeteners like maple syrup, honey, or even stevia. Keep in mind that liquid sweeteners may alter the texture, so you may need to adjust the amount of flour slightly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these pumpkin bars?</h3>
        <p>Store the bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or chocolate chips?</h3>
        <p>Yes, feel free to add your favorite mix-ins like chopped nuts, dairy-free chocolate chips, or even dried fruit for an extra layer of flavor and texture.</p>
    </div>
