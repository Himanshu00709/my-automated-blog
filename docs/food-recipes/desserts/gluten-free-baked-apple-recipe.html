    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you’re ready to bake the apples.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Apples</h3>
    <p>Wash the apples thoroughly and pat them dry. Using a sharp knife or an apple corer, carefully remove the cores from the apples, making sure not to cut through the bottom. This creates a cavity for the filling. If you don’t have an apple corer, you can use a paring knife to carefully carve out the core.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, combine the gluten-free rolled oats, almond flour, brown sugar, ground cinnamon, chopped nuts, and raisins (if using). Mix well to ensure all the ingredients are evenly distributed. Add the melted butter or coconut oil and vanilla extract, and stir until the mixture is crumbly but holds together when pressed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Stuff the Apples</h3>
    <p>Take the prepared apples and stuff them generously with the oat mixture. Pack the filling tightly into the cavities, and if there’s any leftover filling, you can sprinkle it on top of the apples.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Apples</h3>
    <p>Place the stuffed apples in a baking dish and pour the water or apple juice into the bottom of the dish. This helps keep the apples moist during baking. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the apples are tender and the topping is golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the apples are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Serve warm, optionally with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra treat.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Baked Apples</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use other types of apples?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While Honeycrisp and Granny Smith apples are popular choices due to their balance of sweetness and tartness, you can use any variety of apple you prefer. Just keep in mind that softer apples may bake faster, so adjust the baking time accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make this recipe vegan by substituting the butter with coconut oil and ensuring that the sugar you use is vegan-friendly (such as coconut sugar).</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover baked apples?</h3>
        <p>If you have any leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply place them in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes, or until warmed through.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze baked apples?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze baked apples. Allow them to cool completely, then wrap each apple individually in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe container. They can be stored in the freezer for up to 2 months. To reheat, thaw in the refrigerator overnight and then warm in the oven.</p>
