    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Cookie Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Set this dry mixture aside.</p>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined. Next, fold in the pumpkin puree, ensuring the mixture is smooth and evenly incorporated.</p>

    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense cookies. The dough should be soft and slightly sticky.</p>

    <h3>2. Baking the Cookies</h3>

    <p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Gently flatten each cookie with the back of a spoon or your fingers, as they won't spread much during baking.</p>

    <p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden and the centers are set. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>3. Making the Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>

    <p>While the cookies are cooling, prepare the cream cheese frosting. In a medium bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar, mixing until well combined. If the frosting is too thick, add 1-2 tablespoons of milk to achieve your desired consistency.</p>

    <p>Once the cookies are completely cool, spread a generous layer of cream cheese frosting on top of each cookie. For an extra touch, you can sprinkle a little cinnamon or pumpkin spice on top of the frosting.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture of the cookies may vary. A blend of gluten-free all-purpose flour and almond flour works best for this recipe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter. For the cream cheese frosting, use a dairy-free cream cheese substitute.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. If you prefer to keep them longer, you can refrigerate them for up to a week. Just be sure to bring them to room temperature before serving.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I freeze these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze both the baked cookies and the cookie dough. To freeze the baked cookies, place them in a single layer in an airtight container, separating layers with parchment paper. For the dough, scoop it into portions and freeze on a baking sheet before transferring to a freezer bag. Thaw before baking or frosting.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <p>These gluten-free pumpkin cookies with cream cheese frosting are a delightful treat that captures the essence of fall in every bite.
