    <h1>Gluten-Free Haystack Cookies: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>Haystack cookies are a classic treat that many of us have enjoyed since childhood. These no-bake cookies are not only easy to make but also incredibly versatile, allowing for a variety of flavors and textures. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, haystack cookies can be a delightful indulgence without the worry of gluten-related health issues. In this blog post, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free haystack cookies, from their history to how you can make them at home.</p>

    <h2>What Are Haystack Cookies?</h2>

    <p>Haystack cookies are a type of no-bake cookie that typically consists of a mixture of melted chocolate, butterscotch, or peanut butter, combined with chow mein noodles or shredded coconut. The mixture is then dropped by spoonfuls onto a baking sheet, forming little mounds that resemble haystacks. Once cooled, these cookies harden into a crunchy, sweet treat that’s perfect for any occasion.</p>

    <p>Traditionally, haystack cookies are made with chow mein noodles, which contain gluten. However, with the rise in gluten-free diets, many people have adapted the recipe to use gluten-free alternatives, such as gluten-free pretzels or shredded coconut. This makes haystack cookies accessible to those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of health issues, including digestive problems, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. As a result, many people choose to follow a gluten-free diet to avoid these complications.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free haystack cookies are a great option for those who want to enjoy a sweet treat without the risk of gluten exposure. By using gluten-free ingredients, you can create a cookie that’s just as delicious as the traditional version but safe for everyone to enjoy.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>

        <li><strong>Melt the Chocolate and Butterscotch:</strong> In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate chips and butterscotch chips. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the mixture is fully melted and smooth. If you’re using peanut butter, add it to the mixture and stir until well combined.</li>

        <li><strong>Cool and Harden:</strong> Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or until the cookies have hardened. Once set, they’re ready to serve!</li>
