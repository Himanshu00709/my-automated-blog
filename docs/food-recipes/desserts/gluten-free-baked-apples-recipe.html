    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your apples bake evenly and develop a tender texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Apples</h3>
    <p>Wash the apples thoroughly and remove the cores using an apple corer or a small knife. Be careful not to cut through the bottom of the apples, as this will help hold the filling in place. If desired, you can also peel the apples, but leaving the skin on adds extra fiber and nutrients.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, combine the gluten-free oats, almond flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, chopped nuts, and raisins. Mix well to ensure all ingredients are evenly distributed. Add the melted butter or coconut oil and vanilla extract, and stir until the mixture becomes crumbly.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Fill the Apples</h3>
    <p>Stuff each apple with the prepared filling, pressing it down gently to pack it in. Place the filled apples in a baking dish and pour the water or apple juice into the bottom of the dish. This will help keep the apples moist during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Apples</h3>
    <p>Bake the apples in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes, or until they are tender and the filling is golden brown. You can test the doneness by inserting a fork into the apples; it should slide in easily.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Remove the baked apples from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Serve them warm, optionally topped with a dollop of whipped cream, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, or a drizzle of caramel sauce for extra indulgence.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Baked Apples</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free baked apples recipe is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Apples are rich in dietary fiber, which aids digestion and promotes gut health. They also contain antioxidants like quercetin, which can help reduce inflammation and support heart health. The addition of nuts and oats provides healthy fats, protein, and additional fiber, making this dessert a wholesome choice.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Baked Apples</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use other fruits instead of apples?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can adapt this recipe to use pears or even peaches. However, baking times may vary depending on the fruit you choose.</p>

        <h3>2. Are gluten-free oats necessary?</h3>
        <p>If you have celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, it’s important to use certified gluten-free oats to avoid cross-contamination. Regular oats may contain traces of gluten.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with coconut oil or another plant-based fat, and ensure your toppings are vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>4. How should I store leftover baked apples?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat them in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
