    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make these gluten-free lemon blueberry bars:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang on the sides for easy removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the crust:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, and sugar. Cut in the cold butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press this mixture firmly into the bottom of the prepared baking pan to form the crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the crust:</strong> Bake the crust in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until it is lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly while you prepare the filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, lemon juice, lemon zest, and sugar until well combined. Gently fold in the fresh blueberries.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the bars:</strong> Pour the lemon-blueberry filling over the baked crust, spreading it evenly. Return the pan to the oven and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes, or until the filling is set and the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the bars to cool completely in the pan before lifting them out using the parchment paper overhang. Cut into squares and serve. For an extra touch, you can dust the bars with powdered sugar before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free lemon blueberry bars turn out perfectly every time, here are some tips to keep in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the crust:</strong> When preparing the crust, be careful not to overmix the dough. Overmixing can lead to a tough crust, so stop mixing as soon as the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Use fresh ingredients:</strong> Fresh lemon juice and blueberries will give your bars the best flavor. Avoid using bottled lemon juice, as it can have a bitter taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the bars cool completely:</strong> It's important to let the bars cool completely before cutting them. This will help them set properly and make them easier to slice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries if fresh ones are not available. However, be sure to thaw and drain them well before using to prevent excess moisture in the filling.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these bars dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or a vegan butter substitute, to make these bars dairy-free.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store these bars?</h3>
        <p>These bars can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different fruits, such as raspberries or blackberries, to create your own unique variation of these bars.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free lemon blueberry bars are a delightful treat that combines the tangy zest of lemon with the sweet burst of blueberries. They are perfect for summer gatherings, afternoon tea, or simply as a sweet indulgence. With the right ingredients and a little patience, you can create a dessert that is not only gluten-free but also incredibly delicious.
