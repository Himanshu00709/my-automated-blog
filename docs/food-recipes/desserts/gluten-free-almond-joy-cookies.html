    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free Almond Joy cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the almond flour, shredded coconut, baking soda, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, melted coconut oil, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a thick dough forms. Fold in the dark chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the cookies:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or your hands, form the dough into small balls and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Flatten each ball slightly with your hand or the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Be careful not to overbake, as the cookies will continue to firm up as they cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free Almond Joy cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</li>
    </ol>
