    <h1>Gluten-Free Derby Pie: A Delicious Twist on a Classic Dessert</h1>

    <p>Derby Pie, a beloved Southern dessert, is known for its rich, gooey filling of chocolate and walnuts encased in a flaky crust. Traditionally, this pie is made with a wheat-based crust, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this treat can be a challenge. Enter the gluten-free Derby Pie—a delightful adaptation that allows everyone to savor this classic dessert without compromising on taste or texture. In this article, we’ll explore the origins of Derby Pie, the benefits of going gluten-free, and provide a step-by-step guide to creating your own gluten-free version at home.</p>

    <h2>The Origins of Derby Pie</h2>

    <p>Derby Pie was first created in the 1950s at the Melrose Inn in Prospect, Kentucky. The pie quickly gained popularity for its unique combination of chocolate, walnuts, and a hint of bourbon, all nestled in a buttery crust. Over the years, it has become a staple at Kentucky Derby parties and Southern gatherings. The name "Derby Pie" is actually a registered trademark, which is why you’ll often see similar recipes referred to as "Kentucky Bourbon Pie" or "Chocolate Walnut Pie."</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained significant attention in recent years, not only for those with celiac disease but also for individuals with gluten sensitivity or those seeking a healthier lifestyle. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and inflammation in some people. By opting for gluten-free alternatives, you can enjoy your favorite foods without the adverse effects. Moreover, gluten-free baking has come a long way, with a variety of flours and ingredients available that mimic the texture and flavor of traditional baked goods.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Crust</h3>

    <p>Start by making the crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and a pinch of salt. Add the cold, cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Roll Out the Dough</h3>

    <p>Once the dough has chilled, roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking) to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Carefully transfer the dough to the dish, pressing it gently into the edges. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges for a decorative finish. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Filling</h3>

    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, corn syrup, and bourbon until well combined. Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped walnuts. Pour the filling into the prepared crust, spreading it evenly.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Pie</h3>

    <p>Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown. If the edges of the crust begin to brown too quickly, cover them with aluminum foil to prevent burning.</p>

    <h3>5. Cool and Serve</h3>

    <p>Allow the pie to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra indulgent treat.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Derby Pie</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a store-bought gluten-free crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a store-bought gluten-free crust to save time. Just make sure it’s a high-quality brand that you enjoy, as the crust is a key component of the pie.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of bourbon?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use bourbon, you can substitute it with an equal amount of vanilla extract or simply omit it altogether. The pie will still be delicious!</p>

        <h3>Can I make this pie nut-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you have a nut allergy, you can omit the walnuts or replace them with seeds like sunflower or pumpkin seeds for a similar crunch.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftover pie?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover pie in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the pie for up to 3 months.</p>
