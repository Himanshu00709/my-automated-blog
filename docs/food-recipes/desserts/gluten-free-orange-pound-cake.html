    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free orange pound cake:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan and line it with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Eggs and Flavorings</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the fresh orange juice, orange zest, and vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. Finally, fold in the Greek yogurt until the batter is smooth and well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>6. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>7. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream, if desired.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>This gluten-free orange pound cake is not only delicious but also offers several nutritional benefits. Almond flour, one of the key ingredients, is rich in healthy fats, protein, and fiber. It’s also a great source of vitamin E and magnesium. The fresh orange juice and zest provide a boost of vitamin C, which is essential for immune health and skin vitality. Additionally, Greek yogurt adds a dose of probiotics, which are beneficial for gut health.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary slightly. Almond flour is recommended for its moisture and richness, but you can also try coconut flour or oat flour.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and replace the Greek yogurt with a dairy-free yogurt or applesauce.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other citrus flavors?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other citrus flavors like lemon or lime. Simply replace the orange juice and zest with your preferred citrus fruit.</p>
