<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a cupcake tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with dairy-free butter or oil.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the batter.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, mix the almond milk, granulated sugar, vegetable oil, apple cider vinegar, and vanilla extract. Stir until the sugar is fully dissolved and the mixture is smooth.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense cupcakes.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Fill the Cupcake Liners</h3>
<p>Using a spoon or an ice cream scoop, fill each cupcake liner about two-thirds full with the batter. This allows room for the cupcakes to rise without overflowing.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake the Cupcakes</h3>
<p>Place the cupcake tin in the preheated oven and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Be sure to check the cupcakes at the 18-minute mark to avoid overbaking.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Cool and Decorate</h3>
<p>Once baked, remove the cupcakes from the oven and let them cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can decorate them with your favorite dairy-free frosting or enjoy them as is.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flour blends, such as rice flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary slightly depending on the flour you choose.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of almond milk?</h3>
    <p>You can substitute almond milk with any other dairy-free milk, such as soy milk, oat milk, or coconut milk. Each type of milk will impart a slightly different flavor to the cupcakes.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these cupcakes vegan?</h3>
    <p>This recipe is already vegan-friendly as it does not contain any animal products. Just ensure that the sugar you use is vegan, as some sugars are processed with bone char.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these cupcakes?</h3>
    <p>Store the cupcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate them for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>
