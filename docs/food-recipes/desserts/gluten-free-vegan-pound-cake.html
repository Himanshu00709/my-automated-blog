    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create a delicious gluten-free vegan pound cake:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cake bakes evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Pan:</strong> Grease a loaf pan with vegan butter or oil, and line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together your gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix your plant-based milk, vegan butter or oil, egg replacer, and sweetener until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve as desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfecting Your Gluten-Free Vegan Pound Cake</h2>

    <p>While the recipe above is straightforward, there are a few tips and tricks that can help you achieve the perfect gluten-free vegan pound cake:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. For the best results, use a blend of gluten-free flours that includes a mix of starches (like tapioca or potato starch) and whole grain flours (like brown rice or almond flour).</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a tough cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined, and then stop.</li>
        <li><strong>Let It Cool:</strong> Allowing the cake to cool completely before slicing ensures that it holds together well and has the perfect texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add your favorite flavors to the cake, such as vanilla extract, lemon zest, or even chocolate chips.</li>
    </ul>
