    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free key lime bars:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang for easy removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, softened butter, and granulated sugar. Mix until the dough comes together. Press the dough evenly into the bottom of the prepared baking pan. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Filling:</strong> While the crust is baking, whisk together the key lime juice, eggs, condensed milk, and key lime zest in a separate bowl until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble and Bake:</strong> Once the crust is done, pour the filling over the warm crust and return the pan to the oven. Bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the filling is set.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Chill:</strong> Allow the bars to cool completely in the pan before transferring them to the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once chilled, lift the bars out of the pan using the parchment paper overhang. Cut into squares and dust with powdered sugar if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Key Lime Bars</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free key lime bars turn out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Key Limes:</strong> Freshly squeezed key lime juice provides the best flavor. If key limes are unavailable, regular limes can be used as a substitute, though the flavor will be slightly different.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overbake:</strong> The filling should be set but still slightly jiggly in the center when you take it out of the oven. It will continue to set as it cools.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill Thoroughly:</strong> Chilling the bars is crucial for achieving the right texture. It allows the filling to firm up and makes cutting into clean squares easier.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>How long do gluten-free key lime bars last?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free key lime bars can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 2 months.</p>
