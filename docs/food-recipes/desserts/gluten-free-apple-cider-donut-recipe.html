    <h1>Gluten-Free Apple Cider Donut Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Apple Cider Donuts?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking has come a long way in recent years, and with the availability of high-quality gluten-free flours, it’s easier than ever to create baked goods that are both delicious and safe for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Apple cider donuts are a perfect example of a treat that can be easily adapted to a gluten-free diet without sacrificing flavor or texture. The key is to use a blend of gluten-free flours that mimic the structure and texture of traditional wheat flour.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Reduce the Apple Cider</h3>

    <p>Start by reducing the apple cider. Pour 1 cup of apple cider into a small saucepan and bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Allow it to simmer until it has reduced to about 1/2 cup. This will concentrate the flavor of the cider, giving your donuts a more intense apple taste. Set the reduced cider aside to cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Dry Ingredients</h3>

    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ground cinnamon, and ground nutmeg. Make sure all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer on medium speed. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the reduced apple cider and buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients, mixing just until combined after each addition. Be careful not to overmix the batter, as this can result in dense donuts.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Donuts</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a donut pan with non-stick cooking spray. Spoon the batter into the prepared donut pan, filling each cavity about 2/3 full. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the donuts comes out clean. Allow the donuts to cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Coat the Donuts</h3>

    <p>While the donuts are cooling, prepare the coating. In a small bowl, mix together the granulated sugar and ground cinnamon. Once the donuts are cool enough to handle, dip each one into the cinnamon-sugar mixture, coating both sides evenly.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. A blend of gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, almond flour, and tapioca flour, often works best for achieving a light and fluffy texture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these donuts dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a non-dairy milk in place of buttermilk. Just be sure to choose a milk that complements the flavor of the apple cider.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store the donuts?</h3>
        <p>Store the donuts in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the donuts for up to 2 months. Thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>
    </div>
