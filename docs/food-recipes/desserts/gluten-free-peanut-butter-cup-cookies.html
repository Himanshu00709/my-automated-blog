    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get baking! Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free peanut butter cup cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugars:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the wet ingredients:</strong> Beat in the peanut butter, egg, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the peanut butter cups:</strong> Gently fold in the chopped mini peanut butter cups until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free peanut butter cup cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit different from traditional baking, but with these tips, you’ll achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a reliable gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right combination of flours and starches to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix the dough just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough if needed:</strong> If your dough is too sticky, chilling it for 30 minutes can make it easier to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can sometimes look underbaked when they’re actually done. Look for lightly golden edges and a set center.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>Can I use natural peanut butter for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use natural peanut butter, but keep in mind that it may affect the texture of the cookies. Natural peanut butter tends to be oilier, so you may need to adjust the amount of flour slightly to achieve the right consistency.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make these cookies dairy-free, simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or a plant-based butter. Also, ensure that the peanut butter cups you use are dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store your gluten-free peanut butter cup cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months. Just be sure to let them cool completely before storing.</p>

        <h3>Can I use regular flour if I don’t need gluten-free cookies?</h3>
        <p>Yes, if you don’t need gluten-free cookies, you can substitute the gluten-free flour with an equal amount of all-purpose flour. The rest of the recipe remains the same.</p>
