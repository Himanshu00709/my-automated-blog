    <h1>Gluten-Free Rhubarb Pie: A Delicious and Healthy Dessert</h1>
    <p>Rhubarb pie is a classic dessert that has been enjoyed for generations. Its tangy flavor and sweet filling make it a favorite among pie enthusiasts. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying a traditional rhubarb pie can be challenging.

Additionally, gluten-free baking often incorporates a variety of alternative flours, such as almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour, which can add unique flavors and textures to your baked goods.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Pie Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by making the gluten-free pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the ice water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Divide the dough into two equal portions, shape them into discs, wrap them in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Rhubarb Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the rhubarb filling. In a large bowl, combine the chopped rhubarb, granulated sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Mix well to ensure that the rhubarb is evenly coated. Set the filling aside to allow the flavors to meld while you roll out the pie crust.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disc of the chilled dough into a circle large enough to fit your pie dish. Carefully transfer the dough to the pie dish and press it gently into the bottom and sides. Trim any excess dough hanging over the edges. Pour the rhubarb filling into the prepared crust. Roll out the second disc of dough and place it over the filling. You can create a lattice top or simply cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape. Seal the edges of the pie crust by crimping them with a fork or your fingers.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Pie</h3>
    <p>Place the pie on the middle rack of the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. If the edges of the crust begin to brown too quickly, you can cover them with aluminum foil to prevent burning. Once the pie is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool completely before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Rhubarb Pie</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen rhubarb for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen rhubarb if fresh rhubarb is not available. However, make sure to thaw and drain the rhubarb thoroughly before using it in the filling to prevent excess moisture.</p>

        <h3>What is the best gluten-free flour blend for pie crust?</h3>
        <p>There are several gluten-free flour blends available on the market, and the best one for pie crust is often a matter of personal preference. Look for a blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch for the best texture and flavor.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this pie ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make the pie ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze the unbaked pie for up to 2 months. If freezing, bake the pie directly from the freezer, adding an additional 10-15 minutes to the baking time.</p>

        <h3>Is rhubarb pie healthy?</h3>
        <p>Rhubarb is low in calories and high in fiber, making it a relatively healthy dessert option. However, the sugar content in the filling should be consumed in moderation. You can reduce the amount of sugar or use a natural sweetener like honey or maple syrup for a healthier alternative.</p>
