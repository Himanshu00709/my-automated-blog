<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making a Gluten-Free Chocolate Crust</h2>

<p>Making a gluten-free chocolate crust is simpler than you might think. Follow these steps to create a delicious and foolproof crust:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 ½ cups of almond flour, ¼ cup of cocoa powder, and a pinch of salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure an even distribution.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, mix ¼ cup of melted butter or coconut oil with 2-3 tablespoons of your chosen natural sweetener. Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and stir until well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Mix and Press</h3>
<p>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms. Press the dough evenly into a pie dish or tart pan, making sure to cover the bottom and sides. Use the back of a spoon or your fingers to smooth the surface.</p>
