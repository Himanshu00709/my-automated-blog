<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Choux Pastry</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). In a medium saucepan, combine the water, butter, and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Once the butter has melted and the mixture is boiling, reduce the heat to low and add the gluten-free flour blend all at once. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mixture forms a ball and pulls away from the sides of the pan. Remove the pan from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Next, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. The dough should be smooth and glossy. Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Pipe 4-inch-long strips of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving space between each eclair. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the eclairs are golden brown and puffed. Remove from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack.</p>

<h3>2. Making the Cream Filling</h3>

<p>While the eclairs are cooling, prepare the cream filling. In a large mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract, and continue to whip until stiff peaks form. Transfer the whipped cream to a piping bag fitted with a small round tip.</p>

<h3>3. Assembling the Eclairs</h3>

<p>Once the eclairs have cooled, use a sharp knife to make a small slit in the side of each eclair. Carefully pipe the whipped cream filling into the eclairs through the slit. Be sure to fill them evenly, but avoid overfilling, as this can cause the eclairs to burst.</p>

<h3>4. Preparing the Chocolate Glaze</h3>

<p>To make the chocolate glaze, melt the dark chocolate and milk together in a microwave-safe bowl or over a double boiler. Stir until smooth and glossy. Dip the top of each eclair into the chocolate glaze, allowing the excess to drip off. Place the eclairs on a wire rack to set.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. However, make sure that the blend is suitable for baking and has a similar consistency to all-purpose flour. Some popular options include almond flour, rice flour, and tapioca flour.</p>

    <h3>How should I store the eclairs?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free eclairs are best enjoyed fresh, but they can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Be sure to let them come to room temperature before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze the eclairs?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the unfilled eclairs for up to 1 month. Once thawed, fill them with the whipped cream and add the chocolate glaze just before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a different filling?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! While whipped cream is a classic filling, you can also use pastry cream, custard, or even a dairy-free alternative like coconut cream.</p>
