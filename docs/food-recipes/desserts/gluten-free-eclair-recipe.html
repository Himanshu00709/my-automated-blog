    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing the Choux Pastry</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). In a medium saucepan, combine the water, butter, and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and add the gluten-free flour blend all at once. Stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball and pulls away from the sides of the pan. Remove the pan from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Adding the Eggs</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has cooled slightly, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. The dough should be smooth and glossy. Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Pipe the dough into 4-inch logs onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving space between each eclair.</p>

    <h3>3. Baking the Eclairs</h3>
    <p>Bake the eclairs in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until they are golden brown and puffed. Do not open the oven door during baking, as this can cause the eclairs to collapse. Once baked, remove the eclairs from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack.</p>

    <h3>4. Preparing the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the eclairs are cooling, prepare the filling. In a large bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract, and continue to whip until stiff peaks form. Transfer the whipped cream to a piping bag fitted with a small round tip.</p>

    <h3>5. Assembling the Eclairs</h3>
    <p>Once the eclairs are completely cool, use a sharp knife to make a small slit in the side of each eclair. Pipe the whipped cream filling into the eclairs through the slit. Be careful not to overfill, as this can cause the eclairs to burst.</p>

    <h3>6. Making the Chocolate Glaze</h3>
    <p>To make the chocolate glaze, melt the dark chocolate and milk together in a microwave-safe bowl or over a double boiler. Stir until smooth. Dip the top of each eclair into the chocolate glaze, allowing the excess to drip off. Place the eclairs on a wire rack to set.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary slightly. A blend that includes rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch usually works well for choux pastry.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the eclairs ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the eclairs a day in advance. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator and add the filling and glaze just before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the eclairs?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the unfilled eclairs for up to a month. Thaw them at room temperature before filling and glazing.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of whipped cream for the filling?</h3>
        <p>You can use pastry cream, custard, or even a dairy-free alternative like coconut cream for the filling.</p>
    </div>
