    <p>Eclairs are a classic French pastry that has been enjoyed for centuries.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). In a medium saucepan, combine the water, butter, and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Once the butter has melted and the mixture is boiling, reduce the heat to low and add the almond flour and tapioca flour. Stir continuously until the dough forms a ball and pulls away from the sides of the pan. Remove the pan from the heat and let the dough cool for a few minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Adding the Eggs</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has cooled slightly, add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. The dough should be smooth and glossy. If the dough is too stiff, you can add a little more water, one tablespoon at a time, until you reach the desired consistency.</p>

    <h3>3. Piping the Eclairs</h3>
    <p>Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Pipe the dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, forming 4-inch long logs. Make sure to leave enough space between each eclair to allow for expansion during baking.</p>

    <h3>4. Baking the Eclairs</h3>
    <p>Bake the eclairs in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until they are golden brown and puffed up. Do not open the oven door during the first 20 minutes of baking, as this can cause the eclairs to collapse. Once baked, remove the eclairs from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack.</p>

    <h3>5. Preparing the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the eclairs are cooling, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract, and continue to whip until stiff peaks form. Transfer the whipped cream to a piping bag fitted with a small round tip.</p>

    <h3>6. Filling the Eclairs</h3>
    <p>Once the eclairs have cooled, use a sharp knife to make a small slit in the side of each eclair. Insert the piping bag tip into the slit and fill the eclair with the whipped cream. Be careful not to overfill, as this can cause the eclair to burst.</p>

    <h3>7. Adding the Chocolate Glaze</h3>
    <p>To make the chocolate glaze, melt the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water. Stir until smooth and glossy. Dip the top of each eclair into the melted chocolate, allowing the excess to drip off. Place the eclairs on a wire rack to set.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours such as rice flour or coconut flour. However, the texture may vary, so it’s best to stick with the recommended almond and tapioca flour blend for the best results.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free eclairs?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free eclairs are best enjoyed fresh, but they can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Allow them to come to room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free eclairs?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the unfilled eclairs for up to 1 month. Thaw them at room temperature before filling and glazing.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free eclairs are a delightful treat that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and techniques, you can create light, airy, and delicious eclairs that rival the traditional version. Whether you’re new to gluten-free baking or a seasoned pro, this recipe is sure to impress.
