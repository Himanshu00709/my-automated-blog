    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your own batch of gluten-free chocolate sugar cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Set your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Cookies:</strong> Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of dough, roll them into balls, and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Flatten slightly with your hand or a fork.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll achieve perfect cookies every time:</p>
    <ul>
