    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your cobbler bakes evenly and achieves that golden-brown crust we all love.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Peaches</h3>
    <p>Drain the canned peaches, reserving about 1/4 cup of the syrup or juice. Place the peaches in a baking dish and sprinkle them with a little sugar and cinnamon to enhance their natural sweetness.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut in the cold butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract until just combined. The batter should be thick but pourable.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter over the peaches in the baking dish, spreading it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cobbler to cool slightly before serving. It pairs wonderfully with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra indulgent treat.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Peach Cobbler</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking to ensure the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> If your canned peaches are already sweetened, you may want to reduce the amount of sugar in the topping to balance the flavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Spices:</strong> While cinnamon is a classic choice, you can also try adding a pinch of nutmeg or cardamom for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh peaches instead of canned?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh peaches if they are in season. Simply peel and slice the peaches, then cook them with a bit of sugar and water until they soften before using them in the recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and use a non-dairy milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the cobbler?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked cobbler for up to 2 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and reheat in the oven.</p>
