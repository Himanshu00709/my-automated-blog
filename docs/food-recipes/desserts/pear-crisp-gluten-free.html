    <h1>Gluten-Free Pear Crisp: A Delicious and Healthy Dessert</h1>
    <p>When it comes to desserts, finding a balance between indulgence and health can be challenging. However, gluten-free pear crisp is a delightful exception.

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Pear Crisp?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free desserts have gained popularity in recent years, and for good reason. Many people experience digestive discomfort or other health issues when consuming gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.

Pear crisp is an excellent choice because pears are naturally gluten-free, and the topping can easily be made with gluten-free oats and flour.</p>

    <p>Additionally, pears are packed with nutrients such as fiber, vitamin C, and potassium. They are also low in calories, making them a healthier option compared to other fruits used in desserts. The combination of sweet, juicy pears and a crispy, buttery topping creates a dessert that is both satisfying and nutritious.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free pear crisp:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your pear crisp bakes evenly and achieves the perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Pears</h3>
    <p>Peel and slice the pears into thin, even pieces. Place them in a large mixing bowl and toss with a tablespoon of coconut sugar and a pinch of cinnamon. This step enhances the natural sweetness of the pears and adds a hint of spice.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free oats, almond flour, remaining coconut sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Mix well. Cut in the cold butter (or coconut oil) using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. This will create the perfect crispy topping for your dessert.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Spread the prepared pears evenly in a baking dish. Sprinkle the oat mixture over the top, covering the pears completely. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the pears are tender.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the pear crisp to cool for a few minutes before serving. It pairs wonderfully with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra indulgent treat.</p>
