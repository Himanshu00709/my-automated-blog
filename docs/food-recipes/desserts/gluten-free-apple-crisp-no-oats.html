    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free apple crisp without oats:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Apples</h3>
    <p>Start by peeling, coring, and slicing the apples into thin, even slices. Toss the apple slices with lemon juice to prevent browning and add a hint of tanginess. Set aside while you prepare the crisp topping.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Crisp Topping</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. This will create the perfect texture for your crisp topping.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Apple Crisp</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Arrange the apple slices in an even layer in a baking dish. Sprinkle the crisp topping evenly over the apples, ensuring that all the slices are covered. This will create a golden, crunchy crust as it bakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the apples are tender. The aroma of cinnamon and baked apples will fill your kitchen, signaling that your dessert is ready.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the apple crisp to cool slightly before serving. It pairs wonderfully with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. Enjoy this gluten-free treat with family and friends!</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. The texture and flavor will remain delicious.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover apple crisp in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts to the topping?</h3>
        <p>Yes, adding chopped nuts like almonds or pecans to the crisp topping can add a delightful crunch and extra flavor. Just be sure to check for any nut allergies before serving.</p>
