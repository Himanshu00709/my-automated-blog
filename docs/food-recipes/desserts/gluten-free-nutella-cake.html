    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the process of making this gluten-free Nutella cake. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a perfect result every time.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper to prevent the cake from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes using an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Incorporate Nutella</h3>
    <p>Add the Nutella to the butter mixture and mix until fully combined. The batter will be thick and rich at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Alternate Dry Ingredients and Milk</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and serve with a dollop of whipped cream or a drizzle of extra Nutella for an extra indulgent touch.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Nutella Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. However, make sure it’s a 1:1 substitute for all-purpose flour to ensure the right texture.</p>

        <h3>2. Is Nutella really gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, Nutella is gluten-free as it does not contain any wheat, barley, or rye. However, always check the label to ensure there are no cross-contamination risks if you have celiac disease.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil, and use a dairy-free milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>4. How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>
