    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Mix well to ensure there are no lumps. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a smooth batter forms. Gently fold in the diced peaches, being careful not to overmix.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Preheat the Air Fryer</h3>
    <p>Preheat your air fryer to 375°F (190°C) for about 5 minutes. This step is crucial for achieving a crispy exterior on your fritters.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Form the Fritters</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop portions of the batter onto a piece of parchment paper. Each fritter should be about 2-3 tablespoons in size. Lightly spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray or brush with a small amount of oil to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Fritters</h3>
    <p>Place the fritters in the air fryer basket, leaving space between each one to allow for even cooking. Cook for 8-10 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the fritters are golden brown and cooked through. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook the fritters in batches.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the fritters are done, remove them from the air fryer and let them cool slightly. Serve warm with a dusting of powdered sugar, a drizzle of honey, or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra indulgent treat.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Peach Fritters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Ripe Peaches:</strong> The sweetness and juiciness of ripe peaches will enhance the flavor of your fritters. If fresh peaches are not available, you can use frozen peaches, but make sure to thaw and drain them well before using.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense fritters. Mix the batter just until the ingredients are combined, and then gently fold in the peaches.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Cooking Time:</strong> Cooking times may vary depending on the size of your fritters and the model of your air fryer. Keep an eye on them and adjust the cooking time as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> While powdered sugar is a classic topping, you can also try cinnamon sugar, a glaze made from powdered sugar and milk, or even a scoop of vanilla ice cream for a decadent dessert.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While peaches are the star of this recipe, you can easily substitute them with other fruits like apples, berries, or even bananas. Just make sure to adjust the cooking time if the fruit has a different moisture content.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these fritters ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the batter ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. When you’re ready to cook, simply give the batter a quick stir and proceed with the recipe as usual.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover fritters?</h3>
        <p>Leftover fritters can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. To reheat, place them in the air fryer for a few minutes until warmed through.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze these fritters?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cooked fritters. Allow them to cool completely, then place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze until solid. Transfer the frozen fritters to a zip-top bag or airtight container and store for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply place them in the air fryer at 350°F (175°C) for 5-7 minutes.</p>
