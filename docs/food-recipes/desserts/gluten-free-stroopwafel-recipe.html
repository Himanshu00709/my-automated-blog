    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by combining the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with the milk, until a soft dough forms. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Cook the Waffles</h3>
    <p>Preheat your stroopwafel iron or a regular waffle iron. Divide the dough into small balls, about the size of a walnut. Place one ball in the center of the iron and close the lid, pressing down gently. Cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until the waffles are golden brown and crispy. Remove the waffles carefully and let them cool slightly before slicing them in half horizontally.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Stroopwafels</h3>
    <p>While the waffles are still warm, spread a generous layer of caramel filling on one half of each waffle. Place the other half on top, pressing gently to sandwich the filling. Allow the stroopwafels to cool completely before serving. The caramel will set as they cool, creating the perfect texture.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Stroopwafels</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't skip the xanthan gum:</strong> Xanthan gum helps bind the dough, giving it the elasticity needed to create thin, crispy waffles.</li>
        <li><strong>Work quickly with the dough:</strong> Gluten-free dough can dry out faster than traditional dough, so keep it covered when not in use.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with fillings:</strong> While caramel is traditional, you can also try chocolate, honey, or even fruit preserves for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make stroopwafels without a stroopwafel iron?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a regular waffle iron, but the waffles may be thicker than traditional stroopwafels. Adjust the cooking time accordingly to achieve the desired crispiness.</p>

        <h3>How do I store gluten-free stroopwafels?</h3>
        <p>Store your stroopwafels in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 2 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a dairy-free alternative for the butter and milk?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the butter with a plant-based alternative and use almond, soy, or oat milk to make the recipe dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>Why is my dough too sticky?</h3>
        <p>If your dough is too sticky, add a little more gluten-free flour, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the right consistency. Be careful not to overwork the dough.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free stroopwafels at home is a rewarding experience that allows you to enjoy this classic treat without compromising on taste or texture. With the right ingredients and a bit of patience, you can create a batch of stroopwafels that are just as delicious as the traditional version. Whether you're serving them with a cup of coffee or gifting them to a friend, these gluten-free stroopwafels are sure to impress. Happy baking!</p>
