    <h1>Gluten-Free Peach Coffee Cake: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>When it comes to baking, gluten-free options have become increasingly popular, not just for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but for anyone looking to enjoy a healthier lifestyle. One such delightful creation is the gluten-free peach coffee cake. This moist, flavorful cake combines the natural sweetness of peaches with a tender crumb, making it the perfect accompaniment to your morning coffee or afternoon tea. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free baking, the key ingredients for this recipe, and step-by-step instructions to create your own gluten-free peach coffee cake.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Baking?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has gained traction for several reasons. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, avoiding gluten is essential to prevent adverse health effects. However, even for those without gluten-related issues, gluten-free baking can offer benefits such as improved digestion, reduced inflammation, and a lighter, less dense texture in baked goods. Additionally, gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, and oat flour are often richer in nutrients compared to traditional wheat flour, providing a healthier alternative without compromising on taste.</p>

    <h2>Key Ingredients for Gluten-Free Peach Coffee Cake</h2>
    <p>Creating a gluten-free peach coffee cake requires a careful selection of ingredients to ensure the cake is both delicious and safe for those avoiding gluten. Here’s a breakdown of the essential components:</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Peach Coffee Cake</h2>
    <p>Now that we’ve covered the key ingredients, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making this delectable gluten-free peach coffee cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 ½ cups of gluten-free flour blend, ½ cup of almond flour, 1 teaspoon of xanthan gum, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, ½ teaspoon of baking soda, and a pinch of salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure they are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together 2 large eggs, ½ cup of Greek yogurt, ½ cup of coconut sugar, and ¼ cup of melted coconut oil. Mix until the ingredients are well combined and the mixture is smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Fold in Peaches</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in 1 ½ cups of diced fresh peaches into the wet mixture. Be careful not to overmix, as this can cause the peaches to break down too much.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Overmixing can lead to a dense cake, so stop as soon as the batter comes together.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra treat.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Peach Coffee Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen peaches instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, frozen peaches can be used, but make sure to thaw and drain them thoroughly to avoid excess moisture in the cake.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I substitute almond flour with another gluten-free flour?</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>
    </div>
