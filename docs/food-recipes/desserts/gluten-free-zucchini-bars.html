    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free zucchini bars is a straightforward process that even beginner bakers can master. Follow these steps to create your own batch:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and greasing a baking dish with coconut oil or lining it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the zucchini:</strong> Grate the zucchini using a box grater or food processor. Once grated, place the zucchini in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much moisture as possible. This step is crucial to prevent the bars from becoming too soggy.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the wet ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, melted coconut oil, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the zucchini:</strong> Fold the grated zucchini into the batter, ensuring it’s evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and spread it evenly. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the bars to cool completely before cutting them into squares. Serve as is or with a drizzle of honey for extra sweetness.</li>
    </ol>
