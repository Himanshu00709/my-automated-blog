    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Cookie Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a smooth dough forms.</p>

    <h3>2. Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of dough and place them on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Flatten each dough ball slightly with the back of a spoon. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool completely on the baking sheet before transferring them to a wire rack.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Ice Cream Sandwiches</h3>
    <p>Once the cookies have cooled, it's time to assemble the ice cream sandwiches. Take a scoop of your favorite gluten-free ice cream and place it on the flat side of one cookie. Gently press another cookie on top to create a sandwich. Repeat this process with the remaining cookies and ice cream. For best results, place the assembled sandwiches in the freezer for at least 1 hour to firm up before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Ice Cream Sandwiches</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flour blends are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking cookies to ensure the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too soft, chilling it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before baking can help the cookies hold their shape better.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize Your Ice Cream:</strong> Feel free to experiment with different flavors of gluten-free ice cream. From classic vanilla to decadent chocolate, the possibilities are endless.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Roll the edges of your ice cream sandwiches in sprinkles, crushed nuts, or chocolate chips for an extra touch of flavor and texture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use store-bought gluten-free cookies?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can certainly use store-bought gluten-free cookies if you're short on time. Just make sure to check the label to ensure they are truly gluten-free and meet your dietary needs.</p>

        <h3>How long can I store these ice cream sandwiches?</h3>
        <p>These gluten-free ice cream sandwiches can be stored in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 2 weeks. Be sure to place parchment paper between layers to prevent them from sticking together.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these sandwiches dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative and use a dairy-free ice cream. Many gluten-free flour blends are naturally dairy-free, but always double-check the ingredients.</p>

        <h3>What if I don't have a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have a gluten-free flour blend, you can make your own by combining equal parts of almond flour, coconut flour, and tapioca flour. This blend works well for most gluten-free baking recipes.</p>
