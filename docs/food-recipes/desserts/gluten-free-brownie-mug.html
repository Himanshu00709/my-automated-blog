    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free brownie mug is incredibly simple. Follow these steps to create your delicious treat:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a microwave-safe mug, combine the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, and sugar. Stir until well mixed.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> Pour in the milk, oil (or melted butter), and vanilla extract. Mix until the batter is smooth and free of lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Chocolate Chips:</strong> If you’re using chocolate chips, fold them into the batter at this stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Microwave:</strong> Place the mug in the microwave and cook on high for 1 minute. Check the brownie—if it’s still too gooey, microwave for an additional 15-30 seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Let the brownie cool for a minute or two before digging in. Be careful—the mug will be hot!</li>

        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook:</strong> Microwaves vary in power, so start with 1 minute and add time in small increments to avoid overcooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add a pinch of cinnamon, a dash of espresso powder, or even a swirl of peanut butter for a unique twist.</li>
        <li><strong>Top It Off:</strong> Serve your brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a dollop of whipped cream, or a drizzle of caramel sauce for an extra indulgent treat.</li>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Brownie Mugs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make a gluten-free brownie mug without a microwave?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake your brownie mug in a conventional oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and bake for about 15-20 minutes, or until the brownie is set.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free flour on hand, you can use almond flour, oat flour, or even coconut flour. Keep in mind that coconut flour absorbs more liquid, so you may need to adjust the amount of milk or oil.</p>

        <h3>Can I make a vegan gluten-free brownie mug?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the milk with a plant-based alternative like almond milk or oat milk, and use a vegan-friendly oil or butter. You can also replace the sugar with a vegan sweetener like maple syrup or agave nectar.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover brownie mug?</h3>
        <p>If you somehow have leftovers, you can store the brownie in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. Reheat in the microwave for a few seconds before serving.</p>
