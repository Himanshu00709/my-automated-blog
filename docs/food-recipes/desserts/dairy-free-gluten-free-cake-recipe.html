<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's move on to the step-by-step instructions to bake this delicious cake.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with coconut oil and line it with parchment paper to prevent the cake from sticking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these dry ingredients together until well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted coconut oil, maple syrup, vanilla extract, almond milk, and apple cider vinegar. Add the eggs one at a time, whisking well after each addition.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake the Cake</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can frost the cake with your favorite dairy-free frosting or enjoy it as is.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>

    <h3>Can I make this cake vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) to make this cake vegan-friendly.</p>

    <h3>How should I store this cake?</h3>
    <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I add other flavors to this cake?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can customize this cake by adding flavors like lemon zest, cocoa powder, or even fresh berries to the batter.</p>
