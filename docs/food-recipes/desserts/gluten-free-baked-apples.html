    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Baked Apples</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create a delicious gluten-free baked apple dessert:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C). This will ensure that your apples bake evenly and develop a tender texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Apples</h3>
    <p>Wash the apples thoroughly and remove the cores, leaving the bottom intact to create a well for the filling. You can use a melon baller or a small knife to carefully remove the core. Make sure not to cut through the bottom of the apple.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, combine the gluten-free oats, almond flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Mix well to ensure that the ingredients are evenly distributed. If you are using raisins, dried cranberries, or chopped nuts, add them to the mixture at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Fill the Apples</h3>
    <p>Spoon the filling mixture into the hollowed-out centers of the apples, pressing down gently to pack the filling. Make sure to fill each apple generously, as the filling will settle as it bakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Butter</h3>
    <p>Place a small piece of butter (or a dairy-free alternative) on top of the filling in each apple. This will help to create a rich, caramelized flavor as the apples bake.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Apples</h3>
    <p>Place the filled apples in a baking dish and add a small amount of water to the bottom of the dish to prevent the apples from sticking. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes, or until the apples are tender and the filling is golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the apples are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving. You can enjoy them as is or top them with a dollop of whipped cream, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, or a drizzle of caramel sauce for an extra indulgent treat.</p>
