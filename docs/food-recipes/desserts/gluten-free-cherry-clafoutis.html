    <h1>Gluten-Free Cherry Clafoutis: A Delightful Dessert</h1>
    <p>Cherry clafoutis is a classic French dessert that combines the sweetness of cherries with a custard-like batter. Traditionally, this dish is made with wheat flour, but for those who follow a gluten-free diet, a few simple substitutions can make this dessert just as delicious. In this article, we’ll explore the history of clafoutis, the benefits of going gluten-free, and provide a step-by-step recipe for a gluten-free cherry clafoutis that will impress your guests.</p>

    <h2>The History of Clafoutis</h2>
    <p>Clafoutis originated in the Limousin region of France during the 19th century. The name "clafoutis" comes from the Occitan word "clafir," which means "to fill." Traditionally, this dessert is made by pouring a thick batter over fresh cherries and baking it until the top is golden brown. The result is a dessert that is both light and rich, with a texture that falls somewhere between a flan and a pancake.</p>
    <p>While cherries are the most common fruit used in clafoutis, other fruits like plums, apples, and pears can also be used. However, the classic cherry clafoutis remains the most beloved version of this dessert.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular in recent years, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among people looking to improve their overall health. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause digestive issues for some individuals. By opting for gluten-free alternatives, you can enjoy your favorite dishes without the discomfort that gluten may cause.</p>
    <p>In the case of clafoutis, using gluten-free flour allows you to create a dessert that is just as delicious as the traditional version, but without the gluten. This makes it a great option for those who need to avoid gluten but still want to enjoy a classic French dessert.</p>
