    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free white chocolate chip cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Set your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream butter and sugars:</strong> In a large bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add egg and vanilla:</strong> Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in white chocolate chips:</strong> Gently fold in the white chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and bake:</strong> Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit different from traditional baking, but with these tips, you’ll achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the right flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right balance of starches and proteins to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined to ensure a tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough:</strong> If your dough is too soft, chilling it for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch the baking time:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can go from perfectly baked to overdone quickly, so keep a close eye on them, especially during the last few minutes of baking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free White Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t need to avoid gluten, you can certainly use regular all-purpose flour in place of the gluten-free blend. However, if you’re baking for someone with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it’s important to stick with gluten-free ingredients to avoid any adverse reactions.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour blend for cookies?</h3>
        <p>There are many great gluten-free flour blends on the market, but some of the most popular for baking include Bob’s Red Mill 1-to-1 Baking Flour and King Arthur Measure for Measure Flour. These blends are designed to work well in a variety of baked goods, including cookies.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make these cookies dairy-free by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter, and using dairy-free white chocolate chips.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free cookies?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. For longer storage, you can freeze the baked cookies for up to three months.</p>
