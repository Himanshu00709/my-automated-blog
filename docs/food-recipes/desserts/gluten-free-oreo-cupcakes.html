    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get baking! Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free Oreo cupcakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with cupcake liners. This ensures that your cupcakes bake evenly and don’t stick to the pan.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make sure there are no lumps, as this will ensure a smooth batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense cupcakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fill the Cupcake Liners</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or an ice cream scoop, fill each cupcake liner about two-thirds full with the batter. This allows room for the cupcakes to rise without overflowing.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the cupcakes in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cupcakes to cool completely before frosting.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Frost and Decorate</h3>
    <p>Once the cupcakes are cool, pipe or spread the buttercream frosting on top. For an extra touch, place a gluten-free Oreo cookie on top of each cupcake or crumble some cookies over the frosting.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Oreo Cupcakes</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular Oreos instead of gluten-free Oreos?</h3>
        <p>No, regular Oreos contain gluten, so they are not suitable for a gluten-free diet. Be sure to use gluten-free Oreos to keep the recipe safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these cupcakes dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute dairy milk with a non-dairy alternative like almond milk or oat milk. Additionally, use a dairy-free buttercream frosting to make the cupcakes entirely dairy-free.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store these cupcakes?</h3>
        <p>Store the cupcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, refrigerate them for up to 5 days. Bring them to room temperature before serving for the best texture.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free Oreo cupcakes are a testament to the fact that dietary restrictions don’t have to mean sacrificing flavor or indulgence. With a rich chocolate base, creamy frosting, and the iconic crunch of gluten-free Oreos, these cupcakes are sure to be a hit at any gathering.
