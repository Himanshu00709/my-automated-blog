<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Cupcake Batter</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a muffin tin with cupcake liners. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the buttermilk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense cupcakes.</p>

<h3>2. Adding the Oreo Crunch</h3>

<p>Crush the gluten-free Oreo cookies into small pieces. You can do this by placing them in a plastic bag and using a rolling pin to crush them. Fold the crushed Oreos into the cupcake batter, reserving a small amount for garnish. This will give your cupcakes a delightful crunch and an extra layer of flavor.</p>

<h3>3. Baking the Cupcakes</h3>

<p>Fill each cupcake liner about two-thirds full with the batter. Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cupcakes to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

<h3>4. Making the Frosting</h3>

<p>While the cupcakes are cooling, prepare the frosting. In a large bowl, beat the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gradually add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract, and continue to beat until the frosting is smooth and creamy. If you prefer a thicker frosting, you can add more powdered sugar until you reach your desired consistency.</p>

<h3>5. Decorating the Cupcakes</h3>

<p>Once the cupcakes are completely cool, pipe or spread the frosting onto each cupcake. Garnish with the reserved crushed Oreo cookies for an extra touch of crunch and visual appeal. Serve immediately, or store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Oreo Cupcakes</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use regular Oreos if I don’t have gluten-free Oreos?</h3>
    <p>If you don’t have gluten-free Oreos, you can use regular Oreos, but keep in mind that they contain gluten. For a truly gluten-free dessert, it’s essential to use gluten-free Oreos or another gluten-free chocolate sandwich cookie.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I make these cupcakes dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make these cupcakes dairy-free by substituting the buttermilk with a dairy-free alternative like almond milk or coconut milk. For the frosting, you can use a dairy-free whipped topping or a frosting made with dairy-free butter and powdered sugar.</p>

    <h3>3. How do I store gluten-free Oreo cupcakes?</h3>
    <p>Store the cupcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. If you’re storing them in the fridge, allow them to come to room temperature before serving for the best texture and flavor.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I freeze these cupcakes?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze these cupcakes. Place them in a single layer in an airtight container and freeze for up to 2 months. Thaw them in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>
