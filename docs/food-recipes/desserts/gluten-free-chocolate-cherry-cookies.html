    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</li>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>Can I use fresh cherries instead of dried cherries?</h3>
        <p>While dried cherries are recommended for this recipe due to their concentrated flavor and chewy texture, you can use fresh cherries if you prefer. Just make sure to pit and chop them finely before adding them to the dough.</p>

        <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best for these cookies?</h3>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these cookies vegan by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative (like coconut oil or vegan butter) and using a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of a regular egg.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 3 months. Just make sure to thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>
