    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's walk through the process of making gluten-free cream puffs. Follow these steps carefully to ensure your cream puffs turn out perfectly.</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Choux Pastry</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). In a medium saucepan, combine the water, butter, and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Once the butter has melted and the mixture is boiling, reduce the heat to low and add the gluten-free flour blend all at once. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mixture forms a smooth ball and pulls away from the sides of the pan. This should take about 1-2 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Add the Eggs</h3>
    <p>Transfer the dough to a mixing bowl and let it cool for about 5 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. The dough should be smooth and glossy. If the dough becomes too stiff, you can add a little more water, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the right consistency.</p>

    <h3>3. Pipe the Dough</h3>
    <p>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a piping bag fitted with a large round tip, pipe the dough into small mounds, about 1.5 inches in diameter. Space them about 2 inches apart to allow for expansion. If you don't have a piping bag, you can use a spoon to drop the dough onto the baking sheet.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Cream Puffs</h3>
    <p>Bake the cream puffs in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and puffed up. Do not open the oven door during the first 15 minutes of baking, as this can cause the puffs to collapse. Once baked, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack.</p>

    <h3>5. Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the cream puffs are cooling, prepare the filling. In a mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract, and continue whipping until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to over-whip the cream, as it can become grainy.</p>

    <h3>6. Fill the Cream Puffs</h3>
    <p>Once the cream puffs are completely cool, use a sharp knife to cut a small slit in the side of each puff. Using a piping bag fitted with a small round tip, fill each puff with the whipped cream. Alternatively, you can use a spoon to fill the puffs if you don't have a piping bag.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but make sure they contain xanthan gum or add it separately. Xanthan gum helps to bind the dough and gives it the right texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the cream puffs ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake the cream puffs ahead of time and store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. Fill them with cream just before serving to prevent them from becoming soggy.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the cream puffs?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the unfilled cream puffs for up to 1 month. Thaw them at room temperature before filling and serving.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of whipped cream for the filling?</h3>
        <p>You can use pastry cream, chocolate ganache, or even a dairy-free alternative like coconut cream for the filling. The possibilities are endless!</p>

With a light and airy choux pastry and a creamy filling, these cream puffs are sure to impress your family and friends. Whether you're new to gluten-free baking or a seasoned pro, this recipe is a must-try. So, roll up your sleeves, gather your ingredients, and get ready to bake a batch of these delicious gluten-free cream puffs. Bon appétit!</p>
