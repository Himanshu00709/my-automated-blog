    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these gluten-free pumpkin cheesecake bars:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a medium-sized bowl, combine the almond flour, crushed gluten-free graham crackers, and melted butter. Mix until the ingredients are well combined and the mixture resembles wet sand. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a greased 9x9 inch baking pan, making sure to create an even layer. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Cheesecake Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until it's smooth and creamy. Add the granulated sugar and continue to beat until the mixture is well combined. Next, add the pumpkin puree, eggs, vanilla extract, and pumpkin pie spice. Mix until everything is fully incorporated and the filling is smooth. Be careful not to overmix, as this can introduce too much air into the batter, which may cause the cheesecake to crack during baking.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the cheesecake filling over the pre-baked crust, spreading it out evenly with a spatula. Place the pan back into the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle. Once baked, remove the pan from the oven and let it cool to room temperature. Then, transfer the pan to the refrigerator and chill for at least 4 hours, or overnight, to allow the cheesecake to set completely.</p>

    <h3>4. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the cheesecake bars are fully chilled, remove them from the refrigerator and cut them into squares. For an extra touch of indulgence, you can top each bar with a dollop of whipped cream or a sprinkle of cinnamon. Serve and enjoy your gluten-free pumpkin cheesecake bars with friends and family!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these bars dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these bars dairy-free by substituting the cream cheese with a dairy-free alternative, such as vegan cream cheese, and using a plant-based butter for the crust. Be sure to check the labels to ensure all ingredients are dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How long do these bars last in the fridge?</h3>
        <p>These gluten-free pumpkin cheesecake bars can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 2 months. Just be sure to thaw them in the refrigerator before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin puree?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer to use fresh pumpkin, simply roast a small sugar pumpkin, remove the flesh, and puree it in a food processor until smooth. Make sure to drain any excess moisture from the puree before using it in the recipe.</p>
    </div>

With a nutty, buttery crust and a creamy, spiced pumpkin filling, these bars are sure to become a seasonal favorite.
