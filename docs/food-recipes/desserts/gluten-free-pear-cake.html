    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in the yogurt and diced pears until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Sprinkle the top with cinnamon for added flavor. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>6. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature, optionally with a dollop of whipped cream or a dusting of powdered sugar.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Pear Cake</h2>

    <p>This gluten-free pear cake is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Pears are a great source of dietary fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidants. Almond flour adds healthy fats and protein, while the absence of gluten makes this cake easier to digest for those with gluten sensitivities. Additionally, using yogurt in the recipe provides probiotics, which are beneficial for gut health.</p>

        <h3>Can I use other fruits instead of pears?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute pears with other fruits like apples, peaches, or even berries. Just make sure to adjust the baking time accordingly, as different fruits may release more or less moisture.</p>
