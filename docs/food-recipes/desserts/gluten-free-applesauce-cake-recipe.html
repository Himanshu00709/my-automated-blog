    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make this gluten-free applesauce cake:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the unsweetened applesauce, granulated sugar, eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and serve. You can enjoy it as is or with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Applesauce Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use homemade applesauce?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Homemade applesauce can be a great option if you prefer to control the sweetness and texture. Just make sure it's unsweetened and smooth for the best results.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute the sugar with a healthier alternative?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute granulated sugar with coconut sugar, maple syrup, or even a sugar-free sweetener like stevia. Keep in mind that the texture and sweetness may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or raisins to the cake?</h3>
        <p>Certainly! Adding nuts like walnuts or pecans, or even raisins, can add a delightful texture and flavor to the cake. Just fold them into the batter before baking.</p>
