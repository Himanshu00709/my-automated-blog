    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free peanut butter cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch round cake pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Peanut Butter:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, then mix in the peanut butter until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Cake</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free peanut butter cake turns out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that is specifically designed for baking to achieve the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking the cake a few minutes before the recommended baking time.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Consider adding a peanut butter glaze, chocolate drizzle, or a sprinkle of chopped peanuts for extra flavor and texture.</li>
    </ul>
