    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the process of baking your gluten-free lemon bundt cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease your bundt pan thoroughly with butter or non-stick spray, ensuring every nook and cranny is covered to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes with an electric mixer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Flavorings:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with the Greek yogurt. Mix until just combined—be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared bundt pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 15 minutes before inverting it onto a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with powdered sugar or drizzle with a lemon glaze for added sweetness.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Lemon Bundt Cake</h2>
    <p>Baking a gluten-free cake can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll achieve a perfect result every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense and gummy texture. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Cake Cool Completely:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be more delicate than their gluten-containing counterparts. Allowing the cake to cool completely before slicing ensures it holds its shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Add a Lemon Glaze:</strong> For an extra burst of lemon flavor, mix powdered sugar with fresh lemon juice and drizzle it over the cooled cake.</li>
    </ul>
