    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut flour, granulated sugar, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to blend the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Press the mixture evenly into the bottom of a greased 9x13 inch baking pan. Bake the crust for 10-12 minutes, or until it is lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the eggs, brown sugar, maple syrup, and vanilla extract until well combined. Stir in the chopped pecans. Pour the filling over the pre-baked crust, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Return the pan to the oven and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes, or until the filling is set and the edges are golden brown.</p>

    <h3>3. Cooling and Serving</h3>
    <p>Once the bars are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely in the pan. This will allow the filling to set properly. Once cooled, cut the bars into squares or rectangles and serve. For an extra touch, you can dust the bars with powdered sugar or serve them with a dollop of whipped cream.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pecan Pie Bars</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free pecan pie bars turn out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Butter:</strong> Cold butter helps create a flaky crust. Make sure your butter is well-chilled before incorporating it into the flour mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Crust:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a tough crust. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Bars Cool Completely:</strong> Allowing the bars to cool completely before cutting ensures that the filling sets properly and makes for cleaner slices.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Store the bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or refrigerate for up to a week.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours such as oat flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these bars ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! These bars can be made a day or two in advance. Just store them in an airtight container and they'll stay fresh.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free pecan pie bars?</h3>
        <p>Yes, these bars freeze well. Wrap them individually in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe container. They can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Are these bars suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This particular recipe contains eggs and butter, so it is not vegan. However, you can try substituting the eggs with a flax egg and using a vegan butter alternative to make a vegan version.</p>
    </div>
