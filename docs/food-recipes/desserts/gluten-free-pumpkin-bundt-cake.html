    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making your gluten-free pumpkin bundt cake:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease your bundt pan thoroughly with non-stick cooking spray or butter, making sure to get into all the crevices to ensure your cake releases easily after baking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves. This ensures that the spices are evenly distributed throughout the cake.</p>

    <h3>3. Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract until well combined. The mixture should be smooth and slightly thick.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cake. The batter should be thick but pourable.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared bundt pan, spreading it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. The cake should be golden brown and spring back when lightly touched.</p>

    <h3>6. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 15 minutes before inverting it onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can dust the cake with powdered sugar or drizzle it with a simple glaze made from powdered sugar and milk.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. Almond flour or oat flour can be used, but they may require additional binding agents like xanthan gum.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter in the recipe with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. The cake will still be moist and delicious.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or chocolate chips?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add chopped nuts like pecans or walnuts, or even chocolate chips to the batter for added texture and flavor. Just fold them in gently before pouring the batter into the pan.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

With its moist texture, warm spices, and rich pumpkin flavor, it's a treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions.
