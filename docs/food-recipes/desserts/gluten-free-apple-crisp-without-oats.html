    <h1>Gluten-Free Apple Crisp Without Oats: A Delicious and Healthy Dessert</h1>
    <p>Apple crisp is a classic dessert that brings warmth and comfort to any table.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Apples</h3>
    <p>Start by peeling and slicing the apples into thin, even slices. Toss the apple slices with lemon juice to prevent browning and enhance the flavor. Add granulated sugar and ground cinnamon, mixing well to coat the apples evenly.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Crisp Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and brown sugar. Add the cold butter pieces and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. If you’re using nuts, fold them into the topping mixture for added crunch and flavor.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread the prepared apple mixture evenly in a baking dish. Sprinkle the crisp topping over the apples, covering them completely. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the apples are tender.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Apple Crisp</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Apples:</strong> Use a mix of sweet and tart apples like Honeycrisp, Granny Smith, or Fuji for a balanced flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Ensure your flour blend is certified gluten-free to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter Temperature:</strong> Keep the butter cold for a flakier, crispier topping.</li>
        <li><strong>Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to add raisins, dried cranberries, or a pinch of nutmeg for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a plant-based alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter to make this recipe vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this apple crisp?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Assemble the apple crisp in a freezer-safe dish, cover tightly with plastic wrap and foil, and freeze for up to 3 months. Bake directly from frozen, adding extra time as needed.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of nuts?</h3>
        <p>If you’re allergic to nuts or simply prefer not to use them, you can omit them entirely or replace them with seeds like sunflower or pumpkin seeds.</p>
