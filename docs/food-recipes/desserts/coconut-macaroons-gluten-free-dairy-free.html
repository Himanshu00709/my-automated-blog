    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your own batch of gluten-free and dairy-free coconut macaroons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (165°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the shredded coconut, sugar, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Gently fold the egg whites into the coconut mixture, ensuring everything is well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Macaroons:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or your hands, form the mixture into small mounds and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Make sure to space them evenly to allow for even baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the macaroons for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Keep an eye on them to prevent over-baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the macaroons to cool completely on the baking sheet before serving. Enjoy them as is or dip the bottoms in melted dairy-free chocolate for an extra treat!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Coconut Macaroons</h2>
    <p>Coconut macaroons are not only delicious but also offer several nutritional benefits. Coconut is rich in healthy fats, particularly medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are known for their energy-boosting properties. Additionally, coconut is a good source of fiber, which aids in digestion. When made with natural sweeteners like coconut sugar, these macaroons can be a healthier alternative to traditional desserts.</p>
