    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten and sugar-free pumpkin muffins:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with coconut oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the almond flour, baking powder, pumpkin spice, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs, maple syrup, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the Muffin Tin:</strong> Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or store in an airtight container for later.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>
    <p>These gluten and sugar-free pumpkin muffins are not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Almond flour provides a good source of healthy fats and protein, while pumpkin puree is rich in vitamins A and C, as well as fiber. The use of natural sweeteners like maple syrup helps keep the sugar content low, making these muffins a healthier alternative to traditional baked goods.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and moisture content may vary, so you may need to adjust the recipe accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a sugar substitute?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer to avoid maple syrup, you can use other natural sweeteners like stevia or monk fruit. Just be sure to adjust the quantity based on the sweetness level of the substitute.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for longer storage—just wrap them individually and place them in a freezer-safe bag.</p>

        <h3>Are these muffins suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe includes eggs, so it’s not vegan. However, you can try substituting the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) to make a vegan version.</p>
