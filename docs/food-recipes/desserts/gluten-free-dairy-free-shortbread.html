    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the recipe. Follow these steps to create your own gluten-free dairy-free shortbread:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). This ensures that your shortbread bakes evenly and achieves the perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of gluten-free flour blend, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, and a pinch of salt. Add 1/2 cup of softened plant-based butter and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Mix until the dough comes together. If the dough is too crumbly, you can add a tablespoon of non-dairy milk to help bind it.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Dough</h3>
    <p>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) and shape it into a log or rectangle, depending on your preference. You can also press the dough into a baking pan if you prefer to cut it into squares or rectangles after baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Chill the Dough</h3>
    <p>Wrap the shaped dough in plastic wrap and chill it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Chilling helps the dough firm up, making it easier to slice and preventing it from spreading too much during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Shortbread</h3>
    <p>Once chilled, slice the dough into 1/4-inch thick pieces and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake, as gluten-free baked goods can dry out quickly.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the shortbread to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your gluten-free dairy-free shortbread with a cup of tea or coffee!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Shortbread</h2>

    <p>Here are some additional tips to ensure your shortbread turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will provide the best texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough shortbread. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> While traditional shortbread is simple, you can add your own twist by incorporating flavors like citrus zest, cinnamon, or even chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Gluten-free dairy-free shortbread can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze the cookies and thaw them as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Shortbread</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, almond flour can be used, but it will result in a denser, more crumbly texture. If you prefer a lighter shortbread, stick to a gluten-free flour blend.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of plant-based butter?</h3>
        <p>Coconut oil is a great alternative to plant-based butter. Just make sure it’s softened to room temperature before using it in the recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>This recipe is already vegan as long as you use plant-based butter and ensure that your powdered sugar is vegan (some brands use bone char in the refining process).</p>

        <h3>Why is my shortbread too crumbly?</h3>
        <p>If your shortbread is too crumbly, it may be due to not enough moisture in the dough. Try adding a tablespoon of non-dairy milk to help bind the ingredients together.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free dairy-free shortbread is a wonderful way to enjoy a classic treat without compromising on dietary needs. With the right ingredients and techniques, you can create a cookie that is just as delicious and satisfying as the traditional version. Whether you’re baking for yourself, a loved one with dietary restrictions, or simply looking to try something new, this recipe is sure to become a favorite. So, preheat your oven, gather your ingredients, and get ready to enjoy a batch of inclusive, delectable shortbread!</p>
