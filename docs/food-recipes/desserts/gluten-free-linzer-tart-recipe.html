    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that we have all the ingredients ready, let's move on to the step-by-step instructions to make the perfect gluten-free Linzer tart.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, and powdered sugar. Add the cold, cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Add the egg yolks, vanilla extract, and salt, and mix until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has chilled, remove it from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). On a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour), roll out the dough to about 1/4 inch thickness. Use a round cookie cutter to cut out the base of the tarts and a smaller cutter to create the tops with a cut-out design.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Tarts</h3>
    <p>Place the base rounds on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread a thin layer of raspberry jam (or your preferred jam) on each base, leaving a small border around the edges. Place the cut-out tops over the jam-covered bases and gently press the edges to seal. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cool and Dust</h3>
    <p>Allow the tarts to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, dust the tops with powdered sugar for a classic Linzer tart finish.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free baked goods can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be able to achieve the perfect Linzer tart:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for creating a flaky, tender crust. Make sure your butter is straight from the fridge.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overwork the Dough:</strong> Overworking the dough can lead to a tough crust. Mix just until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Chilling the dough helps prevent it from spreading too much during baking, ensuring your tarts hold their shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Jams:</strong> While raspberry jam is traditional, feel free to experiment with other flavors like apricot, blackberry, or even a citrus marmalade.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. A combination of gluten-free all-purpose flour and almond flour works best for this recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! The dough can be made a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator. Just make sure to let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes before rolling it out.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the Linzer tarts?</h3>
        <p>Store the tarts in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. If you need to store them longer, you can freeze them for up to a month. Just make sure to thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of jam?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any jam you prefer. Raspberry jam is traditional, but apricot, blackberry, or even a citrus marmalade would work beautifully.</p>
