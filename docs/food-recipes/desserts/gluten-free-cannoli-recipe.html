    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing the Cannoli Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by combining the gluten-free flour and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Add the cold, cubed butter and use your fingers or a pastry cutter to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Next, add the egg yolk and white wine vinegar, mixing until the dough begins to come together. Gradually add cold water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough forms a ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Rolling and Cutting the Dough</h3>
    <p>After the dough has rested, roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking) until it’s about 1/8 inch thick. Use a round cookie cutter or a glass to cut out circles of dough, approximately 4 inches in diameter. Wrap each circle around a cannoli mold, sealing the edges with a dab of water or egg white to ensure they stay closed during frying.</p>

    <h3>3. Frying the Cannoli Shells</h3>
    <p>Heat vegetable oil in a deep skillet or pot to 375°F (190°C). Carefully place the cannoli shells into the hot oil, frying them until they are golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove the shells from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Allow them to cool completely before removing the molds.</p>

    <h3>4. Making the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the shells are cooling, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the drained ricotta cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract. Mix until smooth and creamy. Fold in the mini chocolate chips and orange zest, if using. Transfer the filling to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip.</p>

    <h3>5. Assembling the Cannoli</h3>
    <p>Once the shells are completely cool, carefully pipe the ricotta filling into both ends of each shell until it’s fully filled. Dust the cannoli with powdered sugar and garnish with additional chocolate chips or chopped pistachios if desired. Serve immediately for the best texture and flavor.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cannoli</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make the cannoli shells ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the cannoli shells a day in advance. Store them in an airtight container at room temperature. However, it’s best to fill them just before serving to maintain their crispiness.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of ricotta cheese?</h3>
        <p>If you’re not a fan of ricotta, you can substitute it with mascarpone cheese or a mixture of cream cheese and whipped cream for a lighter filling.</p>

        <h3>Can I bake the cannoli shells instead of frying?</h3>
        <p>While frying gives the shells their traditional crispiness, you can bake them at 375°F (190°C) for about 10-12 minutes. Keep an eye on them to prevent over-browning.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover cannoli?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover cannoli in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Note that the shells may soften over time, so it’s best to enjoy them fresh.</p>
