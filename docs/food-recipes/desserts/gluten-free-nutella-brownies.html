    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to make your gluten-free Nutella brownies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking pan and line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Melt the butter:</strong> In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the unsalted butter. Once melted, let it cool slightly before adding it to the other ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the wet ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the melted butter, Nutella, granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract. Mix until smooth and well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, salt, and baking powder. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the brownies:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan before cutting them into squares. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Nutella Brownies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your brownies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use high-quality gluten-free flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking to achieve the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense brownies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Brownies are done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. If it comes out clean, the brownies may be overbaked.</li>
        <li><strong>Let them cool:</strong> Allowing the brownies to cool completely in the pan helps them set and makes them easier to cut.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use almond flour or oat flour as a substitute for gluten-free flour. However, the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the brownies?</h3>
        <p>Store the brownies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate them for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or chocolate chips?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Feel free to add chopped nuts, chocolate chips, or even a swirl of peanut butter to the batter for extra flavor and texture.</p>
