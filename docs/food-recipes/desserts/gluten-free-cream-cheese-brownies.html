    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free cream cheese brownies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang on the sides for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Brownie Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the melted butter and granulated sugar. Stir until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Cream Cheese Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth. Add the powdered sugar and mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Brownies</h3>
    <p>Pour the brownie batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly. Drop spoonfuls of the cream cheese mixture on top of the brownie batter. Use a knife or skewer to swirl the cream cheese into the brownie batter, creating a marbled effect.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Brownies</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Be careful not to overbake, as this can result in dry brownies.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan before lifting them out using the parchment paper overhang. Cut into squares and serve. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cream Cheese Brownies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free cream cheese brownies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense brownies. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Brownies are done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. If it comes out clean, they may be overbaked.</li>
        <li><strong>Let them cool completely:</strong> Allowing the brownies to cool completely before cutting will help them set and make them easier to slice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cream Cheese Brownies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don’t need the brownies to be gluten-free. However, if you’re catering to a gluten-free diet, it’s important to use a gluten-free flour blend.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these brownies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these brownies dairy-free by using dairy-free butter and cream cheese alternatives. Just make sure to check the labels to ensure they are gluten-free as well.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these brownies?</h3>
        <p>Store the brownies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or other mix-ins?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Feel free to add chopped nuts, chocolate chips, or other mix-ins to the brownie batter for added texture and flavor.</p>
