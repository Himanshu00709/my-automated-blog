    <h1>Gluten-Free Struffoli Recipe: A Delicious Twist on a Classic Italian Dessert</h1>

    <p>Struffoli, a traditional Italian dessert, is a festive treat often enjoyed during the holiday season. These small, golden balls of dough are deep-fried, coated in honey, and often decorated with colorful sprinkles or candied fruit. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying this classic dessert can be a challenge. That's where this gluten-free struffoli recipe comes in! This version retains all the deliciousness of the original while being completely gluten-free. Let’s dive into how you can make this delightful dessert at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Struffoli?</h2>

    <p>Struffoli, also known as "honey balls," is a Neapolitan dessert that has been enjoyed for centuries. The name "struffoli" comes from the Greek word "strongoulos," meaning "round in shape." These bite-sized dough balls are typically fried until golden and then coated in a sweet honey syrup. They are often shaped into a wreath or mound and decorated with festive toppings. Struffoli is a staple during Christmas and Easter celebrations in Italy, and it’s a dessert that brings families together.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

By using gluten-free flour in this struffoli recipe, everyone can enjoy this traditional dessert without compromising their health. Plus, gluten-free baking has come a long way, and with the right ingredients, you can achieve the same texture and flavor as the original.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour and xanthan gum (if needed). In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, softened butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and lemon zest. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a smooth dough forms. Knead the dough gently until it comes together. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Shape the Struffoli</h3>
    <p>After the dough has rested, divide it into small portions. Roll each portion into thin ropes, about 1/4 inch in diameter. Cut the ropes into small pieces, approximately 1/2 inch long. Roll each piece into a small ball. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Fry the Struffoli</h3>
    <p>Heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or pot to 350°F (175°C). Carefully add the dough balls in small batches, frying them until they are golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per batch. Use a slotted spoon to remove the struffoli from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Coat with Honey</h3>
    <p>In a large saucepan, warm the honey over low heat until it becomes thin and easy to pour. Add the fried struffoli to the honey, gently stirring to coat each ball evenly. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Assemble and Decorate</h3>
    <p>Once the struffoli are coated in honey, transfer them to a serving platter. Shape them into a wreath or mound, and decorate with sprinkles or candied fruit if desired. Allow the struffoli to set for at least 30 minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Struffoli</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours like almond flour or rice flour, but the texture may vary. A gluten-free all-purpose flour blend typically works best for this recipe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I bake the struffoli instead of frying?</h3>
        <p>While frying gives struffoli their traditional texture, you can bake them at 375°F (190°C) for 10-12 minutes. However, the result may be slightly different.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How long do gluten-free struffoli last?</h3>
        <p>Struffoli can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, keep them in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>
