    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free spice cookies:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, coconut flour, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream together the unsalted butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Egg and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until fully incorporated into the butter and sugar mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Shape the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a tablespoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Flatten each ball slightly with the back of a spoon or your fingers.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Spice Cookies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like oat flour or rice flour. However, keep in mind that different flours may alter the texture and flavor of the cookies.</p>

        <h3>2. How should I store gluten-free spice cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with coconut oil and use a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) instead of a regular egg.</p>

        <h3>4. Are these cookies suitable for people with nut allergies?</h3>
        <p>If you have a nut allergy, you can replace the almond flour with a nut-free flour like sunflower seed flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend.</p>
