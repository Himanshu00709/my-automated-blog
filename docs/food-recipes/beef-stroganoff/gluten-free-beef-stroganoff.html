    <h1>Gluten-Free Beef Stroganoff: A Delicious and Healthy Twist</h1>
    <p>Beef Stroganoff is a classic comfort food that has been enjoyed for generations. Traditionally made with beef, mushrooms, and a creamy sauce served over egg noodles, this dish is a favorite for many. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, the traditional recipe can be off-limits due to the use of flour and wheat-based noodles. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can create a gluten-free version of this beloved dish that is just as delicious and satisfying.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. A gluten-free diet is essential for managing these conditions. Additionally, some people choose to go gluten-free for other health reasons, such as reducing inflammation or improving digestion. Whatever your reason, gluten-free cooking doesn't have to mean sacrificing flavor or comfort.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the cooking process. Follow these steps to create a delicious gluten-free Beef Stroganoff:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Beef</h3>
    <p>Start by cutting the beef into thin strips. Season the beef with salt and pepper, then lightly coat it with gluten-free flour. This will help thicken the sauce later on. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil or butter. Cook the beef in batches until browned on all sides, then remove it from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of olive oil or butter. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add the minced garlic and sliced mushrooms, and cook until the mushrooms are tender and have released their moisture, about 5-7 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>Return the beef to the skillet with the vegetables. Sprinkle the remaining gluten-free flour over the mixture and stir to combine. Gradually pour in the beef broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the sauce has thickened, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in the sour cream and Dijon mustard (if using), and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until heated through.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve the gluten-free Beef Stroganoff over cooked gluten-free noodles. Garnish with fresh parsley or chives if desired. Enjoy your delicious, gluten-free comfort food!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Beef Stroganoff</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other cuts of beef, such as ribeye or flank steak. You can also substitute chicken or turkey for a lighter version of the dish.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have gluten-free flour, you can use cornstarch or arrowroot powder as a thickening agent. Mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of cold water and add it to the sauce.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the sour cream with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut cream or a dairy-free sour cream. Just make sure to adjust the seasoning to taste.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave, adding a splash of beef broth if the sauce has thickened too much.</p>
