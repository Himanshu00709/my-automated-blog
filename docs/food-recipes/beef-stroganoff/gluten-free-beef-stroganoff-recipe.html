    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Beef</h3>
    <p>Start by cutting the beef into thin strips. Season the beef with salt and pepper, then lightly coat it with gluten-free flour. This will help thicken the sauce later on.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Beef</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef strips and cook until they are browned on all sides. Remove the beef from the skillet and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté until the onion becomes translucent. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they are tender and have released their moisture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>Return the beef to the skillet and pour in the beef broth. Stir in the Dijon mustard and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let it cook for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Sour Cream</h3>
    <p>Reduce the heat to low and stir in the sour cream. Be careful not to let the sauce boil, as this could cause the sour cream to curdle. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the sauce is creamy and well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve</h3>
    <p>Serve the beef stroganoff over gluten-free pasta or rice. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired, and enjoy!</p>
