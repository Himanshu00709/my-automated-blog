    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Fish</h3>
    <p>Start by patting the fish fillets dry with a paper towel. Cut them into bite-sized pieces, about 1-2 inches wide. Season the fish lightly with salt and pepper.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Gluten-Free Batter</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. Gradually whisk in the sparkling water or gluten-free beer until the batter is smooth and slightly thick. The carbonation in the liquid will help create a light and crispy coating.</p>

    <h3>3. Coat and Cook the Fish</h3>
    <p>Heat a large skillet with about 1 inch of oil over medium-high heat. Dip each piece of fish into the batter, ensuring it’s fully coated, and carefully place it into the hot oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the fish and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</p>

    <h3>4. Warm the Tortillas</h3>
    <p>While the fish is cooking, warm the gluten-free corn tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave. This will make them more pliable and enhance their flavor.</p>

    <h3>5. Assemble the Tacos</h3>
    <p>Place a few pieces of fried fish on each tortilla. Top with shredded cabbage, avocado slices, and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro. Squeeze a lime wedge over the top and add a drizzle of gluten-free hot sauce or salsa for extra flavor.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Fish Tacos</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use fresh fish for the best flavor and texture.</li>
        <li>If you prefer a lighter option, you can bake the fish instead of frying it.</li>
        <li>Experiment with different gluten-free flours to find your preferred taste and texture.</li>
        <li>Add a dollop of gluten-free sour cream or Greek yogurt for extra creaminess.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fish Tacos</h2>
        <h3>1. Can I use frozen fish for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen fish, but make sure to thaw it completely and pat it dry before cooking to avoid excess moisture.</p>

        <h3>2. Are corn tortillas always gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Most corn tortillas are gluten-free, but it’s important to check the label to ensure they haven’t been cross-contaminated with gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This recipe is naturally dairy-free, but if you’re adding toppings like sour cream, opt for a dairy-free alternative.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store leftover fish tacos?</h3>
        <p>Store the fish and toppings separately in airtight containers in the refrigerator. Reheat the fish in the oven or skillet to maintain its crispiness.</p>
