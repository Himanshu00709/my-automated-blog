    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create a delicious gluten-free shrimp scampi:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gluten-free pasta and cook according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Shrimp:</strong> While the pasta is cooking, heat the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Shrimp:</strong> Add the shrimp to the skillet and cook until they turn pink and opaque, about 2-3 minutes per side. Be careful not to overcook the shrimp, as they can become rubbery.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Sauce:</strong> Pour in the white wine (or chicken broth) and lemon juice. Stir to combine and let the sauce simmer for 2-3 minutes. If you like a bit of heat, add the red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine and Serve:</strong> Add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss to coat it in the sauce. Sprinkle with fresh parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Shrimp Scampi</h2>
    <p>This dish is not only delicious but also packed with health benefits. Shrimp is a great source of lean protein and contains essential nutrients like selenium, vitamin B12, and omega-3 fatty acids. The garlic and olive oil provide heart-healthy fats, while the gluten-free pasta ensures that the dish is suitable for those with gluten sensitivities. Additionally, the lemon juice adds a boost of vitamin C, which supports the immune system.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Shrimp Scampi</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose High-Quality Gluten-Free Pasta:</strong> Not all gluten-free pastas are created equal. Look for brands made from brown rice, quinoa, or chickpea flour for the best texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook the Shrimp:</strong> Shrimp cook quickly, so keep an eye on them to avoid overcooking. They should be pink and slightly curled when done.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the Sauce to Your Liking:</strong> If you prefer a thicker sauce, you can add a bit of cornstarch slurry (1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water) to the skillet and simmer until thickened.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to add other ingredients like cherry tomatoes, spinach, or mushrooms to make the dish even more flavorful and nutritious.</li>
    </ul>
