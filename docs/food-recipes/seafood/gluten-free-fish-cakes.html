    <h1>Gluten-Free Fish Cakes: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>Fish cakes are a beloved dish in many cultures, offering a delightful combination of flavors and textures. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional fish cakes can be off-limits due to the use of breadcrumbs or flour as binding agents. Fortunately, gluten-free fish cakes are not only possible but can be just as delicious and satisfying. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free fish cakes, provide a step-by-step recipe, and answer some common questions about this versatile dish.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Fish Cakes?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free fish cakes are an excellent option for anyone looking to avoid gluten while still enjoying a flavorful and nutritious meal. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and other health problems for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. By using gluten-free alternatives, you can create fish cakes that are safe and enjoyable for everyone.</p>
    <p>Moreover, gluten-free fish cakes can be a healthier option, as they often incorporate nutrient-dense ingredients like quinoa, almond flour, or chickpea flour. These alternatives not only provide a gluten-free binding solution but also add extra protein, fiber, and essential vitamins to your meal.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free fish cakes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Fish:</strong> Start by poaching the fish fillets in lightly salted water for about 5-7 minutes, or until they are cooked through. Once done, drain the fish and let it cool. Flake the fish into small pieces, removing any bones or skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash the Potatoes:</strong> While the fish is cooling, mash the boiled potatoes until smooth. You can leave them slightly chunky if you prefer a more textured fish cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the flaked fish, mashed potatoes, gluten-free breadcrumbs, eggs, chopped parsley, lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Mix everything thoroughly until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Fish Cakes:</strong> Divide the mixture into equal portions and shape them into patties. You can make them as large or as small as you like, depending on your preference.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Fish Cakes:</strong> Heat the olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Carefully place the fish cakes in the pan and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Once cooked, remove the fish cakes from the pan and let them drain on a paper towel to remove any excess oil. Serve them with a side of gluten-free tartar sauce, a fresh salad, or your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
