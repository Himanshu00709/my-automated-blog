    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Shrimp Tacos</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Shrimp</h3>
    <p>Start by cleaning and deveining the shrimp. Pat them dry with a paper towel to ensure they cook evenly. Season the shrimp with a gluten-free spice blend, such as chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt. For added flavor, you can marinate the shrimp in lime juice and olive oil for 15-20 minutes before cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Shrimp</h3>
    <p>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and add a tablespoon of olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the shrimp in a single layer. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side until the shrimp turn pink and opaque. Be careful not to overcook, as shrimp can become rubbery.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Warm the Tortillas</h3>
    <p>While the shrimp are cooking, warm your gluten-free tortillas. You can do this in a dry skillet, on a grill, or in the microwave. Warming the tortillas makes them more pliable and enhances their flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Tacos</h3>
    <p>Place a few shrimp on each tortilla. Top with your choice of fresh vegetables, such as shredded cabbage, diced tomatoes, and sliced avocado. Drizzle with a gluten-free sauce, like a lime crema or a spicy salsa. Garnish with fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice for an extra burst of flavor.</p>
