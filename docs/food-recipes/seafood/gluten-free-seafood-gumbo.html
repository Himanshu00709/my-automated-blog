    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Seafood Gumbo</h2>
    <p>Now that we’ve covered the essential ingredients, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free seafood gumbo:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Gluten-Free Roux</h3>
    <p>The roux is the foundation of any gumbo, providing both flavor and thickness. To make a gluten-free roux, heat a mixture of oil and gluten-free flour (such as rice flour or almond flour) in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Stir continuously until the mixture turns a deep brown color, which can take anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes. Be patient—this step is crucial for developing the rich, nutty flavor that defines gumbo.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Holy Trinity</h3>
    <p>In Cajun and Creole cooking, the "holy trinity" refers to a combination of onions, bell peppers, and celery. These vegetables form the base of many dishes, including gumbo. Once your roux is ready, add the chopped vegetables to the pot and sauté until they are softened and fragrant. This step helps to build the layers of flavor in your gumbo.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Stock and Seasonings</h3>
    <p>Next, slowly pour in your gluten-free seafood or vegetable stock, stirring constantly to combine it with the roux and vegetables. Add bay leaves, thyme, cayenne pepper, and paprika to the pot, along with any other seasonings you prefer. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Incorporate the Seafood</h3>
    <p>Once the base of your gumbo is simmering, it’s time to add the seafood. Start with the heartier seafood, such as shrimp and crab, and let them cook for a few minutes before adding more delicate items like oysters or fish. Be careful not to overcook the seafood, as it can become tough and rubbery.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the seafood is cooked through and the gumbo has reached your desired consistency, remove the pot from the heat. Serve the gumbo over a bed of steamed rice, garnished with chopped green onions and a sprinkle of fresh parsley. Enjoy your gluten-free seafood gumbo with a side of crusty gluten-free bread or cornbread for a complete meal.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>Can I use other gluten-free flours for the roux?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a variety of gluten-free flours for the roux, such as rice flour, almond flour, or even a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Each flour will impart a slightly different flavor and texture, so feel free to experiment to find your favorite.</p>

        <h3>What if I don’t like okra?</h3>
        <p>If you’re not a fan of okra, you can omit it from the recipe or substitute it with another thickening agent, such as filé powder (ground sassafras leaves). Filé powder is traditionally added at the end of cooking and provides a unique flavor and texture to the gumbo.</p>

        <h3>Can I make gumbo ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Gumbo actually tastes better the next day, as the flavors have more time to develop. Simply store the gumbo in an airtight container in the refrigerator and reheat it gently on the stove before serving.</p>
