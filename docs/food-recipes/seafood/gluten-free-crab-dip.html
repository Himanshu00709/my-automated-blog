<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Crab Dip</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, it's time to whip up this delicious dip. Follow these simple steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Set your oven to 350°F (175°C) to ensure it's ready when you need it.</li>

    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the dip is hot and bubbly.</li>
