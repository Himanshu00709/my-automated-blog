    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create a delicious gluten-free salmon marinade:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Marinade:</strong> In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free tamari, olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, honey or maple syrup, Dijon mustard, and fresh dill. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Salmon:</strong> Place the salmon fillets in a shallow dish or a resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the salmon, ensuring that each fillet is well-coated. Cover the dish or seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for more intense flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Salmon:</strong> Preheat your grill, oven, or stovetop pan to medium-high heat. Remove the salmon from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off. Cook the salmon for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Once cooked, let the salmon rest for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with additional fresh dill or a squeeze of lemon juice if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Salmon Marinade</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular soy sauce instead of gluten-free tamari?</h3>
        <p>No, regular soy sauce contains gluten, which is derived from wheat. If you need a gluten-free option, stick to gluten-free tamari or coconut aminos.</p>

        <h3>2. How long can I marinate the salmon?</h3>
        <p>You can marinate the salmon for as little as 30 minutes or up to 2 hours. Marinating for too long can result in the salmon becoming overly soft due to the acidity in the lemon juice.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I use this marinade for other types of fish?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This marinade works well with other types of fish such as cod, halibut, or trout. Adjust the cooking time based on the thickness of the fish.</p>

        <h3>4. Is this marinade suitable for grilling?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this marinade is perfect for grilling. The olive oil in the marinade helps prevent the salmon from sticking to the grill.</p>

        <h3>5. Can I make this marinade ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the marinade up to 2 days in advance and store it in the refrigerator. Just give it a good stir before using it.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>A gluten-free salmon marinade is a fantastic way to enjoy a healthy and flavorful meal without compromising your dietary needs. By using simple, fresh ingredients, you can create a marinade that enhances the natural flavors of the salmon while keeping it gluten-free. Whether you're grilling, baking, or pan-searing, this marinade is versatile and easy to prepare. Give it a try and elevate your next salmon dish to a whole new level!</p>
