<h2>Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Prawns</h3>
<p>Start by cleaning the prawns thoroughly. Remove the shells and devein them if necessary. Pat them dry with a paper towel to ensure the coating sticks well.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Set Up Your Coating Station</h3>
<p>Prepare three separate bowls for the coating process. In the first bowl, place the gluten-free flour. In the second bowl, beat the eggs. In the third bowl, mix the shredded coconut with salt, black pepper, and paprika.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Coat the Prawns</h3>
<p>Dip each prawn first into the gluten-free flour, ensuring it's fully coated. Next, dip it into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off. Finally, roll the prawn in the coconut mixture, pressing gently to ensure the coconut adheres well.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Fry the Prawns</h3>
<p>Heat coconut oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the coated prawns into the pan. Fry them for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they turn golden brown and crispy. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan, as this can lower the oil temperature and result in soggy prawns.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once the prawns are cooked, transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil. Serve them hot with your favorite dipping sauce, such as sweet chili sauce or a tangy mango salsa.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Coconut Prawns</h2>

<p>Gluten-free coconut prawns are not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Prawns are an excellent source of protein, which is essential for muscle repair and growth. They are also low in calories and fat, making them a great option for those looking to maintain a healthy weight.</p>

<p>Coconut, on the other hand, is rich in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are known for their energy-boosting properties. MCTs are easily digested and can be quickly converted into energy, making them a great addition to your diet. Additionally, coconut contains antioxidants that can help protect your body from oxidative stress.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Coconut Prawns</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use frozen prawns for this recipe?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen prawns. Just make sure to thaw them completely and pat them dry before coating.</p>

    <h3>2. What can I use instead of coconut oil for frying?</h3>
    <p>You can use other healthy oils like avocado oil or olive oil. However, coconut oil adds a subtle coconut flavor that complements the dish.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I bake the prawns instead of frying them?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can bake the prawns at 200°C (400°F) for about 10-12 minutes, flipping them halfway through. This method reduces the oil content, making the dish even healthier.</p>

    <h3>4. Are gluten-free coconut prawns suitable for people with nut allergies?</h3>
    <p>If you're using almond flour, be cautious as it contains nuts. You can substitute it with rice flour or another nut-free gluten-free flour.</p>
</div>

<p>Gluten-free coconut prawns are a delightful dish that combines the best of both worlds—flavor and health. Whether you're following a gluten-free diet or simply looking for a new way to enjoy prawns, this recipe is a must-try. With its crispy coconut coating and succulent prawns, it's a dish that will satisfy your taste buds while keeping your dietary needs in check.
