    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Shrimp</h3>
    <p>Start by rinsing the shrimp under cold water and patting them dry with paper towels. This step ensures that the coating adheres properly to the shrimp. If the shrimp still have their tails on, you can leave them for presentation or remove them if preferred.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Set Up Your Breading Station</h3>
    <p>In three separate bowls, prepare your breading station. In the first bowl, mix the gluten-free flour, cornstarch, salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. In the second bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. In the third bowl, place the gluten-free breadcrumbs.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Coat the Shrimp</h3>
    <p>Dip each shrimp into the flour mixture, ensuring it’s fully coated. Shake off any excess flour. Next, dip the shrimp into the egg mixture, allowing any excess to drip off. Finally, coat the shrimp in the gluten-free breadcrumbs, pressing gently to ensure the breadcrumbs stick.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Heat the Oil</h3>
    <p>In a deep skillet or frying pan, heat the oil to 350°F (175°C). Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature, as maintaining the correct heat is crucial for achieving a crispy texture without burning the shrimp.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fry the Shrimp</h3>
    <p>Carefully place the breaded shrimp into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry the shrimp for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve the gluten-free fried shrimp immediately with your favorite dipping sauce, such as tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, or a gluten-free aioli. Pair with a side of gluten-free fries or a fresh salad for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fried Shrimp</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours such as chickpea flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Each flour may slightly alter the texture and flavor, so feel free to experiment to find your favorite.</p>

        <h3>Can I bake the shrimp instead of frying?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! For a healthier alternative, you can bake the shrimp at 400°F (200°C) for 10-12 minutes, flipping halfway through. Spray the shrimp with a light coating of oil to help them crisp up in the oven.</p>

        <h3>What dipping sauces are gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Many store-bought sauces are gluten-free, but always check the label to be sure. Alternatively, you can make your own gluten-free dipping sauces at home using ingredients like mayonnaise, ketchup, horseradish, and lemon juice.</p>

        <h3>Can I use frozen shrimp?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen shrimp. Just make sure to thaw them completely and pat them dry before breading to ensure the coating sticks properly.</p>
