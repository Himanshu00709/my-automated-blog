    <h1>Gluten-Free Salmon Patties with Canned Salmon</h1>

    <p>Salmon patties are a classic dish that many people love for their simplicity and delicious flavor. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, traditional recipes can be off-limits due to the use of breadcrumbs or flour. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can enjoy gluten-free salmon patties that are just as tasty and satisfying. In this blog post, we’ll explore how to make gluten-free salmon patties using canned salmon, a convenient and affordable ingredient that’s packed with nutrients.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Canned Salmon?</h2>

    <p>Canned salmon is an excellent choice for making salmon patties. It’s not only budget-friendly but also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and essential vitamins like vitamin D. Unlike fresh salmon, canned salmon is already cooked, making it a quick and easy option for busy weeknights. Additionally, canned salmon often includes the bones, which are soft and edible, providing an extra boost of calcium.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Salmon Patties</h2>

    <p>To make gluten-free salmon patties, you’ll need the following ingredients:</p>

        </tr>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Salmon</h3>
    <p>Start by draining the canned salmon and placing it in a large mixing bowl. If you prefer, you can remove the skin and bones, but they are edible and add extra nutrients. Use a fork to break the salmon into smaller pieces.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add the gluten-free breadcrumbs, egg, chopped green onions, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper to the bowl with the salmon. Mix everything together until well combined. The mixture should hold together when pressed, but if it’s too dry, you can add a little more lemon juice or a splash of water.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Form the Patties</h3>
    <p>Divide the mixture into equal portions and shape them into patties. You should get about 6-8 patties, depending on the size you prefer. Place the patties on a plate or baking sheet and let them rest for about 10 minutes. This helps them hold their shape better during cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Patties</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the patties to the skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and heated through. Be gentle when flipping the patties to prevent them from breaking apart.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the patties are cooked, transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil. Serve the salmon patties warm with your favorite sides, such as a fresh salad, steamed vegetables, or a gluten-free bun for a sandwich option.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh salmon instead of canned salmon?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh salmon if you prefer. Simply cook the salmon first, then flake it into small pieces before mixing it with the other ingredients. Keep in mind that fresh salmon may require additional seasoning to match the flavor of canned salmon.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free breadcrumbs, you can use almond flour, crushed gluten-free crackers, or even cooked quinoa as a substitute. These alternatives will help bind the patties together while keeping them gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>Can I bake the salmon patties instead of frying them?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To bake the salmon patties, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the patties on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and lightly brush them with olive oil. Bake for about 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until they are golden brown and cooked through.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftover salmon patties?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover salmon patties in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat them in a skillet over medium heat or in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until warmed through.</p>
