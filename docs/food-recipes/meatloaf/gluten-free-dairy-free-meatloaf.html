<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making your gluten-free dairy-free meatloaf:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your meatloaf cooks evenly.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, gluten-free breadcrumbs, almond milk, egg, chopped onion, minced garlic, tomato paste, gluten-free Worcestershire sauce, dried thyme, salt, and pepper. Mix everything together until well combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Shape the Meatloaf:</strong> Transfer the mixture to a loaf pan or shape it into a loaf on a baking sheet. If using a loaf pan, make sure to grease it lightly with a non-dairy cooking spray to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the meatloaf in the preheated oven and bake for about 1 hour, or until the internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C). You can check the temperature using a meat thermometer.</li>
    <li><strong>Rest and Serve:</strong> Once the meatloaf is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring a moist and flavorful meatloaf.</li>
</ol>
