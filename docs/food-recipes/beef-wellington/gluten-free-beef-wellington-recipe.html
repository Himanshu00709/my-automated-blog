    <h1>Gluten-Free Beef Wellington Recipe</h1>
    <p>Beef Wellington is a classic dish that combines tender beef, savory mushrooms, and a flaky pastry crust. Traditionally, this dish is made with puff pastry, which contains gluten. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets, many people are looking for ways to enjoy this luxurious meal without compromising their health. In this blog post, we’ll walk you through a step-by-step guide to creating a delicious gluten-free Beef Wellington that’s sure to impress your guests.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Beef Wellington?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Even if you don’t have a gluten intolerance, opting for a gluten-free version of Beef Wellington can be a healthier choice, as it often involves using whole, unprocessed ingredients. Additionally, gluten-free pastry can be just as flaky and delicious as traditional puff pastry when made correctly.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2>
    <p>Before diving into the recipe, let’s gather all the necessary ingredients. Here’s what you’ll need:</p>
    <table>

            <td>6 slices</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Egg</td>
            <td>1 (for egg wash)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Beef Tenderloin</h3>
    <p>Start by seasoning the beef tenderloin generously with salt and pepper. Heat a skillet over high heat and sear the beef on all sides until it’s browned. This step locks in the juices and adds a rich flavor to the meat. Once seared, remove the beef from the skillet and let it cool. Brush the cooled beef with Dijon mustard, which will add a tangy flavor that complements the richness of the meat.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Mushroom Duxelles</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add finely chopped cremini mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and thyme. Cook the mixture over medium heat until the mushrooms release their moisture and the mixture becomes a thick paste. This is known as duxelles, a classic component of Beef Wellington. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then set aside to cool.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Wellington</h3>
    <p>Lay out a sheet of gluten-free puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Arrange the prosciutto slices in a single layer on the pastry, slightly overlapping. Spread the cooled mushroom duxelles evenly over the prosciutto. Place the beef tenderloin in the center and carefully wrap the pastry around the beef, sealing the edges with a bit of water or egg wash. Trim any excess pastry and use it to decorate the top if desired.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Brush the entire pastry with an egg wash to give it a golden, glossy finish. Place the Beef Wellington on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the internal temperature of the beef reaches 125°F (52°C) for medium-rare. Let the Wellington rest for 10 minutes before slicing.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different cut of beef?</h3>
        <p>While beef tenderloin is the traditional choice for Beef Wellington due to its tenderness, you can use other cuts like sirloin or ribeye. Just keep in mind that these cuts may require different cooking times.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free puff pastry?</h3>
        <p>If you can’t find gluten-free puff pastry, you can use gluten-free pie crust or even make your own gluten-free pastry from scratch using a blend of gluten-free flours.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftover Beef Wellington can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until warmed through.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can assemble the Beef Wellington up to a day in advance and keep it refrigerated until ready to bake. Just make sure to let it come to room temperature before baking.</p>
