<h1>Beef Wellington Gluten-Free: A Culinary Masterpiece</h1>

<p>Beef Wellington is a classic dish that has graced the tables of fine dining establishments for decades. Traditionally, this dish consists of a tender beef fillet coated with pâté and duxelles, then wrapped in puff pastry and baked to perfection. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, the traditional recipe poses a challenge due to the use of wheat-based puff pastry. Fortunately, with a few adjustments, you can create a gluten-free Beef Wellington that is just as delicious and impressive as the original.</p>

<h2>The History of Beef Wellington</h2>

<h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

By opting for a gluten-free version of Beef Wellington, you can enjoy this classic dish without compromising your dietary needs.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Beef</h3>

<p>Start by seasoning the beef tenderloin generously with salt and pepper. Heat a skillet over high heat and sear the beef on all sides until it develops a rich, brown crust. This step is crucial for locking in the juices and enhancing the flavor. Once seared, remove the beef from the skillet and let it cool slightly. Brush the entire surface of the beef with Dijon mustard, which will add a tangy depth of flavor.</p>

<h3>2. Making the Duxelles</h3>

<p>In the same skillet, add finely chopped mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and thyme. Cook over medium heat until the mixture is dry and all the moisture has evaporated. This mixture, known as duxelles, will serve as a flavorful layer between the beef and the pastry. Allow the duxelles to cool completely before proceeding.</p>

<h3>3. Assembling the Wellington</h3>

<p>Lay out a sheet of gluten-free puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Arrange the slices of prosciutto in a single layer on top of the pastry, slightly overlapping each other. Spread the cooled duxelles evenly over the prosciutto. Place the seared beef in the center and carefully wrap the pastry around the beef, ensuring that it is fully enclosed. Trim any excess pastry and seal the edges with a bit of egg wash.</p>

<h3>4. Baking the Wellington</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Transfer the assembled Wellington to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the entire surface of the pastry with egg wash, which will give it a beautiful golden finish. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the internal temperature of the beef reaches 125°F (52°C) for medium-rare. Let the Wellington rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</p>

<h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>

<p>Beef Wellington is best served with a side of roasted vegetables or a fresh green salad. For a more indulgent experience, consider pairing it with a rich red wine sauce or a creamy mushroom sauce. The combination of flavors and textures will make this dish a show-stopping centerpiece for any meal.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make Beef Wellington ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare Beef Wellington up to a day in advance. Assemble the Wellington as directed, but do not bake it. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate. When ready to serve, remove the plastic wrap, brush with egg wash, and bake as directed.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free puff pastry?</h3>
    <p>If you cannot find gluten-free puff pastry, you can use a gluten-free pie crust or even a layer of thinly sliced gluten-free bread. However, the texture and flavor may differ slightly from the traditional version.</p>

    <h3>How do I know when the beef is cooked to my liking?</h3>
    <p>Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the beef. For medium-rare, aim for 125°F (52°C). For medium, aim for 135°F (57°C). Keep in mind that the beef will continue to cook slightly as it rests.</p>
