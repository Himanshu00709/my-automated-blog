    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Hollandaise Sauce</h2>

    <p>Making hollandaise sauce from scratch may seem intimidating, but with the right technique, it’s surprisingly straightforward. Follow these steps to create a smooth, velvety gluten-free hollandaise sauce:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Egg Yolks</h3>
    <p>In a heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks until they become pale and slightly thickened. This process helps to create a stable base for the sauce.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add Lemon Juice and Seasonings</h3>
    <p>Whisk in the lemon juice, Dijon mustard (if using), salt, and cayenne pepper. The lemon juice not only adds flavor but also helps to stabilize the emulsion.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Incorporate the Butter</h3>
    <p>Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method) and continue whisking. Slowly drizzle in the melted butter, whisking constantly to create a smooth, creamy emulsion. Be careful not to overheat the mixture, as it can cause the eggs to curdle.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Adjust Consistency and Taste</h3>
    <p>If the sauce is too thick, you can thin it out with a teaspoon of warm water. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Your gluten-free hollandaise sauce is now ready to serve!</p>
