    <h1>Gluten-Free Orange Sauce: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of gluten intolerance and celiac disease. Among the many gluten-free options available, gluten-free orange sauce stands out as a versatile and flavorful addition to any meal. Whether you're drizzling it over grilled chicken, using it as a dipping sauce, or incorporating it into a stir-fry, this sauce is a game-changer for those seeking a gluten-free lifestyle without compromising on taste.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Orange Sauce?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free orange sauce is a tangy, sweet, and slightly savory sauce made without any gluten-containing ingredients. Traditional orange sauces often use soy sauce, which contains wheat, but gluten-free versions substitute this with tamari or coconut aminos. The sauce typically combines fresh orange juice, garlic, ginger, and a touch of sweetness from honey or maple syrup, creating a balanced flavor profile that complements a variety of dishes.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Orange Sauce?</h2>
    <p>Choosing gluten-free orange sauce is not just about avoiding gluten; it's about embracing a healthier lifestyle. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe digestive issues, fatigue, and other health problems. Even for those without gluten intolerance, opting for gluten-free options can reduce inflammation and improve overall gut health. Additionally, gluten-free orange sauce is often made with natural, whole-food ingredients, making it a healthier choice compared to many store-bought sauces that contain artificial additives and preservatives.</p>
