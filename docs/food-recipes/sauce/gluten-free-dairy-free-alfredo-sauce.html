<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Alfredo Sauce</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free and dairy-free Alfredo sauce is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a creamy, flavorful sauce that’s perfect for pasta, vegetables, or as a dip.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegan butter or olive oil</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 cup unsweetened almond milk or coconut milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup raw cashews (soaked and blended) or cashew cream</li>
    <li>1/4 cup nutritional yeast</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch or arrowroot powder</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Optional: Fresh parsley or basil for garnish</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a medium saucepan, melt the vegan butter or heat the olive oil over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Add the minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
    <li>In a blender, combine the almond milk, soaked cashews, nutritional yeast, and cornstarch. Blend until smooth.</li>
    <li>Pour the blended mixture into the saucepan with the garlic. Stir continuously over medium heat until the sauce thickens, about 5-7 minutes.</li>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Alfredo Sauce</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use other nuts instead of cashews?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use other nuts like almonds or macadamia nuts. However, cashews are preferred because they blend into a smooth, creamy texture that closely resembles traditional Alfredo sauce.</p>

    <h3>2. Is nutritional yeast necessary?</h3>

    <h3>3. Can I make this sauce ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make the sauce ahead of time and store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat it on the stove or in the microwave, adding a little almond milk if needed to thin it out.</p>

    <h3>4. What can I serve with gluten-free dairy-free Alfredo sauce?</h3>
