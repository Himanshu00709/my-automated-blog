<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Meatball Sauce</h2>

<p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the process of making a delicious gluten-free meatball sauce.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Ingredients</h3>

<p>Start by gathering all your ingredients. Ensure that all your spices and thickening agents are certified gluten-free. Chop your garlic, onions, and fresh herbs to have them ready for cooking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Sauté the Aromatics</h3>

<p>Heat a large saucepan over medium heat and add a tablespoon of olive oil. Sauté the chopped onions and garlic until they become translucent and fragrant. This step is crucial for building the base flavor of your sauce.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add the Tomato Base</h3>

<p>Once the aromatics are ready, add your tomato base—whether it’s crushed tomatoes, tomato puree, or tomato paste. Stir well to combine with the onions and garlic. Allow the mixture to simmer for a few minutes to let the flavors meld.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Incorporate the Thickening Agent</h3>

<p>If your sauce needs thickening, mix your chosen gluten-free thickening agent (like cornstarch or arrowroot powder) with a small amount of cold water to create a slurry. Gradually add this to the sauce, stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Allow the sauce to simmer until it reaches your desired consistency.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Season to Taste</h3>

<p>Add your seasonings—salt, pepper, fresh herbs, and any other spices you prefer. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning as needed. Remember, it’s easier to add more seasoning later than to fix an overly seasoned sauce.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Simmer and Serve</h3>

<p>Let the sauce simmer on low heat for at least 20-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to deepen. Once ready, pour the sauce over your cooked meatballs and serve immediately. Enjoy your gluten-free meatball dish!</p>
