    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by dicing the onions, bell peppers, and garlic. Measure out your spices and have your ground meat ready. This prep work ensures a smooth cooking process.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions and bell peppers, cooking until they soften and become fragrant. Stir in the garlic and cook for an additional minute.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Brown the Meat</h3>
    <p>Add the ground meat to the pot and cook until browned. Break it up into small pieces as it cooks to ensure even distribution throughout the chili.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Simmer the Chili</h3>
    <p>Pour in the crushed tomatoes and broth, stirring to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for at least 30 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld together beautifully.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
