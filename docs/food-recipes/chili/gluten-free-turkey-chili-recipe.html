<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
<p>Start by gathering all your ingredients and chopping the vegetables. Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and chop the bell peppers. Drain and rinse the beans to remove excess sodium.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Cook the Turkey</h3>
<p>Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the ground turkey and cook until it’s no longer pink, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. This should take about 5-7 minutes.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
<p>Add the diced onion, minced garlic, and bell peppers to the pot with the turkey. Sauté for about 5 minutes until the vegetables are softened and fragrant.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add the Remaining Ingredients</h3>
<p>Stir in the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, kidney beans, black beans, and chicken broth. Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine all the ingredients.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Simmer the Chili</h3>
<p>Bring the chili to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer uncovered for about 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally. This allows the flavors to meld together and the chili to thicken.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once the chili is ready, ladle it into bowls and serve with your favorite toppings, such as shredded cheese, avocado, sour cream, or fresh cilantro. Enjoy your gluten-free turkey chili with a side of cornbread or tortilla chips for a complete meal.</p>
