    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by gathering all your ingredients and preparing them as needed. Dice the onion and bell pepper, mince the garlic, and rinse and drain the beans. Having everything ready before you start cooking will make the process smoother.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Turkey</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the ground turkey and cook until it’s no longer pink, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. This should take about 5-7 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Once the turkey is cooked, add the diced onion, minced garlic, and diced bell pepper to the pot. Cook for another 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Incorporate the Remaining Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, kidney beans, black beans, and chicken broth to the pot. Stir in the chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix everything well to combine.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Simmer the Chili</h3>
    <p>Bring the chili to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for at least 30 minutes. The longer it simmers, the more the flavors will meld together. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the chili is done, ladle it into bowls and serve with your favorite toppings, such as shredded cheese, avocado, or a dollop of sour cream. Enjoy your gluten-free turkey chili with a side of cornbread or a fresh salad for a complete meal.</p>
