    <h1>Gluten, Dairy, and Egg-Free Breakfast Recipes</h1>
    <p>Starting your day with a nutritious and delicious breakfast is essential, especially if you have dietary restrictions. Whether you're avoiding gluten, dairy, or eggs due to allergies, intolerances, or personal preferences, there are plenty of options to keep your mornings exciting and healthy.

Dairy can be problematic for individuals with lactose intolerance or a milk allergy, while eggs are a common allergen, especially in children. By choosing breakfast recipes that exclude these ingredients, you can enjoy a meal that is both safe and satisfying.</p>
