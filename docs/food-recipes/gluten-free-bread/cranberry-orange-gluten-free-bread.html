    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making Cranberry Orange Gluten-Free Bread is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a loaf that’s moist, flavorful, and perfectly gluten-free:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a loaf pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk these ingredients together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, honey (or maple syrup), orange zest, orange juice, and melted coconut oil. Make sure the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense loaf. Fold in the dried cranberries gently.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve with your favorite spread or enjoy it as is!</p>
