    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, mix the almond milk, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup, and melted coconut oil. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a soft dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour.</p>

    <h3>2. Roll Out the Dough</h3>

    <p>Place the dough on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Roll it out into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. If the dough is too sticky, you can place a piece of parchment paper on top and roll it out that way.</p>

    <h3>3. Add the Cinnamon Filling</h3>

    <p>In a small bowl, mix the coconut sugar and ground cinnamon. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the rolled-out dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Gently press the cinnamon sugar into the dough to ensure it sticks.</p>

    <h3>4. Roll and Cut</h3>

    <p>Starting from one of the longer sides, carefully roll the dough into a tight log. Use a sharp knife or a piece of dental floss to cut the log into 8-10 equal pieces. Place the rolls in a greased baking dish, leaving a little space between each one.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake</h3>

    <p>Bake the cinnamon rolls in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. While the rolls are baking, you can prepare the frosting.</p>

    <h3>6. Make the Frosting</h3>

    <p>In a small bowl, mix the dairy-free cream cheese with powdered sugar (if using) until smooth. You can adjust the sweetness to your liking. Once the cinnamon rolls are out of the oven, let them cool for a few minutes before spreading the frosting on top.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. Just make sure it’s a 1:1 substitute for all-purpose flour. Almond flour or oat flour can also work, but the texture may vary.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cinnamon rolls ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the dough and cut the rolls the night before. Cover them tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate. In the morning, simply bake them as directed.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of coconut sugar?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have coconut sugar, you can use brown sugar or any other granulated sugar. The flavor will be slightly different, but it will still be delicious.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze these cinnamon rolls?</h3>
        <p>Yes, these cinnamon rolls freeze well. Once baked and cooled, wrap them individually in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe bag. To reheat, simply microwave for 30-60 seconds or bake in the oven until warm.</p>
