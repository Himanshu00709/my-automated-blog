    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Oat Cookies</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free dairy-free oat cookies is a straightforward process that requires minimal effort. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating these delicious treats:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of gluten-free oats, 1 cup of almond flour, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix 1/2 cup of melted coconut oil, 1/4 cup of maple syrup, and 1 tablespoon of flaxseed meal mixed with 3 tablespoons of water (this acts as an egg substitute).</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Ingredients:</strong> Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until well combined. Fold in 1/2 cup of dairy-free dark chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Form Cookies:</strong> Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of the dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Flatten each cookie slightly with the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
