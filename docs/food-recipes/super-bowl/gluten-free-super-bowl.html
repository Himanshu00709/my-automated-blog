    <h1>Gluten-Free Super Bowl: A Game Day Guide for Everyone</h1>
    <p>The Super Bowl is one of the most anticipated events of the year, bringing friends and family together for a day of football, fun, and, of course, food. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, navigating the traditional spread of wings, nachos, and pizza can be a challenge. But fear not!

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free for the Super Bowl?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or wheat allergies. Even if you don’t have a gluten-related condition, many people choose to go gluten-free for its potential health benefits, such as improved digestion and reduced inflammation. The Super Bowl is the perfect opportunity to showcase how delicious and inclusive gluten-free eating can be. Plus, with so many gluten-free options available today, you won’t have to sacrifice flavor or tradition.</p>

    <h3>Appetizers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Wings:</strong> Use a gluten-free flour blend for coating and ensure your sauce is gluten-free. Buffalo, BBQ, and honey garlic are all great options.</li>
        <li><strong>Nachos:</strong> Use gluten-free tortilla chips and top with cheese, guacamole, salsa, and sour cream. Add ground beef or chicken for extra protein.</li>
