<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the wings:</strong> Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels. This helps the coating stick better and ensures crispiness.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix well.</li>
    <li><strong>Coat the wings:</strong> Toss the chicken wings in the flour mixture until they are evenly coated. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
    <li><strong>Arrange on the baking sheet:</strong> Place the coated wings on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Drizzle with olive oil or avocado oil.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the wings in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, flipping halfway through, until they are golden brown and crispy.</li>
    <li><strong>Optional sauce:</strong> If you prefer saucy wings, toss the baked wings in gluten-free hot sauce before serving.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the wings hot with your favorite gluten-free dipping sauce and enjoy!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Wings</h2>

<p>Here are some additional tips to ensure your gluten-free wings turn out perfectly every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Choose the right flour:</strong> Almond flour and rice flour are excellent gluten-free alternatives that provide a crispy coating. You can also use a gluten-free flour blend.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t overcrowd the baking sheet:</strong> Make sure the wings are arranged in a single layer with some space between them. This allows for even cooking and crispiness.</li>
    <li><strong>Use a wire rack:</strong> Placing the wings on a wire rack set over the baking sheet can help air circulate around the wings, making them even crispier.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with seasonings:</strong> Feel free to customize the seasoning blend to your taste. Add cayenne pepper for extra heat or smoked paprika for a deeper flavor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Wings</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different type of flour for this recipe?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour you prefer. Almond flour, rice flour, and gluten-free all-purpose flour blends all work well. Each flour will give a slightly different texture, so feel free to experiment.</p>

    <h3>2. Are all hot sauces gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Not all hot sauces are gluten-free, so it’s important to check the label. Many popular brands, like Frank’s RedHot, are gluten-free, but always verify to be safe.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I fry these wings instead of baking them?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can fry the wings if you prefer. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 375°F (190°C) and fry the wings until golden brown and crispy, about 8-10 minutes. Make sure the oil is hot enough to prevent the wings from absorbing too much oil.</p>

    <h3>4. How do I store leftover gluten-free wings?</h3>
    <p>Store leftover wings in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat them in the oven or air fryer to maintain their crispiness.</p>
