    <h1>Gluten-Free Chicken Cordon Bleu Recipe</h1>
    <p>Chicken Cordon Bleu is a classic dish that combines tender chicken, savory ham, and melted cheese, all wrapped in a crispy coating.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Chicken Breasts</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375째F (190째C). Lay the chicken breasts flat on a cutting board and carefully slice them horizontally, creating a pocket for the filling. Be careful not to cut all the way through. Season the inside of each pocket with salt and pepper.</p>

    <h3>2. Add the Filling</h3>
    <p>Spread a thin layer of Dijon mustard inside each chicken pocket. Place a slice of ham and a slice of Swiss cheese inside each pocket. Fold the chicken breast over the filling, securing it with toothpicks if necessary.</p>

    <h3>3. Coat the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes. In the first dish, place the gluten-free flour. In the second dish, beat the eggs. In the third dish, place the gluten-free breadcrumbs. Dredge each chicken breast in the flour, then dip it in the beaten eggs, and finally coat it with the breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere.</p>

    <h3>4. Cook the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken breasts for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C).</p>

    <h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving. Remove the toothpicks and serve the Chicken Cordon Bleu with your favorite gluten-free sides, such as steamed vegetables or a fresh salad.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute Swiss cheese with other types of cheese such as mozzarella, cheddar, or provolone. Just make sure the cheese melts well to achieve that gooey, delicious filling.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have gluten-free breadcrumbs, you can use crushed gluten-free crackers, almond flour, or even gluten-free cornflakes as a substitute. These alternatives will still give you a crispy coating.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the chicken breasts up to the breading step and store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before cooking. This makes it a great option for meal prep or entertaining.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for freezing?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cooked Chicken Cordon Bleu. Allow it to cool completely, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil. It can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and then bake it in the oven until heated through.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
