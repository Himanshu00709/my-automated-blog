<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Chicken</h3>

<p>Start by placing the chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper. Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, gently pound the chicken to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch. This ensures even cooking and tender chicken.</p>

<h3>2. Coat the Chicken</h3>

<p>In a shallow dish, combine the gluten-free flour, salt, and black pepper. Dredge each chicken breast in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess. This step helps create a light crust and thickens the sauce later.</p>

<h3>3. Cook the Chicken</h3>

<p>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</p>

<h3>4. Make the Sauce</h3>

<p>In the same skillet, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter. Once the butter has melted, add the minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Pour in the chicken broth and lemon juice, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Stir in the capers and let the sauce simmer for 2-3 minutes until slightly reduced.</p>

<h3>5. Combine and Serve</h3>

<p>Return the chicken to the skillet, spooning the sauce over the top. Let it simmer for another 2 minutes to heat through. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve immediately. This dish pairs wonderfully with gluten-free pasta, steamed vegetables, or a fresh salad.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute gluten-free flour with almond flour, coconut flour, or even cornstarch. Each will give a slightly different texture, so choose based on your preference.</p>

    <h3>Is this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>This recipe includes butter, which contains dairy. To make it dairy-free, you can substitute the butter with a plant-based alternative like olive oil or vegan butter.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in a skillet or microwave, adding a splash of chicken broth if needed to keep the chicken moist.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze this dish?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze cooked chicken piccata. Place it in a freezer-safe container and store for up to 2 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before reheating.</p>
