    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Start by seasoning the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Then, coat each piece evenly with gluten-free flour. This step is crucial as it helps to create a crispy outer layer when the chicken is cooked.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Heat the coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken breasts and cook for about 5-6 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Coconut Sauce</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the minced garlic, grated ginger, and red chili flakes. Sauté for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Then, pour in the coconut milk and lime juice, stirring to combine. Allow the sauce to simmer for 5-7 minutes, or until it thickens slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine and Serve</h3>
    <p>Return the cooked chicken to the skillet, coating it evenly with the coconut sauce. Let it simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving. This dish pairs wonderfully with steamed rice or a fresh green salad.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Coconut Chicken</h2>

    <p>This gluten-free coconut chicken recipe is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits.
