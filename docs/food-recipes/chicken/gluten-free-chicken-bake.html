<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C). This ensures that your chicken bake will cook evenly and achieve a golden-brown crust.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
<p>Season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. This step is crucial for infusing the chicken with flavor. Make sure to coat both sides of the chicken evenly.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Coat the Chicken</h3>
<p>In a shallow dish, mix the gluten-free breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan cheese. Dredge each chicken breast in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to ensure the coating adheres well.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Arrange in a Baking Dish</h3>
<p>Place the coated chicken breasts in a greased baking dish. Drizzle olive oil over the top to help the chicken achieve a crispy texture during baking.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake the Chicken</h3>
<p>Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C). The breadcrumb coating should be golden brown and crispy.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Garnish and Serve</h3>
