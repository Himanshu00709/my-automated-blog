    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure that your casserole bakes evenly and the cheese melts to perfection.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Cut the chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces. Season them with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. In a large bowl, mix the gluten-free breadcrumbs with the grated Parmesan cheese. Coat the chicken pieces evenly with the breadcrumb mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the coated chicken pieces and cook until they are golden brown on all sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. The chicken doesn’t need to be fully cooked at this stage, as it will finish cooking in the oven.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange the cooked chicken pieces on top of the sauce. Pour the remaining marinara sauce over the chicken, ensuring that all pieces are well-covered. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the top.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free chicken parmesan casserole pairs wonderfully with a side of gluten-free pasta, a fresh green salad, or steamed vegetables. For an extra touch of flavor, garnish with fresh basil or parsley before serving.</p>
