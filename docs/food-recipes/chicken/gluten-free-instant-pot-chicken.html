    <h2>Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that we have all the ingredients ready, let's move on to the cooking process. Follow these simple steps to make your gluten-free Instant Pot chicken:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Instant Pot</h3>

    <p>Start by setting your Instant Pot to the "Sauté" function. Add the olive oil and allow it to heat up for a minute or two. This will help to sear the chicken and lock in the flavors.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Sear the Chicken</h3>

    <p>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken breasts to the Instant Pot. Sear each side for about 2-3 minutes until they develop a golden-brown crust. Remove the chicken and set it aside on a plate.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Sauté the Aromatics</h3>

    <p>In the same Instant Pot, add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté for about 2-3 minutes until the onions become translucent and the garlic is fragrant. This will create a flavorful base for your dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Deglaze the Pot</h3>

    <p>Pour in the gluten-free chicken broth and gluten-free soy sauce. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. This step is crucial as it adds depth of flavor to your dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Chicken Back to the Pot</h3>

    <p>Place the seared chicken breasts back into the Instant Pot. Sprinkle the dried thyme and rosemary over the chicken. These herbs will infuse the chicken with a delightful aroma and taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Pressure Cook</h3>

    <p>Secure the lid on the Instant Pot and set the valve to the "Sealing" position. Select the "Manual" or "Pressure Cook" function and set the timer for 10 minutes. Once the cooking time is complete, allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes, then do a quick release for any remaining pressure.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Serve and Garnish</h3>

    <p>Carefully remove the chicken from the Instant Pot and place it on a serving platter. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a burst of color and freshness. Serve your gluten-free Instant Pot chicken with your favorite sides, such as steamed vegetables, quinoa, or a fresh salad.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can absolutely use chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. Chicken thighs are more forgiving and tend to stay juicier during cooking. Adjust the cooking time to 12 minutes if using thighs.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for meal prep?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This gluten-free Instant Pot chicken is perfect for meal prep. You can store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or freeze it for up to 3 months. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop when ready to eat.</p>

        <h3>Can I add vegetables to this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add vegetables like carrots, potatoes, or green beans to the Instant Pot along with the chicken. Just make sure to cut them into uniform pieces so they cook evenly. Add an extra 2-3 minutes to the cooking time if including vegetables.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free soy sauce?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have gluten-free soy sauce, you can use tamari or coconut aminos as a substitute. Both are gluten-free and will provide a similar umami flavor to your dish.</p>
