    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Chicken Wings</h3>
    <p>Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. This step is crucial for achieving crispy wings. In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Toss the chicken wings in the flour mixture until they are evenly coated.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Arrange the Wings on the Baking Sheet</h3>
    <p>Place the coated chicken wings on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer, making sure they are not touching each other. Drizzle the wings with olive oil to help them crisp up in the oven.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Wings</h3>
    <p>Bake the wings in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, flipping them halfway through the cooking time. The wings should be golden brown and crispy when done. If you prefer extra crispy wings, you can broil them for an additional 2-3 minutes at the end of the cooking time.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Optional Sauce Toss</h3>
    <p>If you like your wings saucy, toss the baked wings in gluten-free hot sauce immediately after they come out of the oven. Serve the wings with your favorite gluten-free dipping sauce and enjoy!</p>
