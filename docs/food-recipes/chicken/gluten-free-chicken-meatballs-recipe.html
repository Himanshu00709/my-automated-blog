    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by gathering all your ingredients. Ensure that your breadcrumbs are certified gluten-free, as some brands may contain hidden gluten. If you’re unsure, you can make your own gluten-free breadcrumbs by toasting gluten-free bread and processing it in a food processor.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground chicken, gluten-free breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, minced garlic, chopped parsley, egg, salt, and black pepper. Use your hands to mix the ingredients thoroughly until everything is well combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the meatballs tough.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Form the Meatballs</h3>
    <p>Once the mixture is ready, use a tablespoon or a small ice cream scoop to portion out the meat mixture. Roll each portion into a ball, about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter. Place the formed meatballs on a plate or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Meatballs</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the meatballs in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Cook the meatballs for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (74°C) when checked with a meat thermometer.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the meatballs are cooked, remove them from the skillet and let them rest for a few minutes. Serve them with your favorite gluten-free pasta, marinara sauce, or as a standalone appetizer with a dipping sauce. They also pair wonderfully with a fresh salad or steamed vegetables.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Chicken Meatballs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh garlic and parsley will give your meatballs a more vibrant flavor compared to dried alternatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the meat can result in dense and tough meatballs. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Gluten:</strong> Always double-check that your breadcrumbs and any other added ingredients are certified gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add other herbs and spices, such as oregano, basil, or red pepper flakes, to customize the flavor to your liking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I bake these meatballs instead of frying them?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake the meatballs if you prefer a healthier cooking method. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and place the meatballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until they are cooked through and golden brown.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze these meatballs?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! These gluten-free chicken meatballs freeze well. After cooking, let them cool completely, then place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze until solid. Once frozen, transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container. They can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply bake them in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until heated through.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free breadcrumbs on hand, you can use almond flour, crushed gluten-free crackers, or even rolled oats (ensure they are certified gluten-free) as a substitute. These alternatives will help bind the meatballs while keeping them gluten-free.</p>
