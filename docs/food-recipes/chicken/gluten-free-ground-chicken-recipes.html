<h2>Tips for Cooking with Ground Chicken</h2>

<p>When working with ground chicken, it’s important to keep a few tips in mind to ensure your dishes turn out flavorful and moist:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Season Well:</strong> Ground chicken can be bland on its own, so be generous with seasonings like garlic, onion, herbs, and spices.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overcook:</strong> Chicken can dry out quickly, so cook it just until it’s no longer pink in the center.</li>
    <li><strong>Use a Non-Stick Pan:</strong> Ground chicken tends to stick to the pan, so using a non-stick skillet or adding a bit of oil can help prevent this.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Moisture:</strong> Ingredients like diced vegetables, sauces, or cheese can help keep ground chicken dishes moist and flavorful.</li>
</ul>
