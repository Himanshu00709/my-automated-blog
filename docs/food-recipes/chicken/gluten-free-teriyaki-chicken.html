    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Start by cutting the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Gluten-Free Teriyaki Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, whisk together the gluten-free soy sauce, honey (or maple syrup), rice vinegar, minced garlic, and grated ginger. In a separate small bowl, mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water to create a slurry. Add the slurry to the sauce mixture and whisk until well combined.</p>

    <h3>3. Combine and Simmer</h3>
    <p>Return the cooked chicken to the skillet. Pour the teriyaki sauce over the chicken and stir to coat evenly. Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the sauce simmer for about 5-10 minutes, or until it thickens and the chicken is fully cooked through.</p>

    <h3>4. Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the chicken is cooked and the sauce has thickened, remove the skillet from the heat. Garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions. Serve the gluten-free teriyaki chicken over steamed rice or with a side of steamed vegetables for a complete meal.</p>
