<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Chicken and Vegetables</h3>

<p>Start by slicing the chicken breast into thin strips. This ensures that the chicken cooks evenly and absorbs the flavors of the seasoning. Next, slice the bell peppers and onion into thin strips. The combination of colorful bell peppers not only adds visual appeal but also provides a variety of nutrients.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Seasoning Mix</h3>

<p>In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, cumin, paprika, minced garlic, lime juice, salt, and pepper. Mix well to create a flavorful marinade. This homemade seasoning mix is gluten-free and free from any hidden additives that might be present in store-bought mixes.</p>

<h3>3. Marinate the Chicken</h3>

<p>Place the chicken strips in a large bowl and pour the seasoning mix over them. Toss the chicken to ensure it’s evenly coated. Let it marinate for at least 15-20 minutes. For even more flavor, you can marinate the chicken for up to an hour in the refrigerator.</p>

<h3>4. Cook the Fajitas</h3>

<p>Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the marinated chicken strips. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and slightly browned. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.</p>

<p>In the same pan, add the sliced bell peppers and onions. Cook for 5-7 minutes until they are tender and slightly caramelized. Return the chicken to the pan and toss everything together to combine.</p>

<h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Warm the gluten-free tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave. Serve the chicken and vegetable mixture on the tortillas, and top with your favorite toppings such as avocado, salsa, sour cream, or fresh cilantro. Fold the tortillas and enjoy your gluten-free chicken fajitas!</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Chicken Fajitas</h2>

<p>Gluten-free chicken fajitas are not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Chicken is an excellent source of lean protein, which is essential for muscle repair and growth. Bell peppers are rich in vitamins A and C, which support immune health and skin health. Onions provide antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. By using gluten-free tortillas, you can enjoy this meal without worrying about gluten-related issues.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chicken Fajitas</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Are all tortillas gluten-free?</h3>

However, there are many gluten-free options available, such as tortillas made from corn, almond flour, or cassava flour. Always check the label to ensure they are certified gluten-free.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I use a different protein instead of chicken?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute chicken with beef, shrimp, or even tofu for a vegetarian option. The cooking time may vary depending on the protein you choose.</p>

    <h3>3. How can I make this dish spicier?</h3>
    <p>If you prefer a spicier flavor, you can add a pinch of cayenne pepper or a diced jalapeño to the seasoning mix. Adjust the amount according to your heat preference.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I prepare the fajitas in advance?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can marinate the chicken and slice the vegetables ahead of time. Store them in the refrigerator until you’re ready to cook. This makes it a great option for meal prep or quick weeknight dinners.</p>
