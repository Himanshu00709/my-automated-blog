<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Chicken Breasts</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lay the chicken breasts flat on a cutting board and carefully slice a pocket into the side of each breast. Be careful not to cut all the way through. Season the inside of the pocket with salt and pepper.</p>

<h3>2. Stuff the Chicken</h3>

<p>Place a slice of ham and a slice of Swiss cheese inside each chicken breast pocket. Secure the opening with toothpicks to prevent the filling from leaking out during cooking.</p>

<h3>3. Coat the Chicken</h3>

<p>Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes. In the first dish, place the gluten-free flour. In the second dish, beat the eggs. In the third dish, place the gluten-free breadcrumbs. Dredge each stuffed chicken breast in the flour, then dip it into the beaten eggs, and finally coat it with the breadcrumbs, pressing gently to ensure the breadcrumbs adhere.</p>

<h3>4. Cook the Chicken</h3>

<p>Heat the olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken breasts and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).</p>

<h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving. Remove the toothpicks and serve the Chicken Cordon Bleu with your favorite side dishes, such as steamed vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh salad.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use high-quality ingredients:</strong> Since this dish has relatively few ingredients, it’s important to use high-quality ham and cheese for the best flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t skip the toothpicks:</strong> Securing the chicken with toothpicks ensures that the filling stays inside during cooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for gluten-free labels:</strong> Always double-check that your breadcrumbs and flour are certified gluten-free to avoid any cross-contamination.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>

    <p>Yes, you can prepare the stuffed chicken breasts ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before cooking. Just make sure to coat them with breadcrumbs right before cooking to maintain the crispiness.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze Chicken Cordon Bleu?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the uncooked, breaded chicken breasts for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to cook, simply thaw them in the refrigerator overnight and bake as directed.</p>
