    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Start by preparing the chicken breasts. Place them between two sheets of plastic wrap and gently pound them to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch. This ensures that the chicken cooks evenly. Season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Coat the Chicken with Gluten-Free Flour</h3>
    <p>In a shallow dish, spread the gluten-free flour. Dredge each chicken breast in the flour, shaking off any excess. This step helps to create a light coating that will brown nicely when cooked.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter has melted and the oil is hot, add the chicken breasts. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Sauté the Mushrooms and Shallots</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the remaining tablespoon of butter. Once melted, add the sliced mushrooms and minced shallots. Sauté for about 5-7 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender and the shallots are translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Deglaze the Pan with Marsala Wine</h3>
    <p>Pour the Marsala wine into the skillet, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Allow the wine to simmer and reduce by half, which should take about 5 minutes. This step is crucial for developing the deep, rich flavor of the sauce.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Add Chicken Broth and Cream</h3>
    <p>Stir in the chicken broth and heavy cream (if using). Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and let it cook for another 3-4 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Return the Chicken to the Skillet</h3>
    <p>Place the cooked chicken breasts back into the skillet, spooning the sauce over them. Let the chicken simmer in the sauce for a couple of minutes to heat through. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley before serving.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free Chicken Marsala pairs beautifully with a variety of side dishes. Consider serving it over gluten-free pasta, mashed cauliflower, or a bed of steamed vegetables. A simple green salad or roasted asparagus also makes a great accompaniment. Don’t forget a glass of Marsala wine to complete the meal!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour that you prefer. Almond flour, rice flour, and coconut flour are all great options. Just keep in mind that different flours may slightly alter the texture and flavor of the dish.</p>

        <h3>Is Marsala wine gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Most Marsala wines are naturally gluten-free, but it’s always a good idea to check the label to ensure that no gluten-containing ingredients have been added during the production process.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like olive oil or coconut oil, and omit the heavy cream or replace it with a dairy-free creamer.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave, adding a splash of chicken broth if the sauce has thickened too much.</p>
