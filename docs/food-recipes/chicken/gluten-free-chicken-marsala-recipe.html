<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Chicken</h3>
<p>Start by preparing the chicken breasts. If they are thick, you can butterfly them or pound them to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch. This ensures even cooking. Season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.</p>

<h3>2. Coat the Chicken</h3>
<p>Place the gluten-free flour in a shallow dish. Dredge each chicken breast in the flour, shaking off any excess. The flour will help create a light crust and thicken the sauce later.</p>

<h3>3. Cook the Chicken</h3>
<p>Heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter has melted and the oil is hot, add the chicken breasts. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside on a plate.</p>

<h3>4. Sauté the Mushrooms and Shallots</h3>
<p>In the same skillet, add the remaining tablespoon of butter. Once melted, add the sliced mushrooms and shallots. Sauté for about 5-7 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender and the shallots are translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning.</p>

<h3>5. Deglaze the Pan</h3>
<p>Pour the Marsala wine into the skillet, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. This step is crucial for developing the flavor of the sauce. Allow the wine to simmer and reduce by half, which should take about 5 minutes.</p>

<h3>6. Add the Broth and Cream</h3>
<p>Stir in the chicken broth and heavy cream, and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for another 5 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.</p>

<h3>7. Return the Chicken to the Skillet</h3>
<p>Place the cooked chicken breasts back into the skillet, spooning some of the sauce over the top. Let the chicken simmer in the sauce for an additional 2-3 minutes to heat through.</p>

<h3>8. Garnish and Serve</h3>
<p>Remove the skillet from the heat and sprinkle the dish with freshly chopped parsley. Serve the gluten-free Chicken Marsala over your choice of gluten-free pasta, mashed potatoes, or steamed vegetables.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free baking mix. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly depending on the flour you choose.</p>

    <h3>Is Marsala wine gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Most Marsala wines are naturally gluten-free, but it’s always a good idea to check the label or contact the manufacturer to ensure there are no added ingredients that contain gluten.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this dish dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like olive oil or coconut oil, and replace the heavy cream with a dairy-free cream such as coconut cream or almond milk. The flavor will be slightly different, but still delicious.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave, adding a splash of chicken broth if the sauce has thickened too much.</p>
