<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all the ingredients ready, let’s walk through the process of making these delicious gluten-free chicken meatballs.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Mixture</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground chicken, gluten-free breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, minced garlic, chopped parsley, egg, salt, and black pepper. If you like a bit of heat, add the optional red pepper flakes. Mix everything thoroughly until well combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the meatballs dense.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Shape the Meatballs</h3>
<p>Using your hands or a small scoop, shape the mixture into evenly sized meatballs. Aim for about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter. This size ensures that the meatballs cook evenly and are easy to handle.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cook the Meatballs</h3>
<p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the meatballs in the skillet, making sure not to overcrowd them. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. You can also bake them in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 20-25 minutes if you prefer a healthier cooking method.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once the meatballs are cooked, remove them from the skillet and let them rest for a few minutes. Serve them with your favorite gluten-free pasta, zucchini noodles, or a fresh salad. Garnish with additional parsley or Parmesan cheese for an extra touch of flavor.</p>
