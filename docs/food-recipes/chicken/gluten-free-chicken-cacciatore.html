    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to make your gluten-free Chicken Cacciatore:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong> Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper. In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes per side. Remove the chicken and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Vegetables:</strong> In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add the minced garlic and sliced bell peppers, and cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Tomatoes and Herbs:</strong> Stir in the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and herbs. Cook for a few minutes until the tomatoes start to break down and release their juices.</li>
        <li><strong>Deglaze the Pan:</strong> If using red wine, pour it into the skillet and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Allow the wine to reduce slightly, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer the Sauce:</strong> Add the chicken broth and bring the mixture to a simmer. Return the chicken thighs to the skillet, nestling them into the sauce. Cover and let simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the Chicken Cacciatore hot, garnished with fresh herbs if desired. It pairs well with gluten-free pasta, rice, or a side of roasted vegetables.</li>
    </ol>
