    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong> Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Dredge them in gluten-free flour, shaking off any excess.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong> Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 5-6 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
