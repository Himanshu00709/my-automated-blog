<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Chicken Wings</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). While the oven is heating, pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels. This step is crucial for achieving crispy wings. In a large bowl, mix the gluten-free flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Toss the chicken wings in the flour mixture until they are evenly coated.</p>

<h3>2. Baking the Wings</h3>

<p>Place the coated wings on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a wire rack. Make sure the wings are spaced out to allow for even cooking. Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, flipping the wings halfway through to ensure they cook evenly on both sides. The wings should be golden brown and crispy when done.</p>

<h3>3. Making the Gluten-Free Hot Sauce</h3>

<p>While the wings are baking, prepare the hot sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the hot sauce, apple cider vinegar, and honey or maple syrup (if using). Stir the mixture until it is well combined and heated through. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning if necessary. If you prefer a milder sauce, you can reduce the amount of hot sauce or add more butter.</p>

<h3>4. Tossing the Wings in Sauce</h3>

<p>Once the wings are done baking, transfer them to a large bowl. Pour the hot sauce over the wings and toss them until they are evenly coated. For extra crispy wings, you can return them to the oven for an additional 5-10 minutes after tossing them in the sauce.</p>

<h3>5. Serving Your Gluten-Free Hot Wings</h3>

<p>Serve the wings hot, garnished with chopped parsley or green onions if desired. Pair them with your favorite gluten-free dipping sauces, such as ranch or blue cheese dressing, and some celery sticks or carrot sticks for a refreshing contrast to the heat.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Hot Wings</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different type of flour for coating?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour you prefer. Almond flour, rice flour, and chickpea flour are all excellent options. Each flour will give the wings a slightly different texture, so feel free to experiment to find your favorite.</p>

    <h3>2. How can I make the wings spicier?</h3>
    <p>If you prefer your wings extra spicy, you can add more hot sauce to the mixture or include a pinch of cayenne pepper in the flour coating. You can also serve the wings with a side of extra hot sauce for dipping.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make these wings ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>While the wings are best served fresh, you can prepare them ahead of time and reheat them in the oven before serving. To maintain their crispiness, avoid microwaving the wings.</p>

    <h3>4. Are these wings suitable for a keto diet?</h3>
    <p>Yes, these wings can be made keto-friendly by using almond flour instead of rice flour and omitting the honey or maple syrup in the sauce. The rest of the ingredients are naturally low in carbs, making this recipe a great option for those following a keto diet.</p>
