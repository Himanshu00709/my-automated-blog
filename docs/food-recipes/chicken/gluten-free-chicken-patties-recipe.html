    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create delicious gluten-free chicken patties:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground chicken, gluten-free breadcrumbs, egg, minced garlic, chopped onion, parsley, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Patties:</strong> Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions. Shape each portion into a patty, about 1/2 inch thick. Make sure the patties are evenly shaped to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Patties:</strong> Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the patties to the skillet. Cook for about 5-6 minutes on each side, or until the patties are golden brown and cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 165째F (74째C).</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Once cooked, remove the patties from the skillet and let them rest for a few minutes. Serve them on gluten-free buns, over a salad, or with your favorite side dishes.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Chicken Patties</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free chicken patties turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh garlic, onion, and parsley will give your patties the best flavor. Avoid using dried herbs if possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the ingredients can make the patties tough. Mix just until everything is combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Evenly:</strong> Make sure your skillet is evenly heated before adding the patties. This will help them cook evenly and prevent burning.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the Temperature:</strong> Use a meat thermometer to ensure the patties have reached an internal temperature of 165째F (74째C). This is the safe temperature for cooked chicken.</li>
    </ul>
