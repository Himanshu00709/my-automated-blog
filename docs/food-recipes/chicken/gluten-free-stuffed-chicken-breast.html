    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Chicken Breasts</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). While the oven is heating, prepare the chicken breasts. Using a sharp knife, carefully cut a pocket into the side of each chicken breast. Be sure not to cut all the way through; you want to create a space for the stuffing. Season the inside of the pockets with salt, pepper, and a pinch of Italian seasoning.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Gluten-Free Stuffing</h3>

    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, combine the gluten-free breadcrumbs, fresh spinach, feta cheese, minced garlic, and a drizzle of olive oil. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly distributed. This mixture will serve as the stuffing for your chicken breasts. Feel free to customize the stuffing by adding other ingredients like sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms, or herbs.</p>

    <h3>3. Stuffing the Chicken Breasts</h3>

    <p>Once the stuffing is ready, carefully spoon it into the pockets you created in the chicken breasts. Be sure not to overstuff, as this could cause the filling to spill out during cooking. Once stuffed, secure the openings with toothpicks to keep the filling in place.</p>

    <h3>4. Coating the Chicken Breasts</h3>

    <p>Prepare three shallow dishes: one with gluten-free flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with gluten-free breadcrumbs. Dredge each stuffed chicken breast in the flour, then dip it into the beaten eggs, and finally coat it with the breadcrumbs. This step ensures a crispy, golden exterior.</p>

    <h3>5. Baking the Stuffed Chicken Breasts</h3>

    <p>Place the coated chicken breasts on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Drizzle a little olive oil over the top of each breast to help them brown in the oven. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). For an extra crispy finish, you can broil the chicken for the last 2-3 minutes of cooking.</p>

    <h3>6. Serving Your Gluten-Free Stuffed Chicken Breast</h3>

    <p>Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring a moist and flavorful dish. Serve your gluten-free stuffed chicken breast with a side of roasted vegetables, a fresh salad, or gluten-free pasta for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Stuffed Chicken Breast</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different type of cheese for the stuffing?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While feta cheese adds a tangy flavor, you can substitute it with any gluten-free cheese you prefer. Mozzarella, goat cheese, or even a dairy-free alternative would work well.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I know if the chicken is fully cooked?</h3>
        <p>The best way to ensure your chicken is fully cooked is by using a meat thermometer. Insert it into the thickest part of the chicken breast; it should read 165°F (74°C). If you don’t have a thermometer, make a small cut in the center of the chicken to check that the meat is no longer pink.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the stuffed chicken breasts ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before baking. This makes it a great option for meal prep or entertaining.</p>

        <h3>4. What are some gluten-free side dishes to serve with this?</h3>
        <p>There are plenty of gluten-free side dishes that pair well with stuffed chicken breast. Consider serving it with quinoa, roasted sweet potatoes, steamed broccoli, or a fresh green salad.</p>
