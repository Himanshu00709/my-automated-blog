<h1>Gluten-Free Teriyaki Chicken Recipe</h1>

<p>Teriyaki chicken is a beloved dish that combines the savory flavors of soy sauce, ginger, and garlic with a hint of sweetness. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional teriyaki sauce can be off-limits due to the presence of wheat-based soy sauce. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can enjoy a delicious gluten-free version of this classic dish. In this blog post, we’ll walk you through a step-by-step guide to making gluten-free teriyaki chicken that’s just as flavorful and satisfying as the original.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Teriyaki Chicken?</h2>

Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe digestive issues and other health problems for those who are sensitive to it. By using gluten-free soy sauce or tamari, you can create a teriyaki sauce that’s safe for everyone to enjoy. Additionally, this recipe is packed with protein and can be paired with a variety of sides, making it a versatile and healthy meal option.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
<p>Start by cutting the chicken into bite-sized pieces. If you’re using chicken breasts, you may want to pound them slightly to ensure even cooking. Season the chicken lightly with salt and pepper.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Make the Gluten-Free Teriyaki Sauce</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the gluten-free soy sauce, honey (or maple syrup), rice vinegar, minced ginger, and minced garlic. In a separate small bowl, mix the cornstarch with water to create a slurry. This will help thicken the sauce later.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cook the Chicken</h3>
<p>Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until they are browned on all sides and cooked through, about 6-8 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Simmer the Sauce</h3>
<p>In the same skillet, pour in the teriyaki sauce mixture. Bring it to a simmer, then slowly add the cornstarch slurry while stirring continuously. Allow the sauce to thicken for about 2-3 minutes.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Combine Chicken and Sauce</h3>
<p>Return the cooked chicken to the skillet and toss it in the thickened teriyaki sauce. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, ensuring the chicken is well-coated and heated through.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Garnish and Serve</h3>
<p>Transfer the gluten-free teriyaki chicken to a serving dish. Garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions if desired. Serve hot with steamed rice or your favorite gluten-free side dishes.</p>
