<h2>Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
<p>Start by cutting the chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces. This will ensure that the chicken cooks evenly and absorbs the flavors of the teriyaki sauce more effectively. Set the chicken aside while you prepare the sauce.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Make the Gluten-Free Teriyaki Sauce</h3>
<p>In a medium-sized bowl, combine the gluten-free tamari sauce, honey (or maple syrup), rice vinegar, minced ginger, and minced garlic. Stir the mixture until the honey is fully dissolved. In a separate small bowl, mix the cornstarch with water to create a slurry. This will help thicken the sauce later on.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cook the Chicken</h3>
<p>Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until they are browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Once the chicken is cooked through, reduce the heat to medium and pour the teriyaki sauce over the chicken. Stir well to coat the chicken evenly.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Thicken the Sauce</h3>
<p>Add the cornstarch slurry to the skillet and stir continuously. The sauce will begin to thicken within a few minutes. Continue to cook for another 2-3 minutes, or until the sauce reaches your desired consistency.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</h3>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, remove the skillet from the heat. Garnish the gluten-free teriyaki chicken with sesame seeds and sliced green onions if desired. Serve the chicken over steamed rice or alongside your favorite gluten-free noodles for a complete meal.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Teriyaki Chicken</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use regular soy sauce instead of tamari?</h3>
    <p>No, regular soy sauce contains gluten, which makes it unsuitable for a gluten-free diet. Tamari is a gluten-free alternative that provides a similar flavor profile without the gluten.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the gluten-free teriyaki chicken ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat it gently on the stove or in the microwave before serving.</p>

    <h3>3. What can I serve with gluten-free teriyaki chicken?</h3>
    <p>This dish pairs well with steamed rice, quinoa, or gluten-free noodles. You can also serve it with a side of steamed vegetables for a balanced meal.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I freeze the cooked chicken?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the cooked gluten-free teriyaki chicken in an airtight container for up to 2 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before reheating.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
