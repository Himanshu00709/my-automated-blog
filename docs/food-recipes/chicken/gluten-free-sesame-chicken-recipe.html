    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the cooking process:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Begin by cutting the chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces. In a large bowl, toss the chicken pieces with cornstarch until they are evenly coated. This will help create a crispy exterior when the chicken is cooked.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken pieces in a single layer. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, whisk together the gluten-free soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, sesame oil, minced garlic, and minced ginger. This mixture will serve as the flavorful sauce for your sesame chicken.</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Combine Chicken and Sauce</h3>
    <p>Return the cooked chicken to the skillet and pour the sauce over it. Stir well to ensure that the chicken is evenly coated with the sauce. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken and the flavors to meld together.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Finally, sprinkle the sesame seeds and chopped green onions over the chicken. Serve the gluten-free sesame chicken hot, preferably over a bed of steamed rice or alongside your favorite vegetables.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Sesame Chicken</h2>
    <p>To ensure that your gluten-free sesame chicken turns out perfectly every time, here are a few tips to keep in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a non-stick skillet:</strong> This will help prevent the chicken from sticking and ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overcrowd the skillet:</strong> Cook the chicken in batches if necessary to avoid steaming instead of browning.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a sweeter sauce, you can add a bit more honey to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for gluten-free labels:</strong> Always double-check that your soy sauce and other ingredients are certified gluten-free to avoid any cross-contamination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can absolutely use chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. Thighs tend to be more flavorful and juicy, so they can be a great alternative if you prefer dark meat.</p>
        <h3>Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
