<h1>Hollandaise Sauce: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

<p>Hollandaise sauce is a classic French sauce known for its rich, buttery flavor and velvety texture. Traditionally made with egg yolks, butter, lemon juice, and a touch of seasoning, it is a staple in many gourmet dishes, particularly eggs Benedict. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question often arises: Is hollandaise sauce gluten-free? The good news is that, when made traditionally, hollandaise sauce is naturally gluten-free. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free hollandaise sauce, including its ingredients, preparation, and how to ensure it remains safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>What Makes Hollandaise Sauce Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Hollandaise sauce is inherently gluten-free because its core ingredients—egg yolks, butter, lemon juice, and seasonings—do not contain gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives, none of which are used in traditional hollandaise recipes. However, it’s essential to be cautious about potential cross-contamination or the addition of gluten-containing ingredients in pre-made or restaurant versions of the sauce.</p>
