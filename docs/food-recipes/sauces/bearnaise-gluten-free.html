    <h1>Béarnaise Sauce: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>Béarnaise sauce is a classic French sauce that has been a staple in gourmet cooking for centuries. Known for its rich, buttery flavor and velvety texture, it is often paired with steak, seafood, and vegetables. For those following a gluten-free diet, the good news is that traditional béarnaise sauce is naturally gluten-free.

In this article, we’ll explore the origins of béarnaise sauce, its gluten-free status, and how you can make it at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Béarnaise Sauce?</h2>
    <p>Béarnaise sauce is a derivative of hollandaise sauce, one of the five mother sauces in French cuisine. It is made by emulsifying butter into egg yolks and white wine vinegar, flavored with tarragon, shallots, and black pepper. The result is a creamy, tangy sauce that elevates any dish it accompanies. The sauce is named after the Béarn region in southwestern France, where it is believed to have originated.</p>

    <p>Yes, traditional béarnaise sauce is gluten-free. The primary ingredients—egg yolks, butter, white wine vinegar, tarragon, shallots, and black pepper—are all naturally free of gluten. However, it’s crucial to be cautious when ordering béarnaise sauce in restaurants or purchasing pre-made versions, as some may contain additives or thickeners that include gluten. Always check the label or ask the chef to confirm its gluten-free status.</p>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Once melted, set it aside to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>In a separate saucepan, combine the white wine vinegar, shallots, tarragon, and black pepper. Simmer over medium heat until the liquid is reduced by half. Strain the mixture and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks until they become pale and slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method) and slowly drizzle in the melted butter while continuously whisking. Ensure the butter is incorporated gradually to create a smooth emulsion.</li>
        <li>Add the reduced vinegar mixture to the egg yolk and butter mixture, whisking continuously. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and serve immediately. If the sauce thickens too much, you can thin it with a teaspoon of warm water.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Béarnaise Sauce</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh tarragon and high-quality butter make a significant difference in flavor.</li>
