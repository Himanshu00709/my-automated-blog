    <h1>Gluten-Free Sweet and Sour Sauce for Meatballs</h1>

    <p>Sweet and sour sauce is a classic condiment that adds a delightful tangy and sweet flavor to a variety of dishes. When paired with meatballs, it creates a mouthwatering combination that is perfect for appetizers, main courses, or even party platters.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making your gluten-free sweet and sour sauce:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Combine the Base Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the tomato ketchup, apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, gluten-free soy sauce, pineapple juice, garlic powder, and onion powder. Stir well to ensure all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Adjust Seasoning</h3>
