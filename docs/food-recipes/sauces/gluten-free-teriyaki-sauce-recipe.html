<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Combine the Base Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a small saucepan, combine the gluten-free soy sauce, water, honey (or maple syrup), rice vinegar, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Stir well to ensure all ingredients are evenly mixed.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Heat the Mixture</h3>
<p>Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking or burning.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Thicken the Sauce</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of cold water to create a slurry. Slowly pour the slurry into the simmering sauce while stirring continuously. This will help thicken the sauce to your desired consistency. Allow the sauce to simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes until it thickens.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Sesame Oil (Optional)</h3>
<p>If you’re using sesame oil, stir it into the sauce at the very end. This will add a rich, nutty flavor to the teriyaki sauce.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Cool and Store</h3>
<p>Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the sauce cool completely. Once cooled, transfer it to an airtight container or jar. Store in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.</p>
