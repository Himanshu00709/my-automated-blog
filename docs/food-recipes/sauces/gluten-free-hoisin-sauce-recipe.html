<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Combine the Base Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, mix the gluten-free soy sauce or tamari with the black bean paste. Stir until the paste is fully dissolved and the mixture is smooth.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Add Sweetness and Tang</h3>
<p>Incorporate the honey or maple syrup and rice vinegar into the mixture. These ingredients provide the signature sweet and tangy notes of hoisin sauce.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Season the Sauce</h3>
<p>Add the garlic powder, sesame oil, and Chinese five-spice powder. Stir well to ensure the spices are evenly distributed.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Adjust Consistency</h3>
<p>Gradually add water, one tablespoon at a time, until the sauce reaches your desired thickness. For a thicker sauce, use less water; for a thinner consistency, add more.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Taste and Adjust</h3>
<p>Give the sauce a taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. You can add more honey for sweetness, rice vinegar for tanginess, or five-spice powder for a deeper flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Store and Serve</h3>
<p>Transfer the sauce to an airtight container and refrigerate. It will keep for up to two weeks. Use it as a dipping sauce, marinade, or glaze for your favorite dishes.</p>
