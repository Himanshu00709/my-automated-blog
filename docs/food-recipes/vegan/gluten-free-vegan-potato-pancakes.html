    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to make your gluten-free vegan potato pancakes:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Flax Egg:</strong> In a small bowl, mix the flaxseed meal with water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it thickens. This will act as a binder in place of eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Grate the Potatoes and Onion:</strong> Peel and grate the potatoes using a box grater or food processor. Grate the onion as well. Place the grated potatoes and onion in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much moisture as possible. This step is crucial for achieving crispy pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the grated potatoes, onion, gluten-free flour, salt, pepper, and the prepared flax egg. Mix well until everything is evenly combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong> In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Make sure the oil is hot but not smoking.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Pancakes:</strong> Take a small handful of the potato mixture and form it into a pancake shape, about 1/4 inch thick. Carefully place it in the hot oil. Repeat with the remaining mixture, making sure not to overcrowd the skillet.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Until Golden Brown:</strong> Cook the pancakes for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as vegan sour cream, applesauce, or fresh herbs.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Vegan Potato Pancakes</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these pancakes ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the potato mixture ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. When you’re ready to cook, simply form the pancakes and fry them as directed. You can also cook the pancakes in advance and reheat them in the oven or toaster for a quick meal.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of flaxseed meal?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have flaxseed meal, you can use chia seeds as a substitute. Simply mix 2 tablespoons of chia seeds with 6 tablespoons of water and let it sit until it forms a gel-like consistency. This will work as a binder just like the flaxseed meal.</p>

        <h3>Are these pancakes freezer-friendly?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Once the pancakes are cooked and cooled, you can place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze them. Once frozen, transfer them to a zip-top bag or airtight container. They can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply bake them in the oven at 375°F (190°C) until heated through and crispy.</p>

        <h3>Can I bake these pancakes instead of frying them?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake the pancakes for a healthier option. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the formed pancakes on the sheet and lightly brush them with olive oil. Bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until they are golden brown and crispy.</p>
