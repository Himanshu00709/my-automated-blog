        <h2>FAQs</h2>

        <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>No, regular flour contains gluten, which is not suitable for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Always use a certified gluten-free flour blend for these recipes.</p>

        <h3>2. What can I use instead of dairy-free whipped cream?</h3>
        <p>You can use coconut whipped cream or any other plant-based whipped cream alternative. Make sure it’s unsweetened if you prefer a less sweet dessert.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make these recipes ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, all of these recipes can be prepared ahead of time. Store the cookies in an airtight container, the stuffing in the refrigerator, and the Yule Log in the fridge until ready to serve.</p>
