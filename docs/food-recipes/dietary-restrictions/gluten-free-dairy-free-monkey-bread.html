<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, salt, and 1/2 cup of sugar. Mix well. Add the melted coconut oil, almond milk, and vanilla extract. Stir until a soft dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour, but be careful not to overmix.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Shape the Dough</h3>
<p>Divide the dough into small, bite-sized pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, about 1 inch in diameter. In a separate bowl, mix the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar with the cinnamon. Roll each dough ball in the cinnamon-sugar mixture until fully coated.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble the Monkey Bread</h3>
<p>Grease a bundt pan with coconut oil or dairy-free butter. Arrange the coated dough balls in the pan, layering them evenly. Drizzle any remaining cinnamon-sugar mixture over the top.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Bake</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the monkey bread for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the dough is cooked through. Allow it to cool for 10 minutes before inverting it onto a serving plate.</p>
