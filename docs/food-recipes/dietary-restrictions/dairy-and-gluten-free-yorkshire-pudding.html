    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making dairy and gluten-free Yorkshire pudding:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F). Place a muffin tin or Yorkshire pudding tin in the oven to heat up. The hot tin is crucial for achieving the perfect rise and crispiness.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 120g of gluten-free flour blend and a pinch of salt. Make a well in the center and crack in 3 large eggs. Gradually whisk in 200ml of non-dairy milk until you have a smooth batter. Let the batter rest for at least 30 minutes to allow the gluten-free flour to hydrate.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Fat to the Tin</h3>
    <p>Carefully remove the hot tin from the oven and add a small amount of vegetable oil or dairy-free margarine to each compartment. Return the tin to the oven for a few minutes until the fat is sizzling hot.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Pour the Batter</h3>
    <p>Quickly pour the batter into the hot tin, filling each compartment about halfway. Be careful not to overfill, as the puddings will rise during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the tin back in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the puddings are golden brown and puffed up. Avoid opening the oven door during baking, as this can cause the puddings to collapse.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the Yorkshire puddings from the oven and serve immediately. They are best enjoyed fresh and hot, alongside your favorite roast and vegetables.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Dairy and Gluten-Free Yorkshire Pudding</h2>

    <p>Here are some additional tips to ensure your dairy and gluten-free Yorkshire puddings turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking and has a good balance of starches and proteins.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the batter rest:</strong> Allowing the batter to rest gives the gluten-free flour time to absorb the liquid, resulting in a smoother texture and better rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep the fat hot:</strong> The key to a good rise is pouring the batter into sizzling hot fat. Make sure the oil or margarine is piping hot before adding the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overfill the tin:</strong> Yorkshire puddings need room to rise, so be careful not to overfill the compartments. Filling them halfway is usually sufficient.</li>
    </ul>
