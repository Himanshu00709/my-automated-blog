    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Mashed Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Start by boiling the peeled and cubed potatoes in a large pot of salted water until they are tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot. Add the dairy-free butter and almond milk, then mash until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>2. Cook the Meat Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or lamb over medium heat until browned. Drain any excess fat. Add the chopped onion, carrots, celery, and garlic to the skillet and cook until the vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and gluten-free flour, then gradually add the broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Simmer until the mixture thickens, then add the frozen peas if using. Season with salt and pepper.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Shepherd's Pie</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer the meat filling to a baking dish and spread it evenly. Top with the mashed potatoes, spreading them out to cover the filling completely. Use a fork to create a decorative pattern on the surface of the potatoes.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake and Serve</h3>
    <p>Bake the Shepherd's Pie in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy your gluten-free and dairy-free Shepherd's Pie with a side of steamed vegetables or a fresh salad.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use ground turkey, chicken, or even a plant-based meat substitute if you prefer. Just adjust the cooking time accordingly.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free flour on hand, you can use cornstarch or arrowroot powder as a thickening agent for the filling.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can assemble the Shepherd's Pie a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. Just bake it when you’re ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can be made vegan by using a plant-based meat substitute and ensuring that all other ingredients, such as the broth and dairy-free butter, are vegan-friendly.</p>
