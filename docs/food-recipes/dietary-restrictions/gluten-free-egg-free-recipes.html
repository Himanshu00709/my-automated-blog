    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of almond flour in these recipes?</h3>
        <p>No, regular flour contains gluten, which is not suitable for a gluten-free diet. Almond flour is a great alternative, but you can also use other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or oat flour.</p>

        <h3>2. What can I use as an egg substitute in baking?</h3>
        <p>There are several egg substitutes you can use in baking, such as chia seeds, flaxseed meal, applesauce, or mashed bananas. Each substitute works differently, so it's important to choose the one that best fits your recipe.</p>

        <h3>3. Are these recipes suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Most of these recipes are vegan-friendly, but it's always a good idea to check the ingredients to ensure they align with your dietary preferences. For example, some recipes may use honey, which is not considered vegan, so you can substitute it with maple syrup.</p>
