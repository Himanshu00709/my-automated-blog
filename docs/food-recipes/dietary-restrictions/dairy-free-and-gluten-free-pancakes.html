<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Dairy-Free and Gluten-Free Pancakes</h2>

<p>Making dairy-free and gluten-free pancakes is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a delicious stack of pancakes that everyone can enjoy:</p>

<h3>1. Gather Your Ingredients</h3>

<p>Before you start, make sure you have all the necessary ingredients on hand. This includes your choice of gluten-free flour, dairy-free milk, and any additional flavorings or toppings you want to use.</p>

<h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine your gluten-free flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure they are well combined.</p>

<h3>3. Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together your dairy-free milk, eggs (or egg substitute), and any other wet ingredients, such as melted coconut oil or vanilla extract.</p>

<h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense pancakes.</p>

<h3>5. Cook the Pancakes</h3>

<p>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease the surface with a small amount of oil or vegan butter. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.</p>

<h3>6. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Serve your pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as fresh fruit, maple syrup, or dairy-free whipped cream.</p>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make these pancakes vegan?</h3>

    <h3>What is the best gluten-free flour for pancakes?</h3>
    <p>The best gluten-free flour for pancakes depends on your personal preference. Almond flour and coconut flour are popular choices, but you can also use a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend for a more traditional texture.</p>
