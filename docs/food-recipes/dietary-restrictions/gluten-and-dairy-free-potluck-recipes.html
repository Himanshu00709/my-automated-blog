    <h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Potluck Recipes: A Guide to Delicious and Inclusive Dishes</h1>

    <p>Potlucks are a fantastic way to bring people together, share delicious food, and enjoy a variety of flavors. However, for those with dietary restrictions, such as gluten or dairy intolerance, potlucks can sometimes be a challenge. The good news is that with a little creativity and planning, you can create gluten and dairy-free dishes that everyone will love. In this blog post, we’ll explore some mouth-watering recipes that are perfect for your next potluck, ensuring that everyone at the table can enjoy the feast without worry.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten and Dairy-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten and dairy are common allergens and intolerances that affect millions of people worldwide. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and other health problems for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Dairy, on the other hand, can be problematic for individuals who are lactose intolerant or have a milk allergy. By offering gluten and dairy-free options at your potluck, you’re not only catering to those with dietary restrictions but also promoting inclusivity and health-conscious eating.</p>
