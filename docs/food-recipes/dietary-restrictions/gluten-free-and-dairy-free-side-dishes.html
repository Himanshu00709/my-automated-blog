    <h3>2. Sweet Potato Fries</h3>
    <p>Sweet potato fries are a crowd-pleaser and a healthier alternative to traditional fries.

Bake in the oven until crispy, and serve with a dairy-free dipping sauce like avocado aioli.</p>

    <h3>3. Cauliflower Rice Pilaf</h3>
    <p>Cauliflower rice is a low-carb, gluten-free substitute for traditional rice. Sauté cauliflower rice with onions, garlic, and your choice of vegetables like peas, carrots, and bell peppers.
