    <h1>Gluten-Free Low Sodium Recipes: A Healthy Culinary Journey</h1>
    <p>In today’s health-conscious world, many individuals are seeking ways to improve their diets by reducing gluten and sodium intake. Whether you’re managing celiac disease, hypertension, or simply aiming for a healthier lifestyle, gluten-free and low-sodium recipes can be a game-changer.

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free and Low Sodium?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe digestive issues and other health problems for those who are intolerant.

Combining these two dietary approaches can lead to a healthier, more balanced lifestyle.</p>

        <li><strong>Herbs and Spices:</strong> Fresh or dried herbs like basil, oregano, and thyme, along with spices such as turmeric and cumin, can add flavor without the need for salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Low-Sodium Broths:</strong> Opt for low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth to enhance the flavor of soups and stews.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh Produce:</strong> Incorporate a variety of fruits and vegetables to add natural flavors and nutrients to your meals.</li>
    </ul>
