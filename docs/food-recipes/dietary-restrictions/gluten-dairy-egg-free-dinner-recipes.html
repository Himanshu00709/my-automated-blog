    <h1>Gluten, Dairy, and Egg-Free Dinner Recipes: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

For those who need to avoid gluten, dairy, and eggs, finding dinner recipes that are both nutritious and flavorful can seem daunting.

    <h2>Why Gluten, Dairy, and Egg-Free?</h2>

Eggs, while a common ingredient in many recipes, can also trigger allergic reactions in some people. By eliminating these ingredients, individuals can often alleviate symptoms such as digestive issues, skin problems, and more.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I substitute quinoa with another grain?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute quinoa with other gluten-free grains like rice, millet, or buckwheat. However, keep in mind that quinoa is a complete protein, so you may want to add another protein source if using a different grain.</p>

        <h3>2. What can I use instead of coconut milk in the curry?</h3>
        <p>If you’re not a fan of coconut milk, you can use almond milk or cashew cream as a substitute. Both will provide a creamy texture without the coconut flavor.</p>

        <h3>3. Are zucchini noodles as filling as regular pasta?</h3>
        <p>Zucchini noodles are lighter than traditional pasta, so you may find them less filling. To make the dish more satisfying, consider adding a protein source like grilled chicken, tofu, or chickpeas.</p>
