<h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Corn Casserole: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten and dairy-free corn casserole:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your casserole bakes evenly.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the cornbread mix:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free cornbread mix with the unsweetened almond milk, melted dairy-free butter, and eggs. Mix until well combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the corn kernels:</strong> Gently fold in the corn kernels, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the mixture. If you’re using dairy-free sour cream, add it at this stage for extra creaminess.</li>
    <li><strong>Season the mixture:</strong> Add salt and pepper to taste, and give the mixture one final stir to ensure all ingredients are well incorporated.</li>
    <li><strong>Transfer to a baking dish:</strong> Pour the mixture into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish, spreading it out evenly.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the casserole to cool for a few minutes before serving. This dish pairs well with a variety of main courses or can be enjoyed on its own.</li>
