    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten and dairy-free mashed potatoes is straightforward and requires just a few simple steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Peel and chop the potatoes:</strong> Start by peeling the potatoes and cutting them into evenly sized chunks. This ensures they cook evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Boil the potatoes:</strong> Place the potato chunks in a large pot and cover them with cold water. Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil. Cook until the potatoes are tender, about 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and mash:</strong> Once the potatoes are cooked, drain them well and return them to the pot. Use a potato masher or a hand mixer to mash the potatoes until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Add dairy-free ingredients:</strong> Stir in the dairy-free milk and butter. Mix until the potatoes are creamy and well combined. Add salt, pepper, and garlic (if using) to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and enjoy:</strong> Transfer the mashed potatoes to a serving dish and garnish with fresh herbs like chives or parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten and Dairy-Free Mashed Potatoes</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your mashed potatoes turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the right potatoes:</strong> Yukon Gold or Russet potatoes are ideal for mashing because of their high starch content.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t over-mash:</strong> Over-mashing can make the potatoes gluey. Mash just until they’re smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li><strong>Warm the dairy-free milk:</strong> Cold milk can cool down the potatoes and make them less creamy. Warm the milk slightly before adding it to the potatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Add roasted garlic, nutritional yeast, or fresh herbs to enhance the flavor of your mashed potatoes.</li>
    </ul>
