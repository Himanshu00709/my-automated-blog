    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Start by peeling and cutting the potatoes into evenly sized chunks. This ensures they cook evenly. Rinse the potatoes under cold water to remove excess starch, which can make the mashed potatoes gluey.</p>

    <h3>2. Cook the Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Place the potato chunks in a large pot and cover them with cold water. Add a pinch of salt to the water. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat and let the potatoes simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are fork-tender.</p>

    <h3>3. Drain and Mash</h3>
    <p>Once the potatoes are cooked, drain them thoroughly in a colander. Return the potatoes to the pot and mash them using a potato masher or a fork. For a smoother texture, you can use a hand mixer or a food processor.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Dairy-Free Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add the olive oil or vegan butter, almond milk or coconut milk, and minced garlic (if using) to the mashed potatoes. Mix well until the ingredients are fully incorporated. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>5. Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>For an extra touch of flavor, garnish the mashed potatoes with fresh herbs like chives, parsley, or rosemary. Serve warm and enjoy!</p>
