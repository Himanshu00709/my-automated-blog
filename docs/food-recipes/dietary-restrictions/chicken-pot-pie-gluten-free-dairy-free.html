    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>

    <p>Start by making the crust. In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of gluten-free flour blend with 1/2 cup of dairy-free butter. Use a pastry cutter or your hands to mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add 1/2 cup of unsweetened almond milk, mixing until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>

    <p>While the dough chills, prepare the filling. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of dairy-free butter over medium heat. Add 2 cups of mixed vegetables and sauté until tender. Stir in 2 cups of cooked chicken breast, 2 cups of gluten-free chicken broth, and season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and dried thyme. Simmer for 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Pot Pie</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the chilled dough on a floured surface (use gluten-free flour) to fit your pie dish. Pour the filling into the dish and cover with the rolled-out dough. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges to seal. Cut a few slits in the top to allow steam to escape.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>

    <p>Bake the pot pie in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours like almond flour or coconut flour, but keep in mind that the texture may vary. A gluten-free flour blend is recommended for the best results.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of dairy-free butter?</h3>
        <p>You can use coconut oil or another plant-based fat as a substitute for dairy-free butter. Just ensure it's solid at room temperature for the crust.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the filling and crust ahead of time and assemble the pot pie just before baking. Alternatively, you can freeze the unbaked pot pie and bake it directly from the freezer, adding a few extra minutes to the baking time.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can be made vegan by substituting the chicken with plant-based protein like tofu or chickpeas. Ensure all other ingredients, like the broth, are vegan-friendly.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This gluten-free dairy-free chicken pot pie is proof that dietary restrictions don't have to mean sacrificing flavor or comfort. With a flaky, buttery crust and a rich, savory filling, this dish is sure to satisfy even the pickiest eaters. Whether you're cooking for yourself or a loved one with dietary needs, this recipe is a delicious way to enjoy a classic comfort food without compromise.
