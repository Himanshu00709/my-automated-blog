    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. Mix these dry ingredients thoroughly to ensure even distribution. In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond milk, apple cider vinegar, and maple syrup. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a dough forms. Gently fold in the fresh blueberries, being careful not to crush them.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Shape the Bagels</h3>

    <p>Divide the dough into 6 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball, then use your thumb to create a hole in the center, shaping it into a bagel. Place the shaped bagels on a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving enough space between each one to allow for expansion during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Bagels</h3>

    <p>Brush the tops of the bagels lightly with olive oil to help them achieve a golden-brown color. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the bagels are firm to the touch and lightly browned. Remove from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack before serving.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>

    <p>These gluten-free blueberry bagels are incredibly versatile. Enjoy them plain, or spread with your favorite toppings such as cream cheese, almond butter, or a drizzle of honey. They also pair wonderfully with a cup of coffee or tea for a delightful breakfast or snack.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries if fresh ones are not available. However, be sure to thaw and drain them thoroughly before adding to the dough to prevent excess moisture.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of almond milk?</h3>
        <p>You can substitute almond milk with any other plant-based milk, such as oat milk, soy milk, or coconut milk. Dairy milk can also be used if you don’t have dietary restrictions.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these bagels?</h3>
        <p>Store the bagels in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 2 months. Simply thaw and reheat before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these bagels vegan?</h3>
        <p>This recipe is already vegan as it uses plant-based milk and no animal products. Just ensure that your gluten-free flour blend and other ingredients are vegan-friendly.</p>
