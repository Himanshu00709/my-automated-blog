    <h3>2. Gingerbread Cookies</h3>
    <p>Nothing says Christmas like gingerbread cookies. This gluten-free dairy-free version uses molasses, ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg for that classic spicy flavor. Use a mix of gluten-free flours to achieve the perfect texture, and don't forget to decorate with dairy-free icing.</p>

    <h2>Baking Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free dairy-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with the right techniques, you can achieve perfect results every time. Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Measure Accurately:</strong> Gluten-free flours can be denser than regular flour, so it's important to measure your ingredients carefully to avoid dry or crumbly cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Gluten-free dough can be stickier than traditional dough. Chilling it before baking will make it easier to handle and help the cookies hold their shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix your ingredients just until combined to ensure a tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Parchment Paper:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can be more delicate, so using parchment paper will prevent them from sticking to the baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Don't be afraid to get creative with your flavorings. Add citrus zest, spices, or even a pinch of sea salt to enhance the taste of your cookies.</li>
    </ul>
