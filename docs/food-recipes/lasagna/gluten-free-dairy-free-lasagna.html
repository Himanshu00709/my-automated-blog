    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). While the oven is heating, chop the onion and mince the garlic. If you're using fresh spinach, wash and chop it. If you're using frozen spinach, make sure to thaw and drain it well.</p>

    <h3>2. Cook the Ground Meat or Plant-Based Alternative</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until the onion is translucent. Add the ground meat or plant-based alternative and cook until browned. If you're using lentils, make sure they are cooked through. Season with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
    <p>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of gluten-free lasagna noodles over the sauce. Add a layer of the cooked meat or plant-based mixture, followed by a layer of spinach. Sprinkle some dairy-free cheese on top. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of tomato sauce and a generous sprinkle of dairy-free cheese.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this lasagna ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can assemble the lasagna ahead of time and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours before baking. Just make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. When you're ready to bake, remove the covering and bake as directed.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of dairy-free cheese?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use dairy-free cheese, you can make a cashew cream sauce or use a tofu-based ricotta as a substitute. Both options will add creaminess and flavor to your lasagna.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free dairy-free lasagna?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can freeze the lasagna either before or after baking. If freezing before baking, assemble the lasagna in a freezer-safe dish, cover it tightly, and freeze for up to 3 months. When ready to bake, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and then bake as directed. If freezing after baking, let the lasagna cool completely, then wrap it tightly and freeze. Reheat in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until heated through.</p>
