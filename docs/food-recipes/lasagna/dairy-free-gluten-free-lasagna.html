<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Vegetables and Sauce</h3>

<p>Start by heating the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, sautéing until they become fragrant and translucent. Next, add the plant-based ground meat and cook until it’s browned and heated through. Stir in the marinara sauce, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</p>

<h3>2. Cook the Gluten-Free Lasagna Noodles</h3>

<p>While the sauce is simmering, cook the gluten-free lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Be careful not to overcook them, as they will continue to cook in the oven. Once done, drain the noodles and set them aside.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble the Lasagna</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the marinara sauce mixture on the bottom. Place a layer of gluten-free lasagna noodles over the sauce. Add a layer of the spinach and zucchini slices, followed by a layer of dairy-free cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of dairy-free cheese on top.</p>

<h3>4. Bake the Lasagna</h3>

<p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

<p>This dairy-free gluten-free lasagna is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. The gluten-free noodles provide a safe alternative for those with gluten sensitivities, while the dairy-free cheese offers a lower-fat option that’s easier on the digestive system. The spinach and zucchini add a boost of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin A, vitamin C, and potassium. The plant-based ground meat is a great source of protein and fiber, making this lasagna a well-rounded meal.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use regular lasagna noodles if I’m not gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use regular lasagna noodles if you don’t have a gluten sensitivity. However, the recipe is designed to be gluten-free, so be sure to check the ingredients if you’re catering to someone with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of dairy-free cheese?</h3>
    <p>If you prefer not to use dairy-free cheese, you can make a cashew-based cheese sauce or use a tofu ricotta as a substitute. Both options provide a creamy texture and rich flavor without the dairy.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze this lasagna?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! This lasagna freezes well. Simply assemble the lasagna as directed, but instead of baking it, cover it tightly with plastic wrap and aluminum foil, then freeze. When you’re ready to eat, bake it from frozen, adding an extra 20-30 minutes to the baking time.</p>

    <h3>Is this lasagna suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>Yes, this lasagna is vegan-friendly as long as you use plant-based ground meat and dairy-free cheese. Be sure to check the labels on all ingredients to ensure they meet vegan standards.</p>
