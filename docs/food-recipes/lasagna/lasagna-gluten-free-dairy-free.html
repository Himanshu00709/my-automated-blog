    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Lasagna</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Gluten-Free Lasagna Noodles</h3>
    <p>Start by boiling the gluten-free lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Be sure not to overcook them, as they will continue to cook in the oven. Once cooked, drain and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Dairy-Free Ricotta Filling</h3>
    <p>In a food processor, blend together tofu or soaked cashews, nutritional yeast, garlic, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt until smooth. This mixture will serve as your dairy-free ricotta filling. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Tomato Sauce</h3>
    <p>If you’re using store-bought tomato sauce, ensure it’s gluten-free. Alternatively, you can make your own by sautéing onions and garlic in olive oil, then adding crushed tomatoes, basil, oregano, and a pinch of sugar. Simmer for 15-20 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the bottom. Add a layer of gluten-free lasagna noodles, followed by a layer of the dairy-free ricotta mixture, and then a layer of dairy-free cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of tomato sauce and dairy-free cheese on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly. Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes before serving.</p>
