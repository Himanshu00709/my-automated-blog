    <h1>Gluten-Free Christmas Sides: A Festive Feast for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Christmas is a time for joy, family, and, of course, delicious food. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, navigating the holiday table can be a challenge. Fear not!

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Christmas Sides Matter</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or wheat allergies. Even a small amount of gluten can cause severe reactions in these individuals. By offering gluten-free options, you ensure that everyone at your table can enjoy the meal without worry. Plus, gluten-free dishes can be just as flavorful and satisfying as traditional ones, making them a great addition to any holiday spread.</p>

    <p>Here are some mouth-watering gluten-free side dishes that will complement your Christmas meal perfectly:</p>

    <h3>1. Roasted Garlic Mashed Cauliflower</h3>

    <h3>2. Gluten-Free Stuffing</h3>
    <p>No Christmas meal is complete without stuffing. Using gluten-free bread or cornbread as the base, you can create a stuffing that’s just as delicious as the traditional version. Add in herbs, vegetables, and a bit of broth for a savory side that everyone will love.</p>

    <h3>3. Honey-Glazed Carrots</h3>
    <p>Sweet, tender, and slightly caramelized, honey-glazed carrots are a simple yet elegant side dish. The natural sweetness of the carrots pairs beautifully with the honey glaze, making it a perfect addition to your holiday table.</p>

    <h3>4. Quinoa Salad with Pomegranate and Walnuts</h3>
    <p>For a lighter option, consider a quinoa salad. Packed with protein and fiber, quinoa is a nutritious base for a festive salad. Add pomegranate seeds, walnuts, and a tangy vinaigrette for a dish that’s both healthy and delicious.</p>
