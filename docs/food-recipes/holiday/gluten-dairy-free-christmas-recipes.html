    <h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Christmas Recipes: A Festive Feast for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Christmas is a time for joy, family, and, of course, delicious food. However, for those with dietary restrictions, the holiday season can sometimes feel overwhelming.

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these recipes ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, many of these recipes can be prepared in advance. For example, the stuffing can be assembled a day ahead and baked just before serving. The mashed potatoes can also be made ahead and reheated with a splash of almond milk to keep them creamy.</p>

        <h3>Are these recipes suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Most of these recipes are vegan-friendly, but it's always a good idea to double-check the ingredients. For example, ensure that the gluten-free bread used in the stuffing is vegan, as some brands may contain eggs.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute almond milk with another non-dairy milk?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can use any non-dairy milk you prefer, such as oat milk, soy milk, or coconut milk. Each will impart a slightly different flavor, so choose one that complements the dish.</p>
