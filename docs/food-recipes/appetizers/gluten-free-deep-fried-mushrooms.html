<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Mushrooms</h3>
<p>Start by cleaning the mushrooms thoroughly. Use a damp paper towel to wipe off any dirt. Avoid soaking them in water, as mushrooms absorb moisture, which can affect the frying process. Trim the stems if necessary, but leave the mushrooms whole for the best texture.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Make the Batter</h3>
<p>In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, cornstarch, salt, and pepper. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until you achieve a smooth, lump-free batter. The consistency should be thick enough to coat the mushrooms evenly.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Coat the Mushrooms</h3>
<p>Dip each mushroom into the batter, ensuring it’s fully coated. Allow any excess batter to drip off before proceeding to the next step. For an extra crispy texture, you can double-coat the mushrooms by dipping them in the batter a second time.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Heat the Oil</h3>
<p>In a deep frying pan or pot, heat the oil to 350°F (175°C). Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature, as maintaining the right heat is crucial for achieving a crispy exterior without overcooking the mushrooms.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Fry the Mushrooms</h3>
<p>Carefully place the battered mushrooms into the hot oil, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. Fry them in batches for 3-4 minutes or until golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to remove the mushrooms and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Serve the gluten-free deep-fried mushrooms immediately while they’re still hot and crispy. Pair them with your favorite dipping sauce, such as ranch, garlic aioli, or a spicy sriracha mayo.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Deep Fried Mushrooms</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Fresh Mushrooms:</strong> Fresh mushrooms yield the best texture and flavor. Avoid using canned or pre-packaged mushrooms.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintain Oil Temperature:</strong> Keep the oil at a consistent temperature to prevent soggy or greasy mushrooms.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Seasonings:</strong> Add herbs and spices like paprika, garlic powder, or cayenne pepper to the batter for extra flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve Immediately:</strong> Deep-fried foods are best enjoyed fresh. If you need to reheat them, use an oven or air fryer to retain crispiness.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use other types of mushrooms?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use other varieties like shiitake or portobello mushrooms. However, button and cremini mushrooms are preferred for their size and texture.</p>

    <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour for frying?</h3>
    <p>Rice flour and almond flour are excellent choices for gluten-free frying. They provide a light and crispy coating.</p>

    <h3>Can I bake these mushrooms instead of frying?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can bake them at 400°F (200°C) for 15-20 minutes. However, the texture won’t be as crispy as deep-fried mushrooms.</p>

    <h3>Are these mushrooms suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>To make this recipe vegan, replace the eggs with a flaxseed or chia seed egg and use a plant-based milk alternative.</p>
