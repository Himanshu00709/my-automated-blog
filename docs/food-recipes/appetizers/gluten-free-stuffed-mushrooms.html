    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Mushrooms</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). While the oven is heating, clean the mushrooms thoroughly. Gently wipe them with a damp cloth or paper towel to remove any dirt. Carefully remove the stems from the mushrooms, creating a hollow cavity for the stuffing. Chop the stems finely and set them aside.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Stuffing</h3>

    <p>In a medium-sized skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped mushroom stems and minced garlic, sautéing until the stems are soft and the garlic is fragrant, about 3-4 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the mixture cool slightly.</p>

    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the sautéed mushroom stems and garlic with the gluten-free breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, and chopped parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix everything together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>3. Stuffing the Mushrooms</h3>

    <p>Using a small spoon, fill each mushroom cap with the breadcrumb mixture, pressing down gently to ensure the stuffing is compact. Place the stuffed mushrooms on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or lightly greased with olive oil.</p>

    <h3>4. Baking the Mushrooms</h3>

    <p>Drizzle the stuffed mushrooms with the remaining olive oil. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender and the tops are golden brown. Keep an eye on them to prevent over-browning.</p>

    <h3>5. Serving</h3>

    <p>Once the mushrooms are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Serve warm as an appetizer or side dish. Garnish with additional chopped parsley if desired.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Stuffed Mushrooms</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While Parmesan cheese is a classic choice, you can experiment with other gluten-free cheeses like cheddar, mozzarella, or goat cheese. Each cheese will bring a unique flavor to the dish.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the stuffed mushrooms up to a day in advance. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator until you're ready to bake them. You may need to add a few extra minutes to the baking time if they're cold from the fridge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Are these mushrooms suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>To make this recipe vegan, simply substitute the Parmesan cheese with a vegan cheese alternative and ensure that your breadcrumbs are vegan-friendly. You can also add nutritional yeast for a cheesy flavor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free stuffed mushrooms?</h3>
        <p>While it's possible to freeze stuffed mushrooms, the texture of the mushrooms may change upon thawing. It's best to enjoy them fresh or store them in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.</p>
    </div>
