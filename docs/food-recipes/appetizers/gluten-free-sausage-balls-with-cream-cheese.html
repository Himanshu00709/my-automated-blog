    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C). This ensures that your sausage balls will cook evenly and achieve that perfect golden-brown color.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Combine the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free baking mix, ground sausage, cream cheese, shredded cheddar cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Use your hands or a stand mixer to thoroughly mix the ingredients until they are well combined. The mixture should be slightly sticky but easy to shape.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Sausage Balls</h3>
    <p>Using a tablespoon or a small cookie scoop, portion out the mixture and roll it into 1-inch balls. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving about an inch of space between each one to allow for even cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Bake the sausage balls in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. You can check for doneness by cutting one open to ensure there's no pink in the center.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the sausage balls are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before serving. They can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature, making them a versatile option for any occasion.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Sausage:</strong> The flavor of your sausage balls will largely depend on the quality of the sausage you use. Opt for a high-quality, gluten-free sausage for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can make the sausage balls tough. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Cheeses:</strong> While cheddar cheese is a classic choice, feel free to experiment with other types of cheese, such as pepper jack or mozzarella, for a different flavor profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> You can prepare the sausage balls ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator until you're ready to bake them. This makes them a convenient option for busy days.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I Freeze Gluten-Free Sausage Balls?</h3>

They can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply bake them in a preheated oven at 350째F (175째C) for 10-15 minutes, or until heated through.</p>

        <h3>Can I Use a Different Type of Meat?</h3>
