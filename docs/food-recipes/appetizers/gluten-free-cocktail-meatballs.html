    <p>When selecting your ingredients, always check labels to ensure they are certified gluten-free. Cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing, so it's essential to choose products that are explicitly labeled as gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Cocktail Meatballs</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients, let's dive into the process of making gluten-free cocktail meatballs. Follow these steps for a foolproof recipe:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Meatball Mixture</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine your ground meat, gluten-free breadcrumbs or almond flour, egg, and seasonings. Mix thoroughly until all ingredients are well incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough meatballs.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Shape the Meatballs</h3>

    <p>Using your hands or a small scoop, shape the mixture into bite-sized meatballs. Aim for uniformity in size to ensure even cooking. Place the shaped meatballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Meatballs</h3>

    <p>You can cook your meatballs in several ways: baking, frying, or using a slow cooker. Baking is the healthiest option and ensures even cooking. Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C) and bake the meatballs for 20-25 minutes, or until they reach an internal temperature of 165째F (74째C).</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Sauce</h3>

    <p>Once the meatballs are cooked, transfer them to a large bowl and toss them with your chosen gluten-free sauce. You can use BBQ sauce, teriyaki sauce, or even a homemade glaze. Ensure the meatballs are evenly coated, then return them to the oven for an additional 5-10 minutes to allow the sauce to caramelize slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Your gluten-free cocktail meatballs are now ready to serve! Arrange them on a platter with toothpicks for easy grabbing, and watch them disappear in no time.</p>
