    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Jalapeño Poppers</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free jalapeño poppers:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Jalapeños</h3>
    <p>Start by washing the jalapeños thoroughly. Cut them in half lengthwise and remove the seeds and membranes using a small spoon or knife. Be sure to wear gloves to protect your hands from the spicy oils.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, shredded cheddar, and your choice of seasonings. Mix until well combined. Spoon the cheese mixture into each jalapeño half, filling them generously.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Coat the Poppers</h3>
    <p>Prepare your coating station by setting up three shallow dishes: one with gluten-free flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with gluten-free breadcrumbs or almond flour. Dip each stuffed jalapeño into the flour, then the egg, and finally the breadcrumbs, ensuring they are fully coated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Poppers</h3>
    <p>You can cook the poppers in one of two ways: baking or frying. For a healthier option, bake them in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown. Alternatively, you can fry them in hot oil until crispy and golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once cooked, let the poppers cool slightly before serving. They pair wonderfully with a gluten-free dipping sauce, such as ranch or sour cream.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Jalapeño Poppers</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make jalapeño poppers ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the poppers up to the coating stage and store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before cooking. This makes them a great option for parties or gatherings.</p>
