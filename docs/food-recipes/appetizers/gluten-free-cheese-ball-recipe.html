    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free cheese ball:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Combine Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, shredded cheddar cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, and dried parsley. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Cheese Ball:</strong> Once the mixture is evenly combined, use your hands to shape it into a ball. If the mixture is too sticky, you can refrigerate it for 15-20 minutes to make it easier to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Coating:</strong> If desired, roll the cheese ball in chopped pecans or another gluten-free coating of your choice. This step is optional but adds a nice crunch and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill:</strong> Wrap the cheese ball in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld and the ball to firm up.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> When ready to serve, place the cheese ball on a platter and surround it with gluten-free crackers or fresh vegetables for dipping.</li>
