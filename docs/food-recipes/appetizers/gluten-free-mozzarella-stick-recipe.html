    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cheese Sticks</h3>
    <p>Start by cutting the mozzarella cheese into sticks, approximately 3 inches long and 1/2 inch thick. If you’re using pre-packaged mozzarella sticks, ensure they are gluten-free. Place the cheese sticks in the freezer for at least 30 minutes to firm them up. This step is crucial to prevent the cheese from melting too quickly during cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Set Up Your Breading Station</h3>
    <p>Prepare three shallow bowls for the breading process. In the first bowl, place the gluten-free all-purpose flour. In the second bowl, beat the eggs. In the third bowl, combine the gluten-free breadcrumbs, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix the breadcrumb mixture well to ensure even seasoning.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bread the Cheese Sticks</h3>
    <p>Remove the cheese sticks from the freezer. Dip each stick first into the flour, shaking off any excess. Next, dip it into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off. Finally, coat the stick evenly with the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to ensure the crumbs adhere well. Place the breaded sticks on a plate and return them to the freezer for another 15-20 minutes to set the coating.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Mozzarella Sticks</h3>
    <p>You can cook the mozzarella sticks by either frying or baking them. For frying, heat olive oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Fry the sticks in batches until golden brown, about 1-2 minutes per side. For baking, preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and place the sticks on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Lightly spray the sticks with cooking spray and bake for 8-10 minutes, turning halfway through, until golden and crispy.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once cooked, let the mozzarella sticks cool for a few minutes before serving. They pair perfectly with marinara sauce, ranch dressing, or your favorite dipping sauce. Enjoy them as a snack, appetizer, or party treat!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Mozzarella Sticks</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Freeze the Cheese:</strong> Freezing the cheese sticks before breading and cooking helps prevent them from melting too quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Double Coat:</strong> For extra crispiness, you can double coat the cheese sticks by repeating the egg and breadcrumb steps.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Panko Breadcrumbs:</strong> Gluten-free panko breadcrumbs can provide a lighter, crunchier texture compared to regular breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Cooking Time:</strong> Whether frying or baking, keep a close eye on the sticks to avoid overcooking and ensure the cheese stays gooey inside.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Mozzarella Sticks</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular mozzarella cheese?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular mozzarella cheese, but ensure that all other ingredients, such as breadcrumbs and flour, are gluten-free to keep the recipe safe for those with gluten intolerance.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the breaded mozzarella sticks and freeze them before cooking. When ready to serve, simply cook them directly from the freezer, adding a few extra minutes to the cooking time.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best oil for frying?</h3>
        <p>Olive oil, avocado oil, or vegetable oil are great options for frying. Choose an oil with a high smoke point to ensure even cooking.</p>

        <h3>Can I air fry these mozzarella sticks?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Preheat your air fryer to 400°F (200°C) and cook the sticks for 6-8 minutes, turning halfway through, until golden and crispy.</p>
    </div>
