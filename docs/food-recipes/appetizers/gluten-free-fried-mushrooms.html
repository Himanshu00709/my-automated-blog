<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Mushrooms</h3>
<p>Start by cleaning the mushrooms thoroughly. Use a damp cloth to wipe off any dirt, and remove the stems if desired. Pat them dry with a paper towel to ensure the coating adheres properly.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Create the Breading Station</h3>
<p>Set up three shallow bowls for the breading process. In the first bowl, place the gluten-free flour. In the second bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. In the third bowl, combine the gluten-free breadcrumbs with garlic powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Coat the Mushrooms</h3>
<p>Dip each mushroom first into the flour, shaking off any excess. Next, dip it into the egg mixture, ensuring it’s fully coated. Finally, roll it in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to adhere the crumbs.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Fry the Mushrooms</h3>
<p>Heat the oil in a deep skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the breaded mushrooms in batches, ensuring they don’t overcrowd the pan. Fry until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Serve the gluten-free fried mushrooms hot with your favorite dipping sauce, such as ranch, marinara, or a gluten-free aioli. They make a perfect appetizer, snack, or side dish.</p>
