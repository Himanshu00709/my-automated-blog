    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Cranberry Brie Bites?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference. Cranberry Brie Bites are a classic holiday appetizer, but traditional recipes often use puff pastry, which contains gluten. By substituting gluten-free ingredients, you can create a version that everyone can enjoy without sacrificing flavor or texture. The combination of creamy brie and tart cranberry sauce is a match made in heaven, and the gluten-free crust adds a satisfying crunch that complements the soft filling.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your pastry will bake evenly and achieve a golden, crispy texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Pastry</h3>
    <p>Roll out your gluten-free puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Using a round cookie cutter or a glass, cut out small circles that will fit into a mini muffin tin. Press each circle into the muffin tin, ensuring the edges are slightly higher than the center to hold the filling.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Filling</h3>
    <p>Place a small cube of brie into each pastry cup. Top with a teaspoon of cranberry sauce. For an extra touch of flavor, sprinkle a pinch of fresh thyme over the top.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake</h3>
    <p>Brush the edges of the pastry with olive oil or melted butter to help them brown. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and the brie is melted and bubbly.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the bites to cool slightly before removing them from the muffin tin. Serve warm, garnished with additional thyme if desired. These bites are best enjoyed fresh out of the oven!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Quality Ingredients:</strong> Since this recipe has few ingredients, using high-quality brie and cranberry sauce will make a big difference in flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overfill:</strong> Be careful not to overfill the pastry cups, as the brie will expand as it melts.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> Feel free to add other toppings like chopped nuts or a drizzle of honey for extra flavor and texture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cranberry Brie Bites</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the pastry cups and fill them with brie and cranberry sauce a few hours in advance. Keep them refrigerated until you’re ready to bake. However, for the best texture, it’s recommended to bake them just before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While brie is the classic choice, you can experiment with other soft cheeses like camembert or even goat cheese for a different flavor profile.</p>

        <h3>Are these bites suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe is not vegan as it contains dairy. However, you can substitute the brie with a vegan cheese alternative and use a vegan puff pastry to make it suitable for a vegan diet.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for 5-10 minutes to restore the crispiness of the pastry.</p>
