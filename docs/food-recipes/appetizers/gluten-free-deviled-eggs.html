<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Boil the Eggs</h3>

<p>Start by boiling the eggs. Place the eggs in a single layer in a saucepan and cover them with cold water. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let the eggs simmer for about 10 minutes. Once done, transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water to cool completely. This will make them easier to peel.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Egg Yolks</h3>

<p>Once the eggs are cooled, peel them and cut them in half lengthwise. Carefully remove the yolks and place them in a separate bowl. Mash the yolks with a fork until they are crumbly.</p>

<h3>3. Mix the Filling</h3>

<p>Add the gluten-free mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, white vinegar (if using), salt, and black pepper to the mashed yolks. Mix everything together until smooth and creamy. You can adjust the seasoning to your taste.</p>

<h3>4. Fill the Egg Whites</h3>

<p>Using a spoon or a piping bag, fill the egg white halves with the yolk mixture. If you want to get fancy, you can use a star-shaped piping tip to create a decorative swirl on top of each egg.</p>

<h3>5. Garnish and Serve</h3>

<p>Sprinkle the deviled eggs with paprika for a touch of color and flavor. You can also add other garnishes like chopped chives, parsley, or even a small piece of gluten-free bacon. Arrange the deviled eggs on a serving platter and refrigerate until ready to serve.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Deviled Eggs</h2>

<p>Deviled eggs are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. Eggs are an excellent source of high-quality protein, vitamins, and minerals. They contain essential nutrients like vitamin B12, vitamin D, and choline, which are important for brain health and overall well-being. By using gluten-free ingredients, you can enjoy this classic appetizer without worrying about gluten-related health issues.</p>
