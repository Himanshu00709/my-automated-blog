    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Spinach</h3>
    <p>Start by washing the fresh spinach thoroughly to remove any dirt or grit. Once cleaned, chop the spinach into smaller pieces. If you prefer a smoother dip, you can also use frozen spinach, but make sure to thaw and drain it well to avoid excess moisture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Base Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, sour cream, and mayonnaise. Stir until the mixture is smooth and well-combined. Add the minced garlic, grated Parmesan cheese, and shredded mozzarella cheese. Mix thoroughly to ensure all ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Spinach</h3>
    <p>Fold the chopped spinach into the creamy mixture. Make sure the spinach is evenly distributed throughout the dip. If you’re using gluten-free breadcrumbs, you can add them at this stage for a bit of texture. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Dip</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Transfer the spinach dip mixture into an oven-safe dish. If you’d like a golden, crispy top, sprinkle a little extra Parmesan cheese or gluten-free breadcrumbs on top. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the dip is bubbly and the top is lightly browned.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the dip from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Serve warm with gluten-free crackers, vegetable sticks, or gluten-free bread. This dip is perfect for sharing and is sure to be a hit at any gathering.</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use frozen spinach instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen spinach. Just make sure to thaw it completely and squeeze out any excess water to prevent the dip from becoming too watery.</p>

        <h3>2. What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free breadcrumbs, you can omit them entirely or use crushed gluten-free crackers for a similar texture.</p>

        <h3>3. How long can I store leftover spinach dip?</h3>
        <p>Leftover spinach dip can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make this dip dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the cream cheese, sour cream, and cheeses with dairy-free alternatives. Look for plant-based options that mimic the creamy texture of dairy products.</p>
