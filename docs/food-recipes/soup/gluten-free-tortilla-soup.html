<h1>Gluten-Free Tortilla Soup: A Flavorful and Healthy Delight</h1>

<p>When it comes to comfort food, few dishes can rival the warmth and satisfaction of a bowl of tortilla soup. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free version that doesn’t compromise on flavor can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free tortilla soup—a delicious, hearty, and nutritious dish that’s perfect for anyone looking to enjoy a classic favorite without the gluten. In this article, we’ll explore the origins of tortilla soup, the benefits of going gluten-free, and how to make your own gluten-free tortilla soup at home.</p>

<h2>The Origins of Tortilla Soup</h2>

<p>Tortilla soup, or <em>sopa de tortilla</em>, is a traditional Mexican dish that dates back centuries. It’s a flavorful blend of tomatoes, chilies, garlic, and onions, often garnished with crispy tortilla strips, avocado, cheese, and a squeeze of lime. The dish is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and has evolved over time, with each region adding its own unique twist. While the classic recipe is naturally gluten-free, some modern versions may include ingredients like flour-based thickeners or store-bought tortilla chips that contain gluten. That’s why it’s essential to be mindful of the ingredients when preparing or ordering tortilla soup.</p>

For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to fatigue and joint pain. A gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment for celiac disease, and many people without the condition also choose to avoid gluten for its potential health benefits, such as improved digestion and reduced inflammation. By opting for gluten-free tortilla soup, you can enjoy a delicious meal without worrying about adverse effects.</p>

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Tortilla Soup</h2>
