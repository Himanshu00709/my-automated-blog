    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Italian Wedding Soup</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free Italian Wedding Soup is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating this comforting dish:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Meatballs</h3>
    <p>Start by making the meatballs. Combine ground meat (chicken, turkey, or beef) with gluten-free breadcrumbs or almond flour, an egg, minced garlic, grated Parmesan cheese, and seasonings like salt, pepper, and Italian herbs. Mix well and form into small meatballs, about 1 inch in diameter.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Meatballs</h3>
    <p>In a large pot, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add the meatballs and cook until they are browned on all sides. Remove the meatballs from the pot and set them aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Soup Base</h3>
    <p>In the same pot, add diced onions, carrots, and celery. Sauté until the vegetables are softened. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute. Pour in gluten-free chicken or beef broth and bring the mixture to a simmer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Greens and Meatballs</h3>
    <p>Once the broth is simmering, add the meatballs back into the pot along with your choice of greens, such as escarole or spinach. Let the soup simmer until the greens are wilted and the meatballs are cooked through.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Gluten-Free Pasta</h3>
    <p>If you’re using gluten-free pasta, cook it separately according to the package instructions and add it to the soup just before serving. Alternatively, you can use cooked rice as a gluten-free alternative to pasta.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of fresh parsley. Serve hot and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Italian Wedding Soup</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make Italian Wedding Soup ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make Italian Wedding Soup ahead of time. However, it’s best to add the gluten-free pasta or rice just before serving to prevent it from becoming too soft. The soup can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs in the meatballs?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free breadcrumbs, you can use almond flour, crushed gluten-free crackers, or even cooked quinoa as a substitute in the meatballs.</p>

        <h3>Is Italian Wedding Soup healthy?</h3>
        <p>Italian Wedding Soup is generally considered a healthy dish, especially when made with lean meats and plenty of vegetables. The gluten-free version is just as nutritious, provided you use high-quality, gluten-free ingredients.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze Italian Wedding Soup?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze Italian Wedding Soup. However, it’s best to freeze the soup without the pasta or rice, as these can become mushy when thawed. Add the gluten-free pasta or rice when reheating the soup.</p>
