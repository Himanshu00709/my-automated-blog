    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free slow cooker potato soup is incredibly easy. Follow these steps for a perfect bowl of comfort:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> Peel and dice the potatoes, chop the onion, and mince the garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Aromatics:</strong> In a skillet, heat the butter or olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, sautéing until they become translucent and fragrant.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine in the Slow Cooker:</strong> Transfer the sautéed onions and garlic to the slow cooker. Add the diced potatoes and gluten-free broth. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook on Low:</strong> Set your slow cooker to low and let the soup cook for 6-8 hours. The potatoes should become tender and easily mashed with a fork.</li>
        <li><strong>Blend for Creaminess:</strong> Once the potatoes are cooked, use an immersion blender to partially blend the soup. This will create a creamy texture while leaving some chunks for added texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Cream and Season:</strong> Stir in the heavy cream or coconut milk. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Ladle the soup into bowls and top with your favorite toppings, such as shredded cheese, chives, or bacon bits.</li>
    </ol>
