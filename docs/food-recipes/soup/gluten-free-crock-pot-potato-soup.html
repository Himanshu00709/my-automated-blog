    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by peeling and dicing the potatoes into bite-sized pieces. Finely chop the onion and mince the garlic. Having all your ingredients prepped and ready will make the cooking process smoother.</p>

    <h3>2. Sauté the Aromatics</h3>
    <p>In a skillet, heat the butter or olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. This step enhances the flavor base of your soup.</p>

    <h3>3. Combine Ingredients in the Crock Pot</h3>
    <p>Transfer the sautéed onions and garlic to your crock pot. Add the diced potatoes and gluten-free broth. Stir to combine, ensuring the potatoes are well-coated with the broth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>4. Cook on Low Heat</h3>
    <p>Set your crock pot to low heat and let the soup cook for 6-8 hours. The long, slow cooking process allows the potatoes to become tender and the flavors to meld together beautifully.</p>

    <h3>5. Blend for Creaminess</h3>
    <p>Once the potatoes are soft, use an immersion blender to partially blend the soup, leaving some chunks for texture. Alternatively, you can transfer a portion of the soup to a blender, blend until smooth, and then return it to the crock pot.</p>

    <h3>6. Add Cream and Serve</h3>
    <p>Stir in the heavy cream or coconut milk to add richness to the soup. Let it heat through for another 10-15 minutes. Serve hot, garnished with your favorite toppings like shredded cheese, chives, or bacon bits.</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this soup dairy-free?</h3>

    <div class="faq">

    </div>

    <div class="faq">

        <p>Certainly! Carrots, celery, or even cauliflower can be added for extra flavor and nutrition. Just make sure to adjust the cooking time if needed.</p>
