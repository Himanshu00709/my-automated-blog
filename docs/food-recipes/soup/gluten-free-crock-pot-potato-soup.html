    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free crock pot potato soup is incredibly simple. Follow these steps for a delicious result:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> Peel and dice the potatoes into small cubes. Finely chop the onion and mince the garlic cloves.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Aromatics:</strong> In a skillet, heat the butter or olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until they become translucent and fragrant.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine in the Crock Pot:</strong> Transfer the sautéed onions and garlic to the crock pot. Add the diced potatoes and gluten-free broth. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook on Low:</strong> Set your crock pot to low and let the soup cook for 6-8 hours. The potatoes should become tender and easily mashable.</li>
        <li><strong>Blend for Creaminess:</strong> Once the potatoes are cooked, use an immersion blender to partially blend the soup. This will create a creamy texture while leaving some chunks of potato for added texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Cream:</strong> Stir in the heavy cream or coconut milk. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Ladle the soup into bowls and top with your favorite toppings, such as shredded cheese, chives, or bacon bits.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>One of the best things about this gluten-free crock pot potato soup is how versatile it is. Here are some ideas for customizing your soup:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Add Vegetables:</strong> Consider adding carrots, celery, or leeks for extra flavor and nutrition.</li>
        <li><strong>Spice It Up:</strong> Add a pinch of cayenne pepper or smoked paprika for a bit of heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Make It Vegan:</strong> Use vegetable broth and coconut milk instead of chicken broth and heavy cream.</li>
        <li><strong>Protein Boost:</strong> Add cooked chicken or turkey for a heartier meal.</li>
    </ul>
