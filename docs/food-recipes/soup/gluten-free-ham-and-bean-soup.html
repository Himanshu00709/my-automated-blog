<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Beans</h3>
<p>Start by soaking the dried white beans overnight in a large bowl of water. This will help soften the beans and reduce cooking time. Drain and rinse the beans before using them in the soup.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
<p>In a large pot, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions, carrots, and celery, and sauté until the vegetables are tender, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, stirring frequently to prevent burning.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add the Ham and Beans</h3>
<p>Cut the gluten-free ham into bite-sized pieces and add them to the pot. Stir in the soaked and drained beans, ensuring they are well-coated with the sautéed vegetables.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Pour in the Broth and Seasonings</h3>
<p>Add the gluten-free chicken broth to the pot, along with the bay leaves and thyme. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the beans are tender.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Season and Serve</h3>
<p>Once the beans are cooked, remove the bay leaves and season the soup with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley if desired.</p>
