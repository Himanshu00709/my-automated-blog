    <h2>Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the cooking process. Follow these simple steps to create a delicious gluten-free turkey soup:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onions, carrots, and celery, and sauté until they begin to soften, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, stirring frequently to prevent burning.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Broth and Seasonings</h3>
    <p>Pour in the gluten-free chicken or turkey broth, and add the fresh thyme and bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Incorporate the Turkey and Pasta</h3>
    <p>Add the shredded turkey to the pot and stir to combine. If you're using gluten-free rice or quinoa pasta, add it at this stage as well. Let the soup simmer for another 10-15 minutes, or until the pasta is cooked through and the vegetables are tender.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Season and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the soup is ready, remove the bay leaf and season with salt and pepper to taste. Ladle the soup into bowls and serve hot. You can garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese if desired.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Turkey Soup</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free turkey soup is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Turkey is a lean source of protein, which is essential for muscle repair and growth. The vegetables provide a wealth of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin A from the carrots and vitamin C from the celery. The gluten-free pasta adds a source of complex carbohydrates, making this soup a well-rounded meal that will keep you satisfied and energized.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Turkey Soup</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh turkey instead of cooked turkey?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh turkey if you prefer. Simply cook the turkey in the pot before adding the vegetables, or use pre-cooked turkey for convenience.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this soup?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This soup freezes well. Allow it to cool completely before transferring it to airtight containers. It can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. When ready to eat, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and reheat on the stove.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free pasta?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use gluten-free pasta, you can substitute it with cooked rice, quinoa, or even gluten-free noodles like zucchini noodles (zoodles).</p>

        <h3>Is this soup suitable for a low-carb diet?</h3>
        <p>While this soup is gluten-free, it does contain carbohydrates from the vegetables and pasta. If you're following a low-carb diet, you can omit the pasta and increase the amount of turkey and vegetables.</p>
