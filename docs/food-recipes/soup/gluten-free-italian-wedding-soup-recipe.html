    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Meatballs</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground turkey or chicken, gluten-free breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, egg, minced garlic, and chopped parsley. Mix until well combined. Roll the mixture into small, bite-sized meatballs (about 1 inch in diameter). Set aside.</p>

    <h3>2. Cook the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the diced carrots and celery, and sauté for about 5 minutes until they begin to soften. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>3. Add the Broth</h3>
    <p>Pour the chicken broth into the pot and bring it to a gentle boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer.</p>

    <h3>4. Cook the Meatballs</h3>
    <p>Carefully drop the meatballs into the simmering broth. Let them cook for about 10-12 minutes, or until they are fully cooked through.</p>

    <h3>5. Add the Greens and Pasta</h3>
    <p>Stir in the fresh spinach and gluten-free orzo or rice. Cook for an additional 8-10 minutes, or until the pasta is tender and the spinach is wilted.</p>

    <h3>6. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh parsley if desired. Serve hot and enjoy!</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Can I use beef instead of turkey or chicken?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute ground beef for the turkey or chicken. However, keep in mind that beef has a stronger flavor and higher fat content, which may alter the taste and nutritional profile of the soup.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free orzo?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free orzo, you can use rice, quinoa, or even gluten-free pasta shapes like small shells or elbows.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this soup ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This soup stores well in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Simply reheat it on the stove or in the microwave before serving. If you plan to freeze it, omit the pasta and add it fresh when reheating to prevent it from becoming mushy.</p>

        <h3>Is this soup suitable for vegetarians?</h3>
        <p>This recipe includes meat, but you can make a vegetarian version by using plant-based meatballs and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.</p>
