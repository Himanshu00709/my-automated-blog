    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free cheddar cheese soup:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Roux</h3>
    <p>In a large pot, melt the gluten-free butter over medium heat. Once melted, gradually whisk in the gluten-free flour until a smooth paste forms. This roux will serve as the thickening agent for your soup.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Broth</h3>
    <p>Slowly pour in the gluten-free chicken or vegetable broth, whisking continuously to prevent lumps. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, allowing it to thicken slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Incorporate the Cheese</h3>
    <p>Reduce the heat to low and gradually add the shredded cheddar cheese, stirring until the cheese is fully melted and the soup is smooth. Be sure to use a high-quality cheddar cheese for the best flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Milk or Cream</h3>
    <p>Pour in the gluten-free milk or cream, stirring to combine. This will add a rich, creamy texture to the soup. Season with salt, pepper, and any additional gluten-free seasonings you prefer.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the soup is heated through and well-combined, it’s ready to serve. Garnish with fresh herbs, crumbled gluten-free crackers, or a sprinkle of extra cheese for added flavor and texture.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cheddar Cheese Soup</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free cheddar cheese soup turns out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Cheese:</strong> The quality of the cheddar cheese you use will greatly impact the flavor of your soup. Opt for a sharp or extra-sharp cheddar for a more robust taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk Continuously:</strong> When adding the flour and broth, whisk continuously to prevent lumps from forming. A smooth soup is key to a great texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Consistency:</strong> If your soup is too thick, you can thin it out with additional broth or milk. Conversely, if it’s too thin, let it simmer a bit longer to reduce and thicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to customize your soup with add-ins like cooked bacon, diced vegetables, or gluten-free croutons for added flavor and texture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use pre-shredded cheese?</h3>
        <p>While pre-shredded cheese is convenient, it often contains anti-caking agents that can affect the texture of your soup. For the best results, shred your own cheese from a block.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this soup dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a dairy-free version of this soup by using dairy-free butter, cheese, and milk alternatives. However, keep in mind that the flavor and texture may differ slightly from the traditional recipe.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover soup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop, adding a splash of broth or milk if needed to restore the soup’s consistency.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this soup?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze gluten-free cheddar cheese soup. Allow it to cool completely before transferring it to a freezer-safe container. It can be stored in the freezer for up to 2 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and reheat gently on the stovetop.</p>
