    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Matzo Balls</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and then add the gluten-free matzo meal, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the mixture to firm up.</p>

    <h3>2. Form the Matzo Balls</h3>
    <p>Once the mixture has chilled, wet your hands and form the dough into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Be careful not to overwork the dough, as this can make the matzo balls dense.</p>

    <h3>3. Cook the Matzo Balls</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Gently drop the matzo balls into the boiling water and reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover the pot and let the matzo balls cook for about 20-25 minutes, or until they are light and fluffy.</p>

    <h3>4. Prepare the Soup Base</h3>
    <p>While the matzo balls are cooking, heat the olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion, sliced carrots, and celery. Sauté until the vegetables are tender, about 8-10 minutes. Pour in the chicken broth and bring the mixture to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat and let the soup simmer for 15 minutes.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the matzo balls are cooked, carefully remove them from the water using a slotted spoon and add them to the soup. Stir in the fresh dill and season with additional salt and pepper if needed. Serve hot and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Matzo Balls</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Refrigerating the dough helps the matzo balls hold their shape and prevents them from falling apart during cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can result in dense matzo balls. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh eggs and gluten-free matzo meal will yield the best results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make the matzo balls ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the matzo balls ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before cooking. Alternatively, you can freeze the uncooked matzo balls for up to a month.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free matzo meal?</h3>
        <p>If you can't find gluten-free matzo meal, you can make your own by grinding gluten-free crackers or bread in a food processor until they reach a fine, meal-like consistency.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this soup vegetarian?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the chicken broth with vegetable broth and use a plant-based egg substitute for the matzo balls.</p>
