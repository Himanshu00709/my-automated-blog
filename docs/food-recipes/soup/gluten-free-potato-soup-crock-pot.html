    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free potato soup in a crock pot:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Potatoes:</strong> Peel and dice the potatoes into bite-sized pieces. This will ensure they cook evenly and become tender in the soup.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Aromatics:</strong> In a skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, sautéing until they become fragrant and translucent.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Roux:</strong> In the same skillet, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and the gluten-free flour. Stir continuously to create a roux, which will help thicken the soup.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Ingredients in the Crock Pot:</strong> Transfer the sautéed onions, garlic, and roux to the crock pot. Add the diced potatoes, gluten-free chicken broth, salt, and black pepper. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook on Low:</strong> Set your crock pot to low and let the soup cook for 6-8 hours. This slow cooking process will allow the flavors to meld together and the potatoes to become tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Cream and Cheese:</strong> About 30 minutes before serving, stir in the heavy cream and shredded cheddar cheese. This will give the soup its creamy, rich texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Once the soup is ready, ladle it into bowls and garnish with chopped green onions and crumbled bacon. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Potato Soup</h2>
    <p>Here are some additional tips to ensure your gluten-free potato soup turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Potatoes:</strong> Russet potatoes are ideal for this recipe because they break down easily, creating a creamy texture. However, Yukon Gold potatoes also work well if you prefer a slightly firmer bite.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Your Broth:</strong> Always double-check that your chicken broth is gluten-free. Some brands may contain hidden gluten, so it’s essential to read the labels carefully.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the Thickness:</strong> If you prefer a thicker soup, you can add more gluten-free flour to the roux. Conversely, if you like a thinner soup, simply add more broth or cream.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize Your Toppings:</strong> Feel free to get creative with your toppings. Sour cream, chives, or even a dollop of Greek yogurt can add an extra layer of flavor to your soup.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this soup dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this soup dairy-free by substituting the heavy cream with a non-dairy alternative like coconut milk or almond milk. You can also use dairy-free cheese or omit the cheese altogether.</p>
