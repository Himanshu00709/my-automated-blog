    <h1>Gluten-Free Tortilla Soup: A Flavorful and Healthy Delight</h1>

    <p>When it comes to comfort food, few dishes can rival the warmth and satisfaction of a bowl of tortilla soup. But for those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding a version of this classic dish that meets dietary restrictions can be a challenge. Fortunately, gluten-free tortilla soup is not only possible but also incredibly delicious and nutritious. In this article, we’ll explore the origins of tortilla soup, its health benefits, and how to make a gluten-free version that will delight your taste buds.</p>

    <h2>The Origins of Tortilla Soup</h2>

    <p>Tortilla soup, or "sopa de tortilla," is a traditional Mexican dish that dates back centuries. It is believed to have originated in the central and southern regions of Mexico, where corn tortillas are a staple food. The soup typically consists of a rich tomato-based broth, shredded chicken, and crispy tortilla strips, garnished with avocado, cheese, and lime. Over time, the dish has evolved, with various regions adding their own unique twists, such as different spices, vegetables, or proteins.</p>

    <p>Despite its humble beginnings, tortilla soup has gained international popularity, thanks to its bold flavors and versatility. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional recipes can be problematic due to the use of wheat-based tortillas or other gluten-containing ingredients. This is where gluten-free tortilla soup comes in, offering a safe and equally delicious alternative.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Tortilla Soup</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free tortilla soup at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a simple recipe that you can customize to suit your taste:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 jalapeño, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken or vegetable broth (ensure it’s gluten-free)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked, shredded chicken (optional)</li>
        <li>4 corn tortillas, cut into strips</li>
        <li>1 avocado, diced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>1 lime, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and jalapeño, and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the diced tomatoes, broth, cumin, and chili powder. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the soup is simmering, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread the tortilla strips on a baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until crispy.</li>
        <li>Add the shredded chicken to the soup (if using) and let it heat through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and top with the crispy tortilla strips, diced avocado, and fresh cilantro. Serve with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over the soup.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This recipe is highly customizable, so feel free to add other ingredients like black beans, corn, or bell peppers. The key is to ensure that all ingredients are gluten-free, especially the broth and tortillas.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Tortilla Soup</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I make tortilla soup without chicken?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can easily make a vegetarian or vegan version of tortilla soup by omitting the chicken and using vegetable broth instead. You can also add plant-based proteins like tofu or tempeh for extra texture and flavor.</p>

        <h3>2. Are store-bought tortilla strips gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Not all store-bought tortilla strips are gluten-free, so it’s important to check the label. Look for brands that specifically state they are gluten-free, or make your own by baking corn tortillas as described in the recipe.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I freeze gluten-free tortilla soup?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze gluten-free tortilla soup for up to 3 months. However, it’s best to freeze the soup without the tortilla strips, avocado, and cilantro, as these ingredients don’t freeze well. Add them fresh when you’re ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>4. What can I use instead of corn tortillas?</h3>
        <p>If you can’t find corn tortillas or prefer a different texture, you can use gluten-free rice tortillas or even gluten-free crackers as a substitute. Just make sure they are certified gluten-free to avoid any cross-contamination.</p>
