    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Taco Soup</h2>
    <p>Now that you know the key ingredients, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free taco soup:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by gathering all your ingredients. Chop the onion, garlic, and bell peppers, and rinse the black beans and corn if using canned varieties. If you’re using ground beef or turkey, make sure it’s thawed and ready to cook.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Meat</h3>
    <p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, cook the ground beef or turkey over medium heat until it’s browned and cooked through. Drain any excess fat, then add the chopped onion and garlic. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the onion is translucent.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Vegetables and Seasoning</h3>
    <p>Next, add the diced tomatoes, black beans, corn, and bell peppers to the pot. Stir in the gluten-free taco seasoning, making sure everything is well-coated. Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, and bring the mixture to a boil.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Simmer and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the soup reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 20-30 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld together. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. Serve the soup hot, garnished with your favorite toppings like avocado, shredded cheese, cilantro, or a squeeze of lime juice.</p>
