    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by peeling and dicing the potatoes into bite-sized pieces. Chop the onion and mince the garlic. These ingredients will form the base of your soup, so take care to prepare them properly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Aromatics</h3>
    <p>In a skillet, heat the butter or olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until the onion is translucent and fragrant. This step helps to build the flavor base of the soup.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Ingredients in the Slow Cooker</h3>
    <p>Transfer the sautéed onions and garlic to the slow cooker. Add the diced potatoes and gluten-free broth. Stir to combine, then season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook on Low Heat</h3>
    <p>Set your slow cooker to low heat and let the soup cook for 6-8 hours. The long cooking time allows the potatoes to become tender and the flavors to meld together beautifully.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add Cream and Blend</h3>
    <p>Once the soup is cooked, stir in the heavy cream or coconut milk. For a smoother texture, you can use an immersion blender to partially blend the soup, leaving some chunks of potato for texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Ladle the soup into bowls and top with your favorite toppings, such as shredded cheese, chives, or bacon bits. Serve hot and enjoy the comforting warmth of your gluten-free potato soup.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this soup ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free potato soup can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove or in the microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of heavy cream?</h3>
