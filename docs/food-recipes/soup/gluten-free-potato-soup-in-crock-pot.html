    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free potato soup in a crock pot:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> Peel and dice the potatoes into bite-sized pieces. Chop the onion and mince the garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Aromatics:</strong> In a skillet, heat the butter or olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, sautéing until they become fragrant and translucent.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine in the Crock Pot:</strong> Transfer the sautéed onions and garlic to the crock pot. Add the diced potatoes, broth, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook on Low:</strong> Set your crock pot to low heat and let the soup cook for 6-8 hours. This slow cooking process allows the potatoes to become tender and the flavors to develop fully.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Cream:</strong> About 30 minutes before serving, stir in the heavy cream or coconut milk. This will give the soup its creamy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Blend (Optional):</strong> For a smoother soup, use an immersion blender to partially blend the soup, leaving some chunks of potato for texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh parsley, shredded cheese, bacon bits, or chives as desired.</li>
