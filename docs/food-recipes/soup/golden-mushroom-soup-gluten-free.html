<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Golden Mushroom Soup</h2>

<p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free golden mushroom soup:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Mushrooms</h3>
<p>Start by cleaning and slicing your mushrooms. You can use a variety of mushrooms such as cremini, button, or shiitake for a more complex flavor. Sauté the mushrooms in a large pot with a bit of olive oil or butter until they are golden brown and have released their moisture.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Create the Roux</h3>
<p>In a separate pan, melt some butter and whisk in your gluten-free flour. Cook the mixture for a few minutes until it becomes a smooth paste. This roux will help thicken the soup and give it a creamy texture.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine Ingredients</h3>
<p>Add the roux to the pot with the sautéed mushrooms. Gradually pour in your gluten-free broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Cream and Seasonings</h3>
<p>Once the soup has thickened, stir in the cream and your chosen seasonings. Common seasonings for golden mushroom soup include garlic powder, thyme, salt, and pepper. Adjust the seasoning to taste.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or chives. Serve hot with a side of gluten-free bread or crackers for a complete meal.</p>
