    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Minestrone</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the right pasta:</strong> Not all gluten-free pastas are created equal. Look for brands that hold their shape well during cooking, such as those made from brown rice or quinoa.</li>
        <li><strong>Add more vegetables:</strong> Feel free to customize the soup with your favorite vegetables, such as spinach, kale, or bell peppers.</li>
        <li><strong>Make it ahead:</strong> This soup tastes even better the next day, as the flavors have more time to meld together. Store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free minestrone soup?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze this soup for up to 3 months. However, it’s best to freeze it without the pasta, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy when reheated. Add freshly cooked pasta when you’re ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>Can I use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Chicken broth can be used as a substitute for vegetable broth if you prefer a non-vegetarian version of the soup.</p>

        <h3>What other beans can I use?</h3>
        <p>You can use any beans you like, such as cannellini beans, chickpeas, or black beans. Each type of bean will add a slightly different flavor and texture to the soup.</p>
