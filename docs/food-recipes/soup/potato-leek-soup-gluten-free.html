<p>Potato leek soup, also known as "vichyssoise" when served cold, has its roots in French cuisine.

Over time, the soup gained popularity and became a staple in both French and American cuisine.</p>

<p>Now that we've covered the history and health benefits, let's dive into the recipe. This gluten-free potato leek soup is easy to make and requires just a few simple ingredients. Here's what you'll need:</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
    <li>3 leeks, cleaned and sliced (white and light green parts only)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter or olive oil</li>
    <li>4 cups gluten-free chicken or vegetable stock</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy cream or coconut milk (for a dairy-free option)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Optional: Fresh chives or parsley for garnish</li>
</ul>

    <li>Add the diced potatoes to the pot and stir to combine with the leeks. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Pour in the gluten-free chicken or vegetable stock, ensuring that the potatoes are fully submerged. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.</li>

    <li>Return the pureed soup to the pot and stir in the heavy cream or coconut milk. Heat the soup gently until it is warmed through, but do not let it boil.</li>
