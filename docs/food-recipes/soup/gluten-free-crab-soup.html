    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free crab soup:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Base:</strong> In a large pot, melt the butter or heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, celery, and garlic, and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Flour:</strong> Sprinkle the gluten-free flour over the sautéed vegetables and stir to combine. Cook for 1-2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour in the Broth:</strong> Gradually add the chicken or vegetable broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the Soup:</strong> Add the Old Bay seasoning, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Crab Meat:</strong> Gently fold in the crab meat, being careful not to break up the lumps too much. Simmer for another 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish with Cream:</strong> Stir in the heavy cream or coconut milk and heat through. Be careful not to boil the soup once the cream has been added.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh parsley if desired. Serve hot with gluten-free crackers or crusty bread.</li>
    </ol>
