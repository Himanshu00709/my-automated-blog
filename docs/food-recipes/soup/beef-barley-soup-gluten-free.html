    <h1>Gluten-Free Beef Barley Soup: A Hearty and Healthy Comfort Food</h1>
    <p>When it comes to comfort food, few dishes can rival the warmth and satisfaction of a bowl of beef barley soup. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional beef barley soup can be off-limits due to the gluten content in barley.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create a flavorful gluten-free beef barley soup:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Brown the Beef:</strong> In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the beef stew meat and brown it on all sides. This step helps to develop a rich flavor in the soup.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Vegetables:</strong> Add the diced onion, sliced carrots, and celery to the pot. Cook until the vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Broth and Seasonings:</strong> Pour in the gluten-free beef broth and add the bay leaves and thyme. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the beef is tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Gluten-Free Grain:</strong> While the soup is simmering, cook your chosen gluten-free grain (quinoa, rice, or millet) according to the package instructions. Once cooked, set it aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine and Serve:</strong> Once the beef is tender, remove the bay leaves from the soup. Stir in the cooked gluten-free grain and season the soup with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
