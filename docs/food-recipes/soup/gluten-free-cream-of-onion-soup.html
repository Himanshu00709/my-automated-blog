    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create a delicious gluten-free cream of onion soup:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Caramelize the Onions:</strong> In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until they become golden brown and caramelized. This process can take about 30-40 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Gluten-Free Flour:</strong> Sprinkle the gluten-free flour over the caramelized onions and stir well to combine. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate the Broth:</strong> Gradually add the chicken or vegetable broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the Soup:</strong> Add the salt, black pepper, fresh thyme, and bay leaf. Allow the soup to simmer for about 20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Cream:</strong> Stir in the heavy cream or coconut cream and heat the soup through without boiling. Remove the bay leaf before serving.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh thyme or a drizzle of cream, if desired. Serve hot with gluten-free bread or crackers.</li>
    </ol>
