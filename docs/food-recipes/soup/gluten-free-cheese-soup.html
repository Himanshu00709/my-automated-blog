    <p>Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s dive into a simple yet delicious recipe for gluten-free cheese soup. This recipe serves four and can be easily customized to suit your taste preferences.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons gluten-free flour (such as rice flour or almond flour)</li>
        <li>4 cups gluten-free chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream or coconut milk (for a dairy-free option)</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded gluten-free cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a blend)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup diced carrots</li>
        <li>1 cup diced celery</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter or olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
