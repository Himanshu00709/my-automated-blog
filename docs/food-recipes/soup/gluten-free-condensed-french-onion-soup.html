    <h1>Gluten-Free Condensed French Onion Soup: A Culinary Delight</h1>

    <p>French Onion Soup is a classic dish that has been enjoyed for centuries. Its rich, savory flavor and comforting warmth make it a favorite during the colder months. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying traditional French Onion Soup can be a challenge due to the use of flour as a thickening agent.

In this article, we'll explore the history of French Onion Soup, the benefits of going gluten-free, and how to make your own gluten-free condensed version at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of French Onion Soup</h2>

    <p>French Onion Soup has its roots in ancient Rome, where onions were a staple food. However, the modern version of the soup is believed to have originated in France during the 18th century. The dish gained popularity in the United States in the 1960s and has since become a beloved comfort food. Traditionally, French Onion Soup is made with caramelized onions, beef broth, and a splash of wine, topped with a slice of toasted bread and melted cheese. The soup is then baked until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of health issues, including digestive problems, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. Going gluten-free is not just a dietary choice; for many, it's a necessity. Fortunately, with the rise of gluten-free products and recipes, it's easier than ever to enjoy your favorite dishes without the worry of gluten.</p>

    <h2>Making Gluten-Free Condensed French Onion Soup</h2>

    <p>Creating a gluten-free version of condensed French Onion Soup is simpler than you might think. The key is to replace the traditional flour thickener with a gluten-free alternative, such as cornstarch or a gluten-free flour blend. Below is a step-by-step guide to making your own gluten-free condensed French Onion Soup at home.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Caramelize the Onions:</strong> In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are deeply caramelized and golden brown. This process can take about 30-40 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Deglaze the Pot:</strong> If using wine, add it to the pot and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom. Allow the wine to reduce by half.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Broth and Seasonings:</strong> Pour in the beef broth, and add the thyme, bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Thicken the Soup:</strong> In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with a few tablespoons of cold water to create a slurry. Slowly stir the slurry into the soup and continue to cook until the soup thickens, about 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Remove the Bay Leaf:</strong> Before serving, make sure to remove the bay leaf from the soup.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve or Store:</strong> Your gluten-free condensed French Onion Soup is now ready to be used in recipes or enjoyed as is. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.</li>
    </ol>
