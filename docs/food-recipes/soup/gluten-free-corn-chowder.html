    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free corn chowder:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In a large pot, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat. Add the diced onions, celery, and carrots (if using) and sauté until the vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Potatoes and Corn</h3>
    <p>Add the diced potatoes and corn kernels to the pot. Stir to combine with the sautéed vegetables. Cook for another 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Sprinkle the Gluten-Free Flour</h3>
    <p>Sprinkle the gluten-free flour blend over the vegetables and stir well to coat. This will help thicken the chowder as it cooks. Cook for 1-2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Broth</h3>
    <p>Slowly pour in the gluten-free chicken or vegetable broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Cream and Seasonings</h3>
    <p>Once the potatoes are cooked, stir in the heavy cream or coconut milk. Season the chowder with salt, pepper, and any fresh herbs you’re using. Let the chowder simmer for another 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Ladle the gluten-free corn chowder into bowls and garnish with additional fresh herbs if desired. Serve hot and enjoy the comforting, creamy goodness of your homemade gluten-free corn chowder!</p>
