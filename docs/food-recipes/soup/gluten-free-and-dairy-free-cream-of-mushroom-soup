    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free and dairy-free cream of mushroom soup:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Vegetables:</strong> Heat the olive oil or coconut oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Mushrooms:</strong> Add the sliced mushrooms to the pot and cook until they release their moisture and become tender, about 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Flour:</strong> Sprinkle the gluten-free flour over the mushrooms and stir to coat. Cook for 1-2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour in the Broth:</strong> Gradually add the vegetable broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Coconut Milk:</strong> Stir in the coconut milk and thyme. Simmer the soup for another 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li><strong>Season and Serve:</strong> Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.</li>
    </ol>
