    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these steps to create a delicious dairy-free gluten-free cream of chicken soup:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Vegetables:</strong> Heat the olive oil or coconut oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, garlic, carrots, and celery. Sauté until the vegetables are tender, about 5-7 minutes.</li>

        <li><strong>Incorporate the Milk:</strong> Add the almond milk or coconut milk to the pot and stir well. Allow the soup to simmer for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Chicken:</strong> Stir in the cooked and shredded chicken breast. Season with salt, pepper, and fresh herbs if desired. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes to heat through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with additional herbs if desired. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
