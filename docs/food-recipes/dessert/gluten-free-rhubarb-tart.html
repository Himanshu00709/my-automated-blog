    <h1>Gluten-Free Rhubarb Tart: A Delightful Dessert for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Rhubarb, with its tangy flavor and vibrant color, is a springtime favorite that can be transformed into a variety of delicious desserts. One such dessert is the gluten-free rhubarb tart, a treat that combines the tartness of rhubarb with the sweetness of a gluten-free crust. Whether you're gluten-intolerant or simply looking for a healthier dessert option, this rhubarb tart is sure to impress. In this article, we'll explore the benefits of gluten-free baking, provide a step-by-step recipe, and answer some frequently asked questions about this delightful dessert.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Baking?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has gained popularity in recent years, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among health-conscious individuals. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues for some people. By opting for gluten-free alternatives, you can enjoy your favorite desserts without the discomfort. Additionally, gluten-free flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour offer unique flavors and textures that can enhance your baking creations.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Rhubarb Tart</h2>
    <p>Before diving into the recipe, let's take a look at the ingredients you'll need to make a gluten-free rhubarb tart. The ingredients are divided into two parts: the crust and the filling.</p>

    <h3>For the Crust:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups almond flour</li>
        <li>½ cup tapioca flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup coconut sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter (or coconut oil for a dairy-free option)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups fresh rhubarb, chopped into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>½ cup coconut sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tapioca flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all the ingredients, let's walk through the steps to create this delicious gluten-free rhubarb tart.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, tapioca flour, coconut sugar, and salt. Add the cold butter (or coconut oil) and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Add the egg and mix until the dough comes together. Press the dough into a 9-inch tart pan, making sure to evenly cover the bottom and sides. Chill the crust in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, toss the chopped rhubarb with coconut sugar, tapioca flour, vanilla extract, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Let the mixture sit for about 15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the rhubarb to release some of its juices.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Remove the chilled crust from the refrigerator and pour the rhubarb filling into the crust, spreading it evenly. Bake the tart in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Allow the tart to cool completely before serving.</p>
