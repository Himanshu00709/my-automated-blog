    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Coffee Mixture</h3>
    <p>Brew a cup of strong coffee and let it cool to room temperature. You can add a splash of almond milk or a dairy-free creamer if you prefer a milder coffee flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Whip the Coconut Cream</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whip the chilled coconut cream until it becomes light and fluffy. Add the maple syrup (or agave) and vanilla extract, and continue to whip until well combined. This will serve as your dairy-free mascarpone substitute.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Layers</h3>
    <p>Dip each gluten-free ladyfinger into the cooled coffee mixture, ensuring they are moist but not soggy. Arrange a layer of soaked ladyfingers at the bottom of your serving dish. Spread a generous layer of the whipped coconut cream over the ladyfingers. Repeat the process to create multiple layers, finishing with a layer of cream on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Cover the tiramisu and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld. Before serving, dust the top with cocoa powder using a fine sieve.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Tiramisu</h2>

    <p>This version of tiramisu is not only delicious but also offers several health benefits. Coconut cream is rich in healthy fats, which can support heart health and provide sustained energy. Gluten-free ladyfingers are easier to digest for those with gluten sensitivities, and using natural sweeteners like maple syrup reduces the overall sugar content compared to traditional recipes.</p>
