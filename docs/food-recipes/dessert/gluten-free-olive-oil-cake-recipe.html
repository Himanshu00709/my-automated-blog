<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with olive oil and line the bottom with parchment paper. This will ensure that your cake comes out easily after baking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy. Gradually add the olive oil while continuing to mix. Stir in the vanilla extract and lemon zest.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake the Cake</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can dust it with powdered sugar, top it with fresh berries, or enjoy it as is.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Olive Oil Cake</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different type of oil?</h3>
    <p>While olive oil is recommended for its unique flavor and health benefits, you can substitute it with other oils like coconut oil or avocado oil. However, keep in mind that this may alter the taste and texture of the cake.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the milk with a dairy-free alternative such as almond milk, oat milk, or coconut milk. The cake will still turn out moist and delicious.</p>

    <h3>3. How should I store the cake?</h3>
    <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, refrigerate it for up to a week. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I add other flavors to the cake?</h3>
    <p>Yes, this recipe is highly adaptable. You can add orange zest, almond extract, or even a handful of chocolate chips to customize the flavor to your liking.</p>
