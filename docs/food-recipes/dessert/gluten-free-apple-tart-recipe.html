    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Tart Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by making the tart dough. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, granulated sugar, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Apple Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the apple filling. Peel, core, and thinly slice the apples. Toss the apple slices with lemon juice, ground cinnamon, and brown sugar in a large bowl. Set aside to allow the flavors to meld.</p>

    <h3>3. Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has chilled, roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking) into a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Carefully transfer the dough to a tart pan, pressing it gently into the edges. Trim any excess dough from the edges.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Tart</h3>
    <p>Arrange the apple slices in a circular pattern over the tart dough, starting from the outer edge and working your way toward the center. Fold the edges of the dough over the apples, creating a rustic look. Brush the edges of the dough with a beaten egg to give the tart a golden finish.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake the Tart</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the tart in the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the apples are tender. Remove the tart from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours such as rice flour, oat flour, or a gluten-free baking mix. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this tart ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the tart dough and apple filling a day in advance. Store the dough in the refrigerator and the apple filling in an airtight container. Assemble and bake the tart when you’re ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover tart in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat it in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes to restore its crispiness.</p>
