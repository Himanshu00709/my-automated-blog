<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Making a gluten-free vanilla mug cake is incredibly simple. Follow these steps for a perfect result every time:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a microwave-safe mug, combine the gluten-free flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir until well mixed.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> Pour in the milk, oil (or melted butter), and vanilla extract. Stir until the batter is smooth and free of lumps.</li>
    <li><strong>Microwave:</strong> Place the mug in the microwave and cook on high for 1 to 1.5 minutes. Cooking times may vary depending on your microwave, so keep an eye on the cake to avoid overcooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool for a minute or two before enjoying. You can top it with whipped cream, fresh berries, or a drizzle of chocolate sauce for extra indulgence.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for the Perfect Mug Cake</h2>

<p>While the recipe is straightforward, here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free vanilla mug cake turns out perfectly:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a Good Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense cake. Stir just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust Cooking Time:</strong> Microwaves vary in power, so start with 1 minute and add 10-15 seconds if needed. The cake should be moist but not gooey.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> Get creative with your toppings! Try adding a scoop of ice cream, a sprinkle of cinnamon, or a handful of chocolate chips.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Vanilla Mug Cake</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I make this mug cake without a microwave?</h3>
    <p>Yes! If you don’t have a microwave, you can bake the mug cake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10-12 minutes. Just make sure to use an oven-safe mug.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
    <p>Almond flour can be used, but it will change the texture of the cake. Almond flour tends to make the cake denser and moister. For best results, stick to a gluten-free flour blend.</p>

    <h3>3. Is this mug cake suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the milk with a non-dairy alternative like almond milk or oat milk, and use vegetable oil instead of butter.</p>

    <h3>4. How can I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Mug cakes are best enjoyed fresh, but if you have leftovers, cover the mug with plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat in the microwave for 10-15 seconds before serving.</p>
</div>
