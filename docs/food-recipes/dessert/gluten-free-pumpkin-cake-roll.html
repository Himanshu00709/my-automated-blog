    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Cake Batter</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the pumpkin puree and mix until well combined. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</p>

    <h3>2. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Line a 15x10-inch jelly roll pan with parchment paper and lightly grease it. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the cake springs back when lightly touched. Be careful not to overbake, as this can make the cake dry and difficult to roll.</p>

    <h3>3. Roll the Cake</h3>
    <p>Once the cake is baked, immediately turn it out onto a clean kitchen towel dusted with powdered sugar. Carefully peel off the parchment paper. Starting at one short end, roll the cake up in the towel. Let it cool completely while rolled up. This step helps the cake retain its shape when you add the filling.</p>

    <h3>4. Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the cake is cooling, prepare the cream cheese filling. In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract together until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar, mixing until the filling is creamy and well combined.</p>

    <h3>5. Assemble the Cake Roll</h3>
    <p>Once the cake has cooled, carefully unroll it from the towel. Spread the cream cheese filling evenly over the cake, leaving a small border around the edges. Gently roll the cake back up, this time without the towel. Wrap the cake roll in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour before serving. This helps the filling set and makes the cake easier to slice.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free pumpkin cake roll can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be sure to succeed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overbake:</strong> Overbaking can make the cake dry and difficult to roll. Keep a close eye on the cake during the last few minutes of baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll the cake while it's warm:</strong> Rolling the cake while it's still warm helps it retain its shape and prevents cracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill before serving:</strong> Chilling the cake roll before serving makes it easier to slice and helps the filling set.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this cake roll ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make the cake roll a day in advance. Simply wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the pumpkin cake roll?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! The cake roll freezes well. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. It can be stored in the freezer for up to 2 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different filling?</h3>
        <p>While cream cheese filling is traditional, you can experiment with other fillings like whipped cream, chocolate ganache, or even a dairy-free alternative if you prefer.</p>

        <h3>What if my cake cracks when I roll it?</h3>
        <p>Don't worry if your cake cracks a little when you roll it. The filling will help hold it together, and the powdered sugar dusting will cover any imperfections.</p>
    </div>
