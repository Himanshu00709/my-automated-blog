    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, melted coconut oil, and maple syrup. Mix until the ingredients are well combined and the mixture resembles wet sand. Press the mixture into the bottom of a springform pan, ensuring it's evenly distributed. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool completely.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the crust is cooling, prepare the filling. Drain the soaked cashews and add them to a high-speed blender along with the coconut cream, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and agave syrup. Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. This may take a few minutes, so be patient. Once the filling is smooth, pour it over the cooled crust and spread it evenly with a spatula.</p>

    <h3>3. Chill the Cheesecake</h3>
    <p>Place the cheesecake in the refrigerator and let it chill for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. This will allow the filling to set and the flavors to meld together. Once the cheesecake is fully set, remove it from the refrigerator and carefully release it from the springform pan.</p>

    <h3>4. Add the Toppings</h3>
    <p>Before serving, top the cheesecake with fresh berries or any other toppings of your choice. You can also drizzle some melted dark chocolate or a sprinkle of shredded coconut for added flavor and texture.</p>
