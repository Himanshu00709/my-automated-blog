    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get baking! Follow these simple steps to create a vegan gluten-free applesauce cake that will impress your friends and family.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, coconut sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the applesauce, almond milk, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cake dense.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve as is or with a dusting of powdered sugar.</li>
    </ol>
