    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's walk through the steps to make this delicious cake:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper. This will ensure that your cake comes out easily after baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the yoghurt, sugar, eggs, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and well combined. Gradually add the vegetable oil while continuing to whisk.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can dust the cake with powdered sugar or drizzle it with a simple lemon glaze for added flavor.</p>
