    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that we have all the ingredients ready, let's move on to the step-by-step instructions for making this delicious gluten-free lemon pie.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by making the crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has chilled, roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Transfer the rolled-out dough to a 9-inch pie dish, pressing it gently into the bottom and sides. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges for a decorative finish. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork to prevent air bubbles, then refrigerate for another 15 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Blind Bake the Crust</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line the chilled crust with parchment paper and fill it with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove the weights and parchment paper and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Set aside to cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Make the Lemon Filling</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, whisk together the lemon juice, lemon zest, sugar, eggs, cornstarch, and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and comes to a gentle boil. Remove from heat and stir in the butter until fully melted and incorporated. Let the filling cool slightly before pouring it into the prepared crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the filling is in the crust, refrigerate the pie for at least 4 hours, or until the filling is set. Before serving, you can garnish the pie with whipped cream, fresh berries, or a dusting of powdered sugar. Slice and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Lemon Pie</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use store-bought gluten-free pie crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a store-bought gluten-free pie crust if you're short on time. Just make sure it's a high-quality brand that you trust. However, making your own crust allows you to control the ingredients and achieve a fresher, more buttery flavor.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this pie ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This pie can be made a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator. In fact, the flavors tend to meld and improve after a few hours of chilling. Just be sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap to prevent it from absorbing any odors from the fridge.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free lemon pie?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze this pie, but it's best to do so without any toppings. Wrap the pie tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, then freeze for up to 2 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of cornstarch?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use cornstarch, you can substitute it with arrowroot powder or tapioca starch. Both work well as thickeners in gluten-free recipes.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free lemon pie is a delightful dessert that combines the bright, tangy flavors of lemon with a buttery, crumbly crust. It's perfect for any occasion, whether you're hosting a summer barbecue or simply treating yourself to a sweet indulgence. With its easy-to-follow recipe and simple ingredients, this pie is a must-try for anyone who loves citrus desserts. So, roll up your sleeves, gather your ingredients, and get ready to bake a pie that will leave everyone asking for seconds!</p>
