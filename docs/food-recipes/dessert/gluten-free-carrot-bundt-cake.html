    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free carrot bundt cake is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a cake that’s moist, flavorful, and perfectly gluten-free:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease your bundt pan thoroughly with butter or a non-stick spray to ensure the cake releases easily after baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. This ensures that the dry ingredients are evenly distributed, which is crucial for a consistent texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, brown sugar, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract until well combined. The oil is key to keeping the cake moist, so don’t skip it!</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Fold in the Carrots</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the grated carrots into the wet mixture. Make sure the carrots are evenly distributed to ensure every bite is packed with flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Overmixing can lead to a dense cake, so be careful not to overdo it.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake and Cool</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared bundt pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Carrot Bundt Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>While almond flour can be used, it will result in a denser texture. For the best results, use a gluten-free flour blend specifically designed for baking.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I add nuts or raisins to the cake?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Chopped walnuts, pecans, or raisins can be added to the batter for extra texture and flavor. Just fold them in along with the carrots.</p>
    </div>

    <p>A gluten-free carrot bundt cake is a wonderful way to enjoy a classic dessert while adhering to a gluten-free lifestyle. With its moist texture, warm spices, and nutrient-rich carrots, this cake is sure to become a favorite in your household.
