    <h1>Gluten-Free Vanilla Pudding Recipe</h1>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free vanilla pudding:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium saucepan, whisk together the gluten-free cornstarch, sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Milk:</strong> Gradually whisk in the milk until the mixture is smooth and free of lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Over Medium Heat:</strong> Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and begins to bubble.</li>
        <li><strong>Temper Egg Yolks:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks. Slowly add a small amount of the hot milk mixture to the yolks, whisking constantly to prevent curdling. Then, pour the tempered yolks back into the saucepan.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Until Thick:</strong> Continue cooking and stirring for another 2-3 minutes until the pudding is thick and coats the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Butter and Vanilla:</strong> Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla extract until fully incorporated.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill:</strong> Pour the pudding into serving dishes, cover with plastic wrap (pressing it directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming), and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until set.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Vanilla Pudding</h2>
    <p>Here are some expert tips to ensure your pudding turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Vanilla:</strong> Pure vanilla extract makes a significant difference in flavor compared to artificial vanilla.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir Constantly:</strong> To avoid lumps and ensure even cooking, stir the pudding constantly while it's on the stove.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill Thoroughly:</strong> Allow the pudding to chill for at least 2 hours to achieve the perfect creamy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> Add fresh berries, whipped cream, or a sprinkle of cinnamon for extra flair.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Vanilla Pudding</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a dairy-free milk alternative?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute whole milk with almond milk, coconut milk, or any other dairy-free alternative. Just ensure it's unsweetened to control the sweetness of the pudding.</p>

        <h3>2. Is cornstarch always gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Most cornstarch is naturally gluten-free, but it's essential to check the label to ensure it hasn't been processed in a facility that handles gluten-containing products.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this pudding ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Gluten-free vanilla pudding can be made up to 2 days in advance. Store it in the refrigerator, covered, until ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>4. What can I do if my pudding is too thin?</h3>
        <p>If your pudding doesn't thicken as expected, mix an additional tablespoon of cornstarch with a small amount of cold milk, then whisk it into the pudding and cook for another minute or two.</p>
