<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the process of making this delightful cake:</p>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease your bundt pan thoroughly with butter or a non-stick spray to ensure the cake releases easily after baking.</p>

<h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and a pinch of salt. This ensures even distribution of the leavening agents, which is crucial for a well-risen cake.</p>

<h3>3. Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In another bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the melted butter (or coconut oil), Greek yogurt, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</p>

<h3>4. Fold in Blueberries</h3>
<p>Gently fold the fresh blueberries into the batter. To prevent them from sinking to the bottom, toss them in a little gluten-free flour before adding them to the mixture.</p>

<h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared bundt pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>6. Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before inverting it onto a wire rack. Once completely cooled, dust with powdered sugar or drizzle with a lemon glaze for an extra touch of sweetness.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until just combined for the best results.</li>
    <li><strong>Add a glaze or frosting:</strong> While the cake is delicious on its own, a simple lemon glaze or cream cheese frosting can take it to the next level.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries, but be sure to thaw and drain them thoroughly to avoid excess moisture in the batter.</p>

    <h3>How do I store this cake?</h3>
    <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Substitute the butter with coconut oil and use a dairy-free yogurt alternative to make this cake dairy-free.</p>

    <h3>What’s the best way to prevent the cake from sticking to the pan?</h3>
    <p>Grease the pan thoroughly with butter or non-stick spray, and consider dusting it with a light coating of gluten-free flour for extra insurance.</p>
