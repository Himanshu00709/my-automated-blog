<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all the ingredients ready, let's move on to the step-by-step instructions to make this gluten-free pecan cobbler.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cobbler bakes evenly and achieves the perfect texture.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Batter</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. Mix these dry ingredients thoroughly. Next, add the melted butter, milk, and vanilla extract. Stir until the batter is smooth and free of lumps.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add the Pecans</h3>
<p>Fold in the chopped pecans into the batter. Ensure that the pecans are evenly distributed throughout the mixture for a consistent flavor in every bite.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Pour the Batter</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread it evenly using a spatula to ensure that the cobbler bakes uniformly.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Prepare the Topping</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, mix the brown sugar and boiling water until the sugar is completely dissolved. Carefully pour this mixture over the batter in the baking dish. Do not stir; the topping will create a delicious caramel-like layer as it bakes.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake the Cobbler</h3>
<p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the cobbler is set. You can test the doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center; it should come out clean.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Once baked, remove the cobbler from the oven and let it cool for about 10 minutes. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra indulgent treat.</p>

<h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Pecan Cobbler</h2>

<p>To ensure your gluten-free pecan cobbler turns out perfectly every time, here are some expert tips:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Opt for a high-quality blend that mimics the texture of regular flour for the best results.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cobbler. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Toast the Pecans:</strong> For an extra layer of flavor, toast the pecans before adding them to the batter. This enhances their natural nuttiness.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a less sweet dessert, you can reduce the amount of sugar in the recipe. However, keep in mind that the sugar also contributes to the texture.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of nut?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute pecans with other nuts like walnuts or almonds. However, keep in mind that the flavor profile will change slightly.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil and use a non-dairy milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze this cobbler?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the cobbler for up to 2 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and reheat before serving.</p>
