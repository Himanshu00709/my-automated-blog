    <h2>Step-by-Step Gluten-Free Mooncake Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all the ingredients ready, let’s get started with the recipe. Follow these steps to create your gluten-free mooncakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and almond flour. In a separate bowl, mix the golden syrup (or honey) with the vegetable oil and water. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a smooth dough forms. Knead the dough gently until it’s pliable and not sticky. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is resting, prepare your filling. Traditional mooncakes are filled with lotus seed paste or red bean paste, but you can get creative with other fillings like chocolate, nuts, or even fruit preserves. Divide the filling into small portions, about 30g each, and roll them into balls.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Mooncakes</h3>
    <p>After the dough has rested, divide it into portions of about 20g each. Flatten each portion into a small disc and place a filling ball in the center. Carefully wrap the dough around the filling, ensuring it’s completely enclosed. Lightly dust your hands with gluten-free flour to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Shape the Mooncakes</h3>
    <p>Using a mooncake mold, press the filled dough into the mold to create the traditional mooncake shape. Gently tap the mold to release the mooncake. Repeat this process with the remaining dough and filling.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Mooncakes</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Place the mooncakes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. If desired, brush the tops of the mooncakes with a beaten egg yolk for a golden finish. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the mooncakes are lightly golden. Allow them to cool completely before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Mooncakes</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use other gluten-free flours?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours like coconut flour, sorghum flour, or buckwheat flour. However, keep in mind that each flour has a unique texture and flavor, so you may need to adjust the recipe accordingly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>2. How do I store gluten-free mooncakes?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free mooncakes can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate them for up to a week or freeze them for up to a month. Allow them to come to room temperature before serving.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>3. Can I make these mooncakes vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make vegan gluten-free mooncakes, replace the golden syrup with maple syrup or agave nectar, and use a plant-based oil instead of vegetable oil. Skip the egg yolk wash or use a plant-based alternative.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free mooncakes are a wonderful way to enjoy a traditional treat without compromising on taste or texture. With the right ingredients and a bit of patience, you can create mooncakes that are just as delicious as the original. Whether you’re celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival or simply exploring new baking adventures, this gluten-free mooncake recipe is sure to impress. Happy baking!</p>
