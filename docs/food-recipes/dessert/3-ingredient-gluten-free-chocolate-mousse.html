    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Melt the Chocolate</h3>

    <p>Start by melting the dark chocolate. You can do this using a double boiler or by microwaving it in short bursts, stirring in between. Be careful not to overheat the chocolate, as it can seize and become grainy. Once melted, set it aside to cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Whip the Cream</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, pour the cold heavy cream. Using an electric mixer or a whisk, whip the cream until it forms soft peaks. This means the cream should hold its shape but still be smooth and creamy. Be careful not to over-whip, as it can turn into butter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Once the chocolate has cooled slightly, gently fold it into the whipped cream. Add the honey or maple syrup to taste, and continue folding until the mixture is smooth and well combined. The key here is to be gentle to maintain the airy texture of the mousse.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Chill and Serve</h3>

    <p>Transfer the mousse into serving dishes or a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until set. When ready to serve, you can garnish with fresh berries, a sprinkle of cocoa powder, or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use milk chocolate if you prefer a sweeter mousse. However, keep in mind that milk chocolate has a lower cocoa content, so the flavor will be less intense. Adjust the sweetness accordingly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe as written is not vegan, as it contains heavy cream. However, you can make a vegan version by using coconut cream and a dairy-free chocolate. The process remains the same.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How long can I store the mousse?</h3>
        <p>The mousse can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Make sure it’s covered tightly with plastic wrap to prevent it from absorbing any odors from the fridge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I freeze the mousse?</h3>
        <p>While you can freeze the mousse, the texture may change slightly upon thawing. It’s best enjoyed fresh, but if you do freeze it, let it thaw in the refrigerator before serving.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <p>This 3-ingredient gluten-free chocolate mousse is a testament to the fact that sometimes, less is more. With just a handful of ingredients and minimal effort, you can create a dessert that’s both luxurious and satisfying.
