<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Apples</h3>

<p>Start by peeling, coring, and slicing the apples into thin, even slices. Place the apple slices in a large mixing bowl and toss them with a tablespoon of gluten-free flour, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg. This will help thicken the filling and infuse the apples with flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Make the Crumble Topping</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, rolled oats, and a pinch of salt. Add the coconut oil and maple syrup, and mix until the ingredients come together to form a crumbly texture. If the mixture feels too dry, you can add a bit more coconut oil or maple syrup until it reaches the desired consistency.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Transfer the prepared apple slices to a baking dish and spread them out evenly. Sprinkle the crumble topping over the apples, making sure to cover the entire surface. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the apples are tender.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Allow the apple crumble to cool slightly before serving. It pairs wonderfully with a scoop of dairy-free vanilla ice cream or a dollop of coconut whipped cream. Enjoy your gluten-free dairy-free apple crumble warm, and savor every bite!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! While apples are the classic choice for a crumble, you can experiment with other fruits like pears, peaches, or berries. Just adjust the sweetness and spices accordingly to complement the fruit you choose.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the apple crumble ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to two days before baking. When you’re ready to serve, simply bake it as directed, adding a few extra minutes if needed.</p>

    <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>Yes, this gluten-free dairy-free apple crumble is vegan-friendly as long as you use maple syrup or another plant-based sweetener. Coconut oil or vegan butter ensures that the recipe remains dairy-free.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze the apple crumble?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the unbaked apple crumble for up to three months. When you’re ready to bake, simply thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and bake as directed. You may need to add a few extra minutes to the baking time.</p>
