    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by crushing the gluten-free graham crackers into fine crumbs. You can do this by placing them in a zip-top bag and using a rolling pin to crush them. Mix the crumbs with melted butter until well combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, making sure to create an even layer. Place the pan in the refrigerator to set while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth. Add the pumpkin puree, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and pumpkin pie spice. Mix until all ingredients are well combined. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until fully incorporated.</p>

    <h3>3. Add Gelatin</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over 2 tablespoons of water and let it bloom for about 5 minutes. Microwave the gelatin mixture for 10-15 seconds until it becomes liquid. Quickly stir the liquid gelatin into the cheesecake filling, ensuring it's evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Cheesecake</h3>
    <p>Pour the filling over the prepared crust in the springform pan. Smooth the top with a spatula. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until the cheesecake is set.</p>

    <h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the cheesecake is fully set, remove it from the refrigerator. Carefully release the sides of the springform pan. Slice the cheesecake into even pieces and serve chilled. You can garnish with whipped cream, a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice, or even a drizzle of caramel sauce for an extra touch of indulgence.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this cheesecake ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This gluten-free no-bake pumpkin cheesecake can be made a day in advance. Simply keep it refrigerated until you're ready to serve. It's a great make-ahead dessert for holiday gatherings or dinner parties.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize the crust to your liking. If you prefer a nut-based crust, you can use crushed almonds or pecans mixed with a bit of melted butter. Alternatively, you can use gluten-free cookies or even a simple press-in crust made from almond flour.</p>

        <h3>Is this cheesecake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>This recipe contains cream cheese and heavy cream, which are dairy products. However, you can make a dairy-free version by using dairy-free cream cheese and coconut cream instead of heavy cream. Just be sure to check the labels to ensure all ingredients are gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>How long does this cheesecake last in the fridge?</h3>
        <p>This cheesecake will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container to maintain its freshness.</p>
