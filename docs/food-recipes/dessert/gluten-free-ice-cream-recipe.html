    <h1>Gluten-Free Ice Cream Recipe: A Delicious and Safe Treat</h1>
    <p>Ice cream is a beloved dessert enjoyed by people of all ages. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding a safe and delicious ice cream option can be challenging.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free ice cream:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Base</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, whole milk, and half of the sugar. Heat the mixture over medium heat until it reaches a gentle simmer. Stir occasionally to prevent scorching.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Temper the Egg Yolks (Optional)</h3>
    <p>If you’re using egg yolks for a custard base, whisk the yolks with the remaining sugar in a separate bowl until pale and creamy. Slowly pour a small amount of the hot cream mixture into the yolks, whisking constantly to temper them. Then, pour the tempered yolks back into the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Chill the Mixture</h3>
    <p>Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Let the mixture cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Chilling the mixture ensures a smoother texture when churned.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Churn the Ice Cream</h3>
    <p>Pour the chilled mixture into your ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This usually takes about 20-30 minutes. If you don’t have an ice cream maker, you can freeze the mixture in a shallow dish and stir it every 30 minutes until it reaches the desired consistency.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add Mix-Ins</h3>
    <p>During the last few minutes of churning, add your favorite gluten-free mix-ins, such as chocolate chips, fresh fruit, or nuts. Transfer the ice cream to a lidded container and freeze for at least 2 hours to firm up before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Ice Cream</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Is all ice cream gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Not all ice cream is gluten-free. Some flavors and brands may contain gluten-containing ingredients or be processed in facilities that handle gluten. Always check the label or make your own at home to ensure it’s safe.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I use alternative sweeteners?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute granulated sugar with alternative sweeteners like honey, maple syrup, or stevia. Keep in mind that this may alter the texture and freezing properties of the ice cream.</p>

        <h3>3. How long does homemade gluten-free ice cream last?</h3>
        <p>Homemade ice cream can be stored in the freezer for up to 2 weeks. For the best texture, let it sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes before serving.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make dairy-free gluten-free ice cream?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the heavy cream and whole milk with dairy-free alternatives like coconut milk, almond milk, or oat milk. Just ensure they are certified gluten-free.</p>
