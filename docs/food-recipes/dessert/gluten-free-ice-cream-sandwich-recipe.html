    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that we have all the ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make these gluten-free ice cream sandwiches.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent the cookies from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer on medium speed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Egg and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the egg and vanilla extract to the butter-sugar mixture. Beat until well combined. The mixture should be smooth and slightly creamy.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Shape the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Flatten each ball slightly with the back of a spoon or your fingers. Make sure to leave enough space between each cookie as they will spread during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft. Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Assemble the Ice Cream Sandwiches</h3>
    <p>Once the cookies have cooled completely, it's time to assemble the ice cream sandwiches. Take a scoop of your favorite gluten-free ice cream and place it on the flat side of one cookie. Top with another cookie, flat side down, and gently press together. Repeat with the remaining cookies and ice cream.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Freeze the Sandwiches</h3>
    <p>Place the assembled ice cream sandwiches on a baking sheet and freeze for at least 2 hours, or until firm. This will help the sandwiches hold their shape and make them easier to eat.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, such as rice flour, oat flour, or coconut flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor of the cookies may vary depending on the flour you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these sandwiches ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! These gluten-free ice cream sandwiches can be made ahead of time and stored in the freezer for up to 2 weeks. Just make sure to wrap them individually in plastic wrap or place them in an airtight container to prevent freezer burn.</p>

        <h3>What if I don't have an electric mixer?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have an electric mixer, you can mix the ingredients by hand using a wooden spoon or a whisk. It may take a bit more effort, but the results will be just as delicious.</p>

        <h3>Can I use dairy-free ice cream?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use dairy-free ice cream if you're looking for a vegan or lactose-free option. There are many delicious dairy-free ice cream brands available that work perfectly in this recipe.</p>
