<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's walk through the steps to create this delightful dessert:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your crumble bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown topping.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Fruit Filling</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced strawberries and chopped rhubarb. Add the granulated sugar and cornstarch, and gently toss until the fruit is evenly coated. The sugar will help sweeten the tart rhubarb, while the cornstarch will thicken the filling as it bakes.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Make the Crumble Topping</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free oats, almond flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter (or dairy-free alternative) and use your fingers or a pastry cutter to work the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>
<p>Transfer the fruit mixture to a baking dish and spread it out evenly. Sprinkle the crumble topping over the fruit, covering it completely. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit filling is bubbling.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Allow the crumble to cool slightly before serving. It can be enjoyed on its own or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra indulgent treat.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen strawberries and rhubarb?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries and rhubarb if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to prevent excess moisture in the filling.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter, to make this crumble vegan-friendly.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover crumble in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat it in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours, such as oat flour or rice flour. However, the texture of the crumble may vary slightly.</p>
