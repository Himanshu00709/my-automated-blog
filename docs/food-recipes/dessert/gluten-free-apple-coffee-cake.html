    <h1>Gluten-Free Apple Coffee Cake: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>When it comes to comfort food, few things can rival the warm, inviting aroma of a freshly baked coffee cake. Add the sweet, tangy flavor of apples, and you have a dessert that’s perfect for any occasion. But what if you’re following a gluten-free diet? Fear not! This gluten-free apple coffee cake is here to satisfy your cravings without compromising your dietary needs. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free baking, provide a step-by-step recipe, and answer some frequently asked questions about this delightful treat.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Baking?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has gained immense popularity over the years, and for good reason. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, avoiding gluten is essential to maintaining good health. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause inflammation and damage to the small intestine in those with celiac disease. Even for those without gluten intolerance, reducing gluten intake can lead to improved digestion, increased energy levels, and better overall health.</p>
    <p>Moreover, gluten-free baking doesn’t mean sacrificing flavor or texture. With the right ingredients and techniques, you can create baked goods that are just as delicious—if not more so—than their gluten-containing counterparts. This gluten-free apple coffee cake is a perfect example of how you can enjoy a classic dessert without the gluten.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2>
    <p>Before we dive into the recipe, let’s take a look at the ingredients you’ll need to make this gluten-free apple coffee cake. The key to successful gluten-free baking lies in choosing the right flour blend. For this recipe, we’ll be using a combination of almond flour and gluten-free all-purpose flour to achieve the perfect texture.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the recipe. Follow these steps to create a gluten-free apple coffee cake that’s moist, flavorful, and utterly irresistible.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, ground cinnamon, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer on medium speed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake. Fold in the Greek yogurt until the batter is smooth and well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Add Apples</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the diced apples, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Prepare the Topping</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar and chopped walnuts (if using). This will be sprinkled on top of the cake before baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and spread it evenly. Sprinkle the brown sugar and walnut mixture over the top. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature, and enjoy!</p>
