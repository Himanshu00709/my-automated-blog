    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making this delicious gluten-free berry crisp.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you're ready to bake the crisp.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Berry Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the mixed berries, granulated sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice. Gently toss the berries until they are evenly coated with the sugar and cornstarch mixture. This will help thicken the berry filling as it bakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Crisp Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix together the gluten-free rolled oats, almond flour, brown sugar, ground cinnamon, and salt. Cut the cold unsalted butter into small pieces and add it to the dry ingredients. Use your fingers or a pastry cutter to work the butter into the mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Transfer the berry mixture to a greased baking dish, spreading it out evenly. Sprinkle the crisp topping over the berries, covering them completely. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the berry filling is bubbling.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the crisp is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Serve it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra special treat.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen berries for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen berries if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to prevent excess moisture in the filling.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can be made vegan by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours, such as coconut flour or rice flour, but keep in mind that the texture of the topping may vary.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
