    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free vanilla cake in a mug:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Mug:</strong> Choose a microwave-safe mug that can hold at least 8 ounces of liquid. Lightly grease the inside with a small amount of oil or butter to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In the mug, combine the gluten-free flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir well to ensure there are no lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> Pour in the milk, oil (or melted butter), and vanilla extract. Mix thoroughly until the batter is smooth and free of clumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Microwave:</strong> Place the mug in the microwave and cook on high for 1 to 1.5 minutes. The exact time may vary depending on your microwave’s wattage, so keep an eye on the cake to avoid overcooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool for a minute or two before enjoying. You can top it with whipped cream, fresh berries, or a drizzle of chocolate sauce for extra indulgence.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Mug Cake</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free vanilla cake in a mug turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Opt for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking, as it will yield a better texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense and rubbery cake. Stir just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Cooking Time:</strong> Microwaves vary in power, so start with 1 minute and check the cake. If it’s still undercooked, add 10-15 seconds at a time until done.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> While vanilla is a classic flavor, you can elevate your mug cake with toppings like caramel sauce, sprinkles, or a dusting of powdered sugar.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Vanilla Cake in a Mug</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour can be used, but it will result in a denser and more moist cake. For a lighter texture, stick to a gluten-free flour blend designed for baking.</p>

        <h3>2. Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Simply replace the milk with a non-dairy alternative like almond or oat milk, and use vegetable oil instead of butter.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this cake in the oven instead of the microwave?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and bake the cake in an oven-safe ramekin for about 12-15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store leftover mug cake?</h3>
        <p>Mug cakes are best enjoyed fresh, but if you have leftovers, cover the mug with plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat in the microwave before serving.</p>
