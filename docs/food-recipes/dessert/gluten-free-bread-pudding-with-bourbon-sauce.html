<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Bread Pudding</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). While the oven is heating, grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with butter. Cut the gluten-free bread into 1-inch cubes and spread them evenly in the prepared dish. If you're using raisins, sprinkle them over the bread cubes.</p>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the milk, heavy cream, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, and ground cinnamon until well combined. Pour this mixture over the bread cubes, making sure all the bread is soaked. Let it sit for about 10 minutes to allow the bread to absorb the custard.</p>

<h3>2. Baking the Pudding</h3>

<p>Once the bread has absorbed the custard, place the baking dish in the preheated oven. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the custard is set. You can test the doneness by inserting a knife into the center; it should come out clean.</p>

<h3>3. Making the Bourbon Sauce</h3>

<p>While the bread pudding is baking, you can prepare the bourbon sauce. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sugar and stir until it dissolves. Slowly pour in the heavy cream, stirring constantly to avoid curdling. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>

<p>Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the bourbon and vanilla extract. Be cautious when adding the bourbon, as it can cause the sauce to bubble up. Let the sauce cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h3>4. Serving the Bread Pudding</h3>

<p>Once the bread pudding is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Cut it into squares and serve warm, drizzled with the bourbon sauce. For an extra touch, you can add a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream on top.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use any type of gluten-free bread?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use any type of gluten-free bread for this recipe. However, for the best texture, choose a bread that is slightly stale or has a denser crumb. This will help the bread hold up better when soaked in the custard.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the whole milk and heavy cream with your favorite non-dairy alternatives, such as almond milk or coconut milk. Just make sure to choose unsweetened varieties to avoid altering the sweetness of the dessert.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Leftover bread pudding can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply place it in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10-15 minutes, or until warmed through. The bourbon sauce can be stored separately and reheated gently on the stovetop.</p>

    <h3>Can I omit the bourbon from the sauce?</h3>
    <p>If you prefer not to use bourbon, you can omit it from the sauce. The sauce will still be delicious with just the butter, sugar, cream, and vanilla. Alternatively, you can add a splash of rum or brandy for a different flavor profile.</p>
</div>

This recipe is perfect for anyone looking to enjoy a classic comfort food with a modern twist.
