    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Making the Gluten-Free Bread Pudding</h3>

    <p>1. <strong>Preheat your oven</strong> to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with butter.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Prepare the bread</strong>: If your gluten-free bread is not stale, toast it lightly and then cut it into 1-inch cubes. Place the cubes in the prepared baking dish.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Make the custard</strong>: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the milk, heavy cream, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon until well combined.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Combine</strong>: Pour the custard mixture over the bread cubes, ensuring that all the bread is soaked. If using raisins or dried cranberries, sprinkle them evenly over the top.</p>
    <p>5. <strong>Bake</strong>: Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the custard is set.</p>

    <h3>Making the Bourbon Sauce</h3>

    <p>1. <strong>Melt the butter</strong>: In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Add sugar and cream</strong>: Stir in the sugar and heavy cream, and bring the mixture to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Add bourbon and vanilla</strong>: Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the bourbon and vanilla extract. Be cautious as the mixture may bubble up.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Serve</strong>: Drizzle the warm bourbon sauce over individual servings of the bread pudding.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use any type of gluten-free bread?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free bread for this recipe. However, it’s best to choose a bread that is sturdy and not too crumbly, as it will hold up better when soaked in the custard.</p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover bread pudding in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat it in the oven or microwave before serving, and make a fresh batch of bourbon sauce if desired.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I omit the bourbon from the sauce?</h3>
        <p>Yes, if you prefer not to use alcohol, you can omit the bourbon from the sauce. The sauce will still be delicious with just the butter, sugar, cream, and vanilla.</p>
    </div>
