<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Base</h3>

<p>Start by combining the coconut milk and almond milk in a medium-sized saucepan. Heat the mixture over medium heat until it begins to simmer. Be careful not to let it boil, as this can cause the milk to separate.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Add Sweetener and Thickener</h3>

<p>Once the milk mixture is warm, add the maple syrup and arrowroot powder. Whisk continuously to ensure that the arrowroot powder is fully dissolved and there are no lumps. The arrowroot powder will help thicken the mixture, giving your ice cream a creamy texture.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Flavor the Mixture</h3>

<p>Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract and sea salt. These ingredients will enhance the flavor of your ice cream and give it a rich, satisfying taste.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Chill the Mixture</h3>

<p>Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature, then transfer it to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until it is completely chilled. Chilling the mixture is crucial for achieving the right consistency when you churn the ice cream.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Churn the Ice Cream</h3>

<p>Once the mixture is thoroughly chilled, pour it into your ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions. This usually takes about 20-30 minutes. If you don't have an ice cream maker, you can pour the mixture into a shallow dish and freeze it, stirring every 30 minutes until it reaches the desired consistency.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Once the ice cream is churned, it's ready to serve! Scoop it into bowls or cones and enjoy immediately. If you have any leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the freezer. Just be sure to let the ice cream soften for a few minutes before serving again.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of milk?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute the almond milk with any other non-dairy milk, such as oat milk, soy milk, or cashew milk. Just be sure to choose an unsweetened variety to control the sweetness of your ice cream.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe without an ice cream maker?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! If you don't have an ice cream maker, you can still make this recipe by freezing the mixture in a shallow dish and stirring it every 30 minutes until it reaches the desired consistency. This method may take a bit longer, but it will still result in delicious ice cream.</p>

    <h3>How long does homemade gluten and dairy-free ice cream last?</h3>
    <p>Homemade ice cream is best enjoyed within a week of making it. Store it in an airtight container in the freezer to prevent ice crystals from forming. If you notice any changes in texture or flavor, it's best to discard the ice cream.</p>

    <h3>Can I add mix-ins to this recipe?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can customize your ice cream by adding mix-ins such as chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or fruit. Just be sure to add them during the last few minutes of churning to ensure they are evenly distributed throughout the ice cream.</p>
