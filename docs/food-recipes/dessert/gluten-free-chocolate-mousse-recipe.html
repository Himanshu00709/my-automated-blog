    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Melt the Chocolate and Butter</h3>
    <p>Begin by melting the dark chocolate and unsalted butter together. You can do this using a double boiler or by microwaving them in short bursts, stirring in between until smooth. Be careful not to overheat the chocolate, as it can seize and become grainy.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Whip the Egg Whites</h3>
    <p>In a clean, dry bowl, whip the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they form stiff peaks. This will help to give the mousse its light and airy texture. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Egg Yolks and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the granulated sugar until the mixture becomes pale and slightly thickened. This step is crucial for creating a smooth and creamy mousse.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Fold in the Chocolate Mixture</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the melted chocolate and butter mixture into the egg yolk and sugar mixture. Be careful not to overmix, as this can deflate the air bubbles and result in a denser mousse.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Incorporate the Whipped Cream</h3>
    <p>In another bowl, whip the heavy cream until it forms soft peaks. Add the vanilla extract and gently fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture. This will add richness and a velvety texture to the mousse.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in the Egg Whites</h3>
    <p>Finally, fold the whipped egg whites into the chocolate mixture. This step is essential for achieving the light and airy consistency that is characteristic of a perfect chocolate mousse.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Divide the mousse into serving glasses or bowls and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until set. Before serving, you can garnish with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, or fresh berries for an extra touch of elegance.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use milk chocolate if you prefer a sweeter mousse. However, keep in mind that milk chocolate contains less cocoa and more sugar, which may alter the texture and flavor of the mousse.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe contains eggs and dairy, so it is not suitable for vegans. However, you can make a vegan version by using plant-based alternatives such as coconut cream and aquafaba (chickpea water) instead of heavy cream and egg whites.</p>

        <h3>How long can I store the chocolate mousse?</h3>
        <p>The chocolate mousse can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Make sure to cover it with plastic wrap or place it in an airtight container to prevent it from absorbing any odors from the fridge.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the chocolate mousse?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the chocolate mousse for up to 1 month. However, the texture may change slightly upon thawing, so it's best to consume it fresh if possible.</p>
