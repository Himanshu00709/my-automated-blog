<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Creating a gluten-free cheesecake crust is straightforward and requires minimal effort. Follow these steps to achieve the perfect crust:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your crust bakes evenly and achieves the desired crispiness.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, gluten-free oats (if using), sugar, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of ingredients.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add the Butter</h3>
<p>Melt the unsalted butter (or coconut oil) and pour it into the dry mixture. Stir until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs and holds together when pressed.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Press into the Pan</h3>
<p>Transfer the mixture to a 9-inch springform pan. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of the pan, ensuring an even layer. Use the back of a spoon or a flat-bottomed glass to smooth the surface.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake the Crust</h3>
<p>Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely before adding the cheesecake filling.</p>

<h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Crust</h2>

<p>Here are some additional tips to ensure your gluten-free cheesecake crust turns out perfectly:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh almond flour and gluten-free oats will yield the best results.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill the Crust:</strong> If you have time, chill the crust in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before baking. This helps it hold its shape better.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add a teaspoon of cinnamon or vanilla extract to the crust mixture for extra flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Keep an eye on the crust while baking to prevent over-browning.</li>
</ul>
