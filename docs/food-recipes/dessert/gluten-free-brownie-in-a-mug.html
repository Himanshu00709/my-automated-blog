    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to make your gluten-free brownie in a mug:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a microwave-safe mug, combine the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Stir until well mixed.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> Add the milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the mug. Stir until the mixture is smooth and there are no lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Chocolate Chips:</strong> If you’re using chocolate chips, sprinkle them on top of the batter or mix them in for an extra chocolatey treat.</li>
        <li><strong>Microwave:</strong> Place the mug in the microwave and cook on high for about 1 minute. Check the brownie; if it’s still too gooey, microwave for an additional 15-30 seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Let the brownie cool for a minute or two before digging in. Be careful, as the mug will be hot!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Brownie in a Mug</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free brownie in a mug turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Large Mug:</strong> Make sure your mug is large enough to accommodate the rising batter. A standard 12-ounce mug should work well.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook:</strong> The brownie will continue to cook slightly after you remove it from the microwave, so it’s better to undercook it slightly than to overcook it.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a dollop of whipped cream, or a drizzle of caramel sauce for an extra indulgent treat.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a less sweet brownie, reduce the amount of sugar or use a sugar substitute like stevia.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, almond flour can be used as a substitute for gluten-free flour. However, the texture may be slightly different, and you may need to adjust the amount of liquid in the recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this brownie in the oven instead of the microwave?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer to use an oven, preheat it to 350°F (175°C) and bake the brownie in an oven-safe mug for about 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can be made dairy-free by using a dairy-free milk alternative, such as almond milk or oat milk, and ensuring that the chocolate chips are also dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How can I make this brownie vegan?</h3>
        <p>To make this brownie vegan, use a dairy-free milk alternative and replace the sugar with a vegan-friendly sweetener. Additionally, ensure that the chocolate chips are vegan.</p>
