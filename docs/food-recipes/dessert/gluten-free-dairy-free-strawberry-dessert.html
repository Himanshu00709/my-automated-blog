    <p>Creating gluten-free dairy-free desserts can be a bit challenging, but with the right tips, you can achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Opt for a high-quality gluten-free flour blend that is specifically designed for baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh strawberries and high-quality dairy-free milk will enhance the flavor and texture of your desserts.</li>
