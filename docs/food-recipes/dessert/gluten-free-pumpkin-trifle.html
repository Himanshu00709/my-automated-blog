    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Gluten-Free Cake or Cookies</h3>

    <p>If you're using store-bought gluten-free cake or cookies, simply cut the cake into cubes or crumble the cookies into bite-sized pieces. If you prefer to make your own, bake a gluten-free vanilla or spice cake according to your favorite recipe and allow it to cool completely before cutting it into cubes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Pumpkin Cream Filling</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, pumpkin puree, powdered sugar, pumpkin pie spice, and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth and well combined. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the pumpkin mixture until fully incorporated. This will create a light, fluffy filling that's perfect for layering.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Trifle</h3>

    <p>In a large trifle dish or glass bowl, start by layering the bottom with a portion of the gluten-free cake or cookie pieces. Spread a generous layer of the pumpkin cream filling over the cake, ensuring it covers the entire surface. Repeat the layers until you reach the top of the dish, finishing with a layer of the pumpkin cream. For an extra touch of elegance, sprinkle chopped pecans or walnuts on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Chill and Serve</h3>

    <p>Cover the trifle with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight, to allow the flavors to meld together. When ready to serve, scoop out portions with a large spoon, ensuring each serving gets a bit of every layer. Enjoy!</p>
