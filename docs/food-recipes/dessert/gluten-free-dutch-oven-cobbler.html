    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free Dutch oven cobbler.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Fruit Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by preparing your fruit. If you're using fresh fruit, wash and slice it as needed. Toss the fruit with a bit of sugar (about 1/4 cup) and lemon juice to enhance the natural flavors. If you're using frozen fruit, there's no need to thaw it beforehand—just add it directly to the Dutch oven.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the milk and melted butter until the mixture forms a thick batter. This will be your cobbler topping, which will bake into a golden, crumbly crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Cobbler</h3>
    <p>Spread the fruit evenly in the bottom of your Dutch oven. Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler batter over the fruit, covering as much of the surface as possible. Don't worry if there are gaps—the batter will spread as it bakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Cobbler</h3>
    <p>If you're baking indoors, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and place the Dutch oven inside. Bake for 35-45 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling. If you're cooking outdoors, place the Dutch oven over a bed of hot coals and cover it with the lid. Add a few coals on top of the lid to create an even baking environment. Cook for about 30-40 minutes, checking occasionally to ensure it doesn't burn.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cobbler</h2>
    <p>Here are a few tips to ensure your gluten-free Dutch oven cobbler turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a reliable gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that's specifically designed for baking, and make sure it contains xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense, tough crust. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust sweetness to taste:</strong> Depending on the fruit you're using, you may want to adjust the amount of sugar in both the fruit filling and the cobbler topping.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it rest before serving:</strong> Allow the cobbler to cool for a few minutes before serving. This will give the filling time to set and make it easier to scoop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use any type of fruit for this cobbler?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This recipe is highly versatile, and you can use almost any fruit you like. Berries, peaches, apples, and even tropical fruits like mango or pineapple work well. Just adjust the sugar to taste based on the sweetness of the fruit.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cobbler ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the fruit filling and the cobbler batter ahead of time and store them separately in the refrigerator. When you're ready to bake, simply assemble the cobbler and bake as directed. You can also bake the cobbler a day in advance and reheat it before serving.</p>

        <h3>What if I don't have a Dutch oven?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have a Dutch oven, you can use a deep baking dish or a cast-iron skillet. Just be sure to adjust the baking time as needed, as different cookware may affect how quickly the cobbler bakes.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this recipe can easily be made vegan by using a non-dairy milk alternative (such as almond or oat milk) and a dairy-free butter substitute. Just ensure that all your ingredients are vegan-friendly.</p>
