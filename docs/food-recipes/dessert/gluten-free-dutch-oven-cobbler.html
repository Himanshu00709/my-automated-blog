    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free Dutch oven cobbler:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Dutch Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your Dutch oven by placing it over medium heat. If you're using a cast iron Dutch oven, make sure it's well-seasoned to prevent sticking. You can also preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) if you prefer baking the cobbler indoors.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Fruit Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, combine your chosen fruit with sugar, lemon juice, and cornstarch. Mix well to ensure the fruit is evenly coated. This mixture will create a sweet, syrupy filling as it bakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Cobbler Batter</h3>
    <p>In another bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the milk and melted butter, stirring until the batter is smooth and free of lumps.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Cobbler</h3>
    <p>Pour the fruit mixture into the preheated Dutch oven. Spoon the batter evenly over the fruit, spreading it out with a spatula if necessary. The batter will rise and form a golden crust as it bakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cobbler</h3>
    <p>Cover the Dutch oven with its lid and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the fruit filling is bubbling. If you're baking indoors, place the Dutch oven in the preheated oven and follow the same baking time.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the cobbler is done, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly before serving. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra indulgent treat.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfecting Your Gluten-Free Dutch Oven Cobbler</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free Dutch oven cobbler turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cobbler. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh, Seasonal Fruit:</strong> Fresh fruit will give your cobbler the best flavor. If using frozen fruit, make sure to thaw and drain it first.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> Depending on the sweetness of your fruit, you may want to adjust the amount of sugar in the filling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as almond flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture may vary, so it's best to use a blend specifically designed for baking.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cobbler vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the butter with vegan butter and use a non-dairy milk alternative, such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cobbler ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the fruit filling and batter ahead of time and assemble the cobbler just before baking. This is a great option for entertaining.</p>
