    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Rhubarb</h3>
    <p>Start by washing and chopping the rhubarb into 1-inch pieces. Place the rhubarb in a mixing bowl and toss it with 50g of sugar. Let it sit for about 15 minutes to allow the rhubarb to release some of its juices.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Crumble Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free oats, almond flour, remaining sugar, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Add the coconut oil (or butter) and vanilla extract. Use your fingers to mix the ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

    <h3>3. Assembling the Crumble</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Transfer the rhubarb mixture to a baking dish and spread it evenly. Sprinkle the crumble topping over the rhubarb, making sure to cover it completely.</p>

    <h3>4. Baking</h3>
    <p>Bake the crumble in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the rhubarb is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>
