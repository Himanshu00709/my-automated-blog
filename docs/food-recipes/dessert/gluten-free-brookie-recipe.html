    <h1>Gluten-Free Brookie Recipe: The Perfect Dessert for Everyone</h1>
    <p>If you're a fan of both brownies and cookies, then you're in for a treat! The brookie—a delightful combination of a brownie and a cookie—is the ultimate dessert that satisfies all your sweet cravings. But what if you're following a gluten-free diet? Don't worry, we've got you covered. This gluten-free brookie recipe is not only delicious but also easy to make, ensuring that everyone can enjoy this decadent treat without compromising their dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>What is a Brookie?</h2>
    <p>A brookie is a hybrid dessert that combines the best of both worlds: the chewy, fudgy texture of a brownie and the crispy, buttery goodness of a cookie. The result is a dessert that's rich, indulgent, and utterly irresistible. The gluten-free version of this treat ensures that those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease can still enjoy this delightful dessert without any worries.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients You'll Need</h2>
    <p>Before we dive into the recipe, let's take a look at the ingredients you'll need to make these gluten-free brookies. The ingredients are divided into two parts: one for the brownie layer and one for the cookie layer.</p>

    <h3>For the Brownie Layer:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Cookie Layer:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup gluten-free chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make these gluten-free brookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a 9x9 inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang on the sides for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Brownie Batter</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. In a separate large bowl, mix the melted butter and granulated sugar until well combined. Add the eggs and vanilla extract, and mix until smooth. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Cookie Dough</h3>
    <p>In another medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, and salt. In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Brookies</h3>
    <p>Spread the brownie batter evenly into the prepared baking pan. Drop spoonfuls of the cookie dough on top of the brownie batter, spreading it out as evenly as possible. Use a knife or spatula to gently swirl the two layers together, creating a marbled effect.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake and Cool</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Allow the brookies to cool completely in the pan before lifting them out using the parchment paper overhang. Cut into squares and serve.</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the recipe to be gluten-free. However, if you're catering to someone with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, it's essential to use gluten-free flour to ensure the recipe is safe for them to consume.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these brookies ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! These brookies can be made ahead of time and stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them for up to 2 months. Just make sure to thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or other mix-ins?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize your brookies by adding nuts, dried fruits, or other mix-ins to the cookie dough or brownie batter. Just make sure that any additional ingredients you use are also gluten-free if you're keeping the recipe gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>What's the best way to store brookies?</h3>
        <p>Brookies should be stored in an airtight container at room temperature. If you live in a particularly warm or humid climate, you may want to store them in the refrigerator to prevent them from becoming too soft or sticky.</p>
