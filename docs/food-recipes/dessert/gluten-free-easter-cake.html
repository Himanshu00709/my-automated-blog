    <h1>Gluten-Free Easter Cake: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>Easter is a time for celebration, family gatherings, and, of course, delicious food. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding the perfect Easter treat can be a challenge. However, with the right ingredients and a bit of creativity, you can create a gluten-free Easter cake that is not only delicious but also healthy. In this blog post, we will explore the benefits of a gluten-free diet, provide a detailed recipe for a gluten-free Easter cake, and answer some frequently asked questions about gluten-free baking.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Diet?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of health issues, including digestive problems, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. A gluten-free diet is essential for managing these conditions and improving overall health. Additionally, many people without gluten-related disorders choose to go gluten-free to experience potential health benefits, such as improved digestion, increased energy levels, and better nutrient absorption.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Easter Cake Recipe</h2>

    <p>This gluten-free Easter cake is moist, flavorful, and perfect for your holiday celebration. The recipe uses almond flour and coconut flour as the base, providing a rich, nutty flavor and a tender crumb. The cake is topped with a creamy, dairy-free frosting and decorated with fresh berries and edible flowers for a festive touch.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch round cake pan with coconut oil.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure there are no lumps.</li>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Baking</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I substitute almond flour with another gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours such as oat flour, rice flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor of the cake may vary depending on the flour you choose.</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>2. How do I store a gluten-free cake?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cakes tend to dry out faster than traditional cakes due to the absence of gluten. To keep your cake moist, store it in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>3. Can I make this cake vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this cake vegan by substituting the eggs with a flaxseed or chia seed egg replacement. To make a flaxseed egg, mix 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed with 3 tablespoons of water and let it sit for 5 minutes until it becomes gel-like. Use this mixture as a replacement for each egg in the recipe.</p>
