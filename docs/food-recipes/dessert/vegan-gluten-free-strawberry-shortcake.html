    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Strawberries</h3>
    <p>Start by washing and slicing the strawberries. Place them in a bowl and sprinkle with a little maple syrup to enhance their natural sweetness. Set aside to macerate while you prepare the shortcake.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Shortcake Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond milk, melted coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a soft dough forms.</p>

    <h3>3. Bake the Shortcake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop the dough onto the sheet, forming small rounds. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the shortcakes are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow them to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Shortcake</h3>
    <p>Once the shortcakes have cooled, slice them in half horizontally. Spoon a generous amount of the macerated strawberries onto the bottom half. Top with a dollop of coconut whipped cream, then place the top half of the shortcake over the cream. Garnish with additional strawberries and a drizzle of maple syrup if desired.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can result in a dense shortcake. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh strawberries and high-quality coconut whipped cream will elevate the flavor of your dessert.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Immediately:</strong> Vegan gluten-free strawberry shortcake is best enjoyed fresh. If you need to prepare it in advance, store the components separately and assemble just before serving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen strawberries?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries, but be sure to thaw and drain them thoroughly to avoid excess moisture in your dessert.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What can I use instead of coconut whipped cream?</h3>
        <p>If you’re not a fan of coconut, you can use other plant-based whipped creams made from soy, almond, or oat milk.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe nut-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the almond milk with a nut-free alternative like oat or rice milk.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Vegan gluten-free strawberry shortcake is a delightful dessert that proves you don’t have to sacrifice flavor for dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and a little creativity, you can create a dessert that is both inclusive and indulgent. Whether you’re hosting a summer barbecue or simply craving a sweet treat, this recipe is sure to impress. So, gather your ingredients, roll up your sleeves, and get ready to enjoy a slice of heaven!</p>
