<h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Crisp?</h2>

<p>Choosing a gluten-free version of this classic dessert is not just for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. A gluten-free crisp can be a healthier option for anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake.

<p>Moreover, a gluten-free crisp doesn’t sacrifice flavor or texture. The combination of almond flour and gluten-free oats creates a topping that is just as crispy and delicious as the traditional version. Whether you’re gluten-free by necessity or by choice, this rhubarb strawberry crisp is sure to satisfy your sweet tooth.</p>
