    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). While the oven is heating, peel and slice your fresh peaches. Place them in a baking dish and sprinkle with a little coconut sugar and cinnamon if desired. This will help bring out the natural sweetness of the peaches.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, coconut sugar, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Add the melted dairy-free butter, almond milk, and vanilla extract. Stir until the mixture is well combined and forms a thick batter.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Cobbler</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter evenly over the sliced peaches in the baking dish. Spread it out with a spatula to ensure even coverage. The batter will rise and form a delicious, golden crust as it bakes.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the peaches are bubbling. The aroma of baked peaches and cinnamon will fill your kitchen, signaling that your cobbler is ready.</p>

    <h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cobbler to cool slightly before serving. It pairs wonderfully with a scoop of dairy-free vanilla ice cream or a dollop of coconut whipped cream. Enjoy this gluten and dairy-free peach cobbler warm, and savor every bite!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen peaches instead of fresh ones?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen peaches if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in your cobbler.</p>

        <h3>What other fruits can I use in this recipe?</h3>
        <p>This recipe is versatile and works well with other fruits like berries, apples, or pears. Adjust the sugar quantity based on the sweetness of the fruit you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>This recipe is already vegan as it uses dairy-free butter and almond milk. Just ensure that all other ingredients, like the baking powder, are vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
