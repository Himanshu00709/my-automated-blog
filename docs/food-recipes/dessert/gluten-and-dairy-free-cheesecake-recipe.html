    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to create this delicious gluten and dairy-free cheesecake.</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, melted coconut oil, and maple syrup. Mix until the ingredients are well combined and the mixture resembles a crumbly dough. Press the mixture into the bottom of a springform pan, ensuring it's evenly distributed. Bake the crust for 10-12 minutes, or until it's lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the crust is cooling, prepare the filling. Drain the soaked cashews and add them to a high-speed blender along with the coconut cream, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and maple syrup. Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. This may take a few minutes, so be patient. Once the filling is smooth, pour it over the cooled crust and spread it evenly with a spatula.</p>

    <h3>3. Chill the Cheesecake</h3>
    <p>Place the cheesecake in the refrigerator and let it chill for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. This will allow the filling to set and develop its rich, creamy texture. Once the cheesecake is fully set, remove it from the refrigerator and carefully release it from the springform pan.</p>

    <h3>4. Add the Toppings</h3>
    <p>Before serving, top the cheesecake with fresh berries or any other toppings of your choice. You can also drizzle some melted dairy-free chocolate or a sprinkle of shredded coconut for added flavor and texture.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour for the crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours like oat flour or coconut flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different sweetener?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer, you can use agave syrup, honey, or any other liquid sweetener in place of maple syrup. Just adjust the quantity to taste.</p>

        <h3>How long does this cheesecake last in the fridge?</h3>
        <p>This cheesecake can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container to maintain its freshness.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this cheesecake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze this cheesecake for up to 2 months. To serve, simply thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and add your desired toppings before serving.</p>
