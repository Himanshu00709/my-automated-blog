    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with olive oil and line the bottom with parchment paper. This will ensure that your cake comes out easily after baking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Make sure the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in your batter.</p>

    <h3>3. Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. Gradually add the olive oil, fresh orange juice, orange zest, and vanilla extract. Mix until everything is well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>6. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can dust the top with powdered sugar or drizzle with a simple orange glaze for added sweetness.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of oil?</h3>
        <p>While olive oil adds a unique flavor to the cake, you can use other oils like coconut oil or vegetable oil. Keep in mind that this will alter the taste and texture of the cake.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>The cake can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other citrus fruits to the recipe?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can experiment with other citrus fruits like lemons or limes to create different flavor profiles. Just make sure to adjust the sugar accordingly, as some citrus fruits are more tart than others.</p>
