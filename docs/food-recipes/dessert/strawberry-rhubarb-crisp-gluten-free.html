    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the filling:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the strawberries, rhubarb, granulated sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice. Mix well and transfer to a greased baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the crisp topping:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free oats, almond flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Add the cold butter and use your fingers to work it into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble and bake:</strong> Sprinkle the crisp topping evenly over the fruit mixture. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the crisp to cool for 10-15 minutes before serving. Enjoy warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Crisp</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free strawberry rhubarb crisp turns out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use certified gluten-free oats:</strong> While oats are naturally gluten-free, they can be contaminated during processing. Look for oats labeled "certified gluten-free" to avoid any issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the topping:</strong> The key to a perfect crisp topping is to keep it crumbly. Overmixing can result in a dense, doughy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust sweetness to taste:</strong> If you prefer a sweeter dessert, you can increase the amount of sugar in the filling. Conversely, if you enjoy a more tart flavor, reduce the sugar slightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flours:</strong> Almond flour works well in this recipe, but you can also try other gluten-free flours like oat flour or a gluten-free all-purpose blend.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen strawberries and rhubarb?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries and rhubarb if fresh ones are not available. Just be sure to thaw and drain them well before using to prevent excess moisture in the filling.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make this recipe vegan, substitute the butter with a plant-based alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. Ensure that your sugar is also vegan-friendly, as some sugars are processed with bone char.</p>

        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat the crisp in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the crisp?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked crisp for up to 2 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. To reheat, bake it in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until warmed through.</p>
