    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cranberry Filling</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the cranberries and granulated sugar. Toss them together until the cranberries are evenly coated. If you prefer a sweeter filling, you can adjust the amount of sugar to your taste. Transfer the cranberry mixture to a baking dish and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Crumble Topping</h3>

    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free flour blend, rolled oats, brown sugar, ground cinnamon, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, work the butter into the mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. This crumble topping will give your dessert a delightful texture and flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>

    <p>Sprinkle the crumble topping evenly over the cranberry filling in the baking dish. Make sure to cover the entire surface for a consistent bake. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the cranberry filling is bubbling. Once done, remove the crumble from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>

    <p>This gluten-free cranberry crumble is versatile and can be served in various ways. For a classic presentation, serve it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. If you’re looking for a healthier option, pair it with Greek yogurt or a drizzle of honey. The tartness of the cranberries pairs beautifully with the sweetness of the crumble topping, creating a balanced and satisfying dessert.</p>
