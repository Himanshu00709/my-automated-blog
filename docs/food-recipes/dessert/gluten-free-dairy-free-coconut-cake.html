    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free dairy-free coconut cake:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch round cake pan with coconut oil. Line the bottom with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the coconut flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted coconut oil, coconut milk, eggs, vanilla extract, and maple syrup or honey. Ensure the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a smooth batter forms. Fold in the shredded coconut.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dusting of shredded coconut or a drizzle of coconut cream for added flavor.</p>
