    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started on making the perfect gluten-free blackberry pie. Follow these steps to create a dessert that will impress your family and friends.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Divide the dough into two equal portions, shape them into discs, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the fresh blackberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt. Gently toss the ingredients together until the blackberries are evenly coated. Set the filling aside while you roll out the crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out one disc of dough on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Carefully transfer the dough to the pie dish and press it into the bottom and sides. Pour the blackberry filling into the crust. Roll out the second disc of dough and place it over the filling. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges to seal the pie. Cut a few small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Pie</h3>
    <p>Place the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips and bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Allow the pie to cool completely before serving to allow the filling to set.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Blackberry Pie</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen blackberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blackberries if fresh ones are not available. However, make sure to thaw and drain them before using to prevent the pie from becoming too watery.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What can I use instead of xanthan gum?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have xanthan gum, you can use guar gum or psyllium husk as a substitute. Both work well as binders in gluten-free baking.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make the pie crust ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the pie crust dough up to 2 days in advance and store it in the refrigerator. Just make sure to let it come to room temperature before rolling it out.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

With the right ingredients and a little patience, you can create a pie that's just as delicious as its traditional counterpart.
