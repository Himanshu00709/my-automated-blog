    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making this delicious Gluten-Free Peach Upside Down Cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Peach Topping</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a 9-inch round cake pan, melt ¼ cup of unsalted butter. Once melted, sprinkle ½ cup of brown sugar evenly over the butter. Arrange the sliced peaches in a single layer on top of the brown sugar mixture. Set the pan aside while you prepare the cake batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Cake Batter</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. In a separate large bowl, cream together ½ cup of unsalted butter and ¾ cup of granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with ½ cup of milk, and mix until just combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the cake batter over the prepared peach topping in the cake pan, spreading it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting it onto a serving plate.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the cake is inverted, let it cool slightly before serving. The caramelized peach topping will be on display, making for a stunning presentation. Serve warm or at room temperature, and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use canned peaches instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use canned peaches if fresh peaches are not available. Just make sure to drain them well before using to avoid excess moisture in the cake.</p>

        <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>A 1:1 gluten-free flour blend that contains xanthan gum works best for this recipe. Brands like Bob's Red Mill or King Arthur Flour offer excellent options.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a dairy-free milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>
