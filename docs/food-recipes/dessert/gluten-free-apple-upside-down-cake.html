    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing the Apples</h3>
    <p>Start by peeling and slicing the apples into thin, even slices. In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar and cinnamon together. Arrange the apple slices in a single layer at the bottom of a greased cake pan, and sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over the apples. This will create a caramelized topping once the cake is baked.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Cake Batter</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. In a separate large bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix the batter.</p>

    <h3>3. Assembling and Baking the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the cake batter over the arranged apple slices in the cake pan, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before inverting it onto a serving plate. The apples should now be on top, creating a beautiful and delicious topping.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Apple Upside Down Cake</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Apples:</strong> For the best flavor and texture, use apples that are firm and slightly tart, such as Granny Smith or Honeycrisp.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Good Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Cake Cool Before Inverting:</strong> Allowing the cake to cool slightly in the pan will make it easier to invert without breaking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the apples with other fruits such as pears, peaches, or pineapple. Just make sure to adjust the baking time accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or margarine, and use a dairy-free milk like almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the cake a day in advance. Just make sure to store it properly and warm it slightly before serving.</p>
