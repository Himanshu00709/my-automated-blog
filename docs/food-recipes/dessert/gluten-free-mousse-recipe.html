    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Melt the Chocolate</h3>
    <p>Begin by melting the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water. Make sure the bowl doesn't touch the water, as this could cause the chocolate to burn. Stir the chocolate occasionally until it's completely melted and smooth. Once melted, remove the bowl from the heat and set it aside to cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>2. Whip the Cream</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until it forms soft peaks. Be careful not to over-whip the cream, as it can become grainy. Once whipped, set the cream aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Beat the Egg Whites</h3>
    <p>In another clean bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they become frothy. Gradually add the sugar while continuing to beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. This will give your mousse its light and airy texture.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the melted chocolate into the whipped cream until well combined. Then, carefully fold in the beaten egg whites, making sure not to deflate the mixture. The key to a perfect mousse is to maintain as much air as possible in the mixture.</p>

    <h3>5. Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Divide the mousse mixture into serving glasses or bowls and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until set. Before serving, you can garnish the mousse with fresh berries, a dusting of cocoa powder, or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>

    <h2>Customization Ideas</h2>
    <p>One of the best things about this gluten-free mousse recipe is its versatility. Here are a few ideas to customize your mousse:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flavor Variations:</strong> Add a splash of liqueur, such as Grand Marnier or Amaretto, for an adult twist. Alternatively, you can mix in some espresso powder for a mocha flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> Top your mousse with fresh fruit, crushed nuts, or gluten-free cookies for added texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Dairy-Free Option:</strong> For a dairy-free version, substitute the heavy cream with coconut cream and use dairy-free chocolate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this mousse ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this mousse can be made up to 24 hours in advance. Simply cover it with plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>Is this mousse suitable for vegans?</h3>
