    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free lemon ricotta cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, beat the ricotta cheese and sugar together until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
