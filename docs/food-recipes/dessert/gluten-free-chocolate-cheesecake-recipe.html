    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (160°C). In a medium-sized bowl, combine the crushed gluten-free graham crackers (or cookies) with the melted butter. Mix until the crumbs are evenly coated. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, ensuring an even layer. Bake the crust for about 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Chocolate Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until it’s smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until well combined. Next, add the cocoa powder and mix until fully incorporated. In a separate bowl, melt the semi-sweet chocolate and let it cool slightly. Add the melted chocolate to the cream cheese mixture, followed by the eggs, one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully mixed in before adding the next. Finally, add the vanilla extract, heavy cream, and salt, and mix until the filling is smooth and velvety.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Cheesecake</h3>
    <p>Pour the chocolate filling over the cooled crust in the springform pan. Smooth the top with a spatula. Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 50-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool inside with the door slightly ajar for about an hour. This helps prevent cracking. Once cooled, refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow it to set completely.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>When you’re ready to serve, carefully remove the cheesecake from the springform pan. Slice it into even pieces and garnish with whipped cream, fresh berries, or a drizzle of chocolate sauce if desired. Enjoy your gluten-free chocolate cheesecake with friends and family!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free cookie for the crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free cookie of your choice. Popular options include gluten-free chocolate cookies, almond flour cookies, or even gluten-free shortbread cookies. Just make sure to crush them finely and mix with melted butter as directed.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cheesecake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make this cheesecake dairy-free, substitute the cream cheese with a dairy-free alternative, use dairy-free chocolate, and replace the heavy cream with a non-dairy option like coconut cream. Ensure all ingredients are labeled as dairy-free to avoid any cross-contamination.</p>

        <h3>How long can I store the cheesecake?</h3>
        <p>This gluten-free chocolate cheesecake can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container to maintain its freshness. You can also freeze the cheesecake for up to 2 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add toppings to the cheesecake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize your cheesecake with a variety of toppings. Some popular options include fresh berries, chocolate shavings, caramel sauce, or a dusting of powdered sugar. Get creative and make it your own!</p>
