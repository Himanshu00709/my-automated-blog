    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Melt the Chocolate and Butter</h3>
    <p>Begin by melting the dark chocolate and unsalted butter together. You can do this using a double boiler or by placing them in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water. Stir occasionally until the mixture is smooth and fully melted. Once melted, remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Whip the Egg Whites</h3>
    <p>In a clean, dry bowl, whisk the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they form stiff peaks. This will take about 3-5 minutes with an electric mixer. The stiff peaks are essential for giving the mousse its light and airy texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Egg Yolks</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the granulated sugar until the mixture becomes pale and slightly thickened. This should take about 2-3 minutes. Once done, gently fold the melted chocolate mixture into the egg yolks, ensuring everything is well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Fold in the Whipped Cream</h3>
    <p>In another bowl, whip the heavy cream until it reaches soft peaks. Add the vanilla extract and gently fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture. Be careful not to overmix, as this can deflate the cream and affect the mousse’s texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Everything</h3>
    <p>Finally, fold the whipped egg whites into the chocolate mixture in two batches. This step is crucial for maintaining the mousse’s airy consistency. Once everything is well combined, spoon the mousse into serving glasses or bowls and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until set.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use milk chocolate if you prefer a sweeter mousse. However, keep in mind that milk chocolate has a lower cocoa content, which may affect the richness of the final product.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This particular recipe contains eggs and dairy, so it is not vegan. However, you can make a vegan version by using dairy-free chocolate, coconut cream, and aquafaba (chickpea water) as a substitute for egg whites.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How long can I store the chocolate mousse?</h3>
        <p>The chocolate mousse can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Make sure to cover it with plastic wrap or place it in an airtight container to prevent it from absorbing any odors from the fridge.</p>
