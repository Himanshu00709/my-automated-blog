    <h1>Gluten-Free Apple Cinnamon Cake: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>When it comes to baking, few combinations are as comforting and delightful as apple and cinnamon. Add the health benefits of a gluten-free diet, and you have a recipe that’s not only delicious but also suitable for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Baking?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking has gained immense popularity in recent years, and for good reason. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, avoiding gluten is essential for maintaining good health. However, even those without gluten sensitivities are increasingly opting for gluten-free options due to the perceived health benefits. Gluten-free baking can be just as delicious and satisfying as traditional baking, provided you use the right ingredients and techniques.</p>

    <p>When it comes to gluten-free cakes, the key is to use a blend of gluten-free flours that mimic the texture and structure of wheat flour. Common gluten-free flours include almond flour, coconut flour, rice flour, and tapioca flour. These flours not only provide a gluten-free alternative but also add unique flavors and nutritional benefits to your baked goods.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create a perfect gluten-free apple cinnamon cake:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for creating a tender cake crumb.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla extract for added flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined; overmixing can lead to a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in Apples</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the diced apples, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature, optionally topped with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Apple Cinnamon Cake</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. A blend of almond flour, rice flour, and tapioca flour works well for this recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the butter with coconut oil, use a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) instead of regular eggs, and opt for a dairy-free milk like almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts to the cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, chopped walnuts or pecans make a great addition to this cake. Simply fold them into the batter along with the apples.</p>
