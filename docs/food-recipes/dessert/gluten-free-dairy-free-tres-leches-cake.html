    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Cake Batter</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 ½ cups of gluten-free flour blend, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and a pinch of salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together 4 large eggs, 1 cup of sugar, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract until light and fluffy. Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, being careful not to overmix. Pour the batter into a greased baking dish and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Tres Leches Mixture</h3>

    <p>While the cake is baking, prepare the tres leches mixture. In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of dairy-free condensed milk, 1 cup of dairy-free evaporated milk, and 1 cup of coconut cream. Stir until well combined. Once the cake is out of the oven and has cooled slightly, use a fork to poke holes all over the surface. Slowly pour the tres leches mixture over the cake, allowing it to soak in.</p>

    <h3>3. Chill and Serve</h3>

    <p>Refrigerate the cake for at least 4 hours, or overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and the cake to fully absorb the milk mixture. Before serving, top with a dollop of dairy-free whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon or fresh fruit for added flavor and presentation.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use any gluten-free flour for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend, but for best results, choose a blend that is designed for baking. Almond flour, rice flour, or a pre-mixed gluten-free flour blend work well.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I make dairy-free condensed milk?</h3>
        <p>You can make dairy-free condensed milk by simmering 2 cups of coconut milk with ½ cup of sugar until it reduces by half. This creates a thick, sweet mixture that mimics traditional condensed milk.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this cake ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! In fact, Tres Leches Cake tastes even better when made a day in advance. The longer it sits, the more the flavors develop and the cake becomes even more moist.</p>

        <h3>4. What can I use instead of coconut cream?</h3>
        <p>If you’re not a fan of coconut, you can use cashew cream or another dairy-free cream alternative. Just ensure it has a similar consistency to heavy cream.</p>
    </div>
