<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Apple Filling</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Peel and slice the apples into thin wedges. In a large bowl, toss the apple slices with lemon juice, granulated sugar, and ground cinnamon. This mixture will create a sweet and tangy filling that pairs perfectly with the crumble topping.</p>

<h3>2. Making the Crumble Topping</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, brown sugar, and salt. Cut the cold unsalted butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the vanilla extract to enhance the flavor of the crumble.</p>

<h3>3. Assembling the Crumble</h3>

<p>Transfer the prepared apple filling into a baking dish, spreading it out evenly. Sprinkle the crumble topping over the apples, ensuring an even distribution. The topping should cover the apples completely, creating a golden crust as it bakes.</p>

<h3>4. Baking the Crumble</h3>

<p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the apple filling is bubbling. The aroma of baked apples and cinnamon will fill your kitchen, signaling that your gluten-free apple crumble is ready.</p>

<h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>

<p>Once baked, allow the crumble to cool slightly before serving. This dessert pairs wonderfully with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. The contrast between the warm, spiced apples and the cool, creamy topping is simply irresistible.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute the gluten-free flour blend with other gluten-free flours such as rice flour or coconut flour. However, the texture of the crumble may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Replace the unsalted butter with a plant-based alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan margarine, to make this recipe vegan-friendly.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover apple crumble in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I add nuts to the crumble topping?</h3>
    <p>Yes, adding chopped nuts like almonds or walnuts to the crumble topping can add a delightful crunch and extra flavor.</p>
</div>
