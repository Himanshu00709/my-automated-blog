    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper to ensure the cakes don’t stick.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes with an electric mixer on medium speed.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined; do not overmix.</p>

    <h3>6. Fold in Strawberries</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the chopped strawberries and strawberry puree into the batter. This will give your cake a delightful strawberry flavor and a moist texture.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>8. Cool and Frost</h3>
    <p>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, frost with your favorite gluten-free frosting and decorate with fresh strawberries.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen strawberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries, but make sure to thaw and drain them thoroughly before adding them to the batter. Excess moisture can affect the texture of the cake.</p>

        <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>A 1:1 gluten-free flour blend that contains xanthan gum works best for this recipe. Popular brands include Bob’s Red Mill and King Arthur Flour.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil, and use a non-dairy milk mixed with a teaspoon of vinegar or lemon juice in place of buttermilk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This gluten-free strawberry cake is a perfect dessert for any occasion, whether it’s a birthday, anniversary, or just a weekend treat. With its moist texture, rich strawberry flavor, and beautiful presentation, it’s sure to be a hit with everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions.
