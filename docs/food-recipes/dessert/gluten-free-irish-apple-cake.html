    <h1>Gluten-Free Irish Apple Cake: A Delicious Tradition Reimagined</h1>
    <p>Irish Apple Cake is a beloved dessert that has been enjoyed for generations in Ireland.

    <h2>The History of Irish Apple Cake</h2>
    <p>Irish Apple Cake, also known as "Apple Tart" or "Apple Pie" in some regions, has been a staple in Irish households for centuries.

Fortunately, with the rise of gluten-free baking, it’s now possible to enjoy traditional recipes like Irish Apple Cake without the worry of gluten. By substituting wheat flour with gluten-free alternatives, you can create a cake that is just as delicious and satisfying as the original.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch round cake pan.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cut the cold butter into small pieces and add it to the flour mixture. Use your fingers or a pastry cutter to rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Add the granulated sugar and mix well.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the batter into the prepared cake pan. Arrange the sliced apples evenly over the batter, then sprinkle with cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Spread the remaining batter over the apples, covering them as much as possible.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Dust with powdered sugar before serving, if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>When making gluten-free Irish Apple Cake, there are a few tips to keep in mind to ensure the best results:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking and contains a mix of flours like rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense and tough cake. Mix the batter just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose the right apples:</strong> Tart apples like Granny Smith or Bramley work best in this recipe, as they provide a nice contrast to the sweetness of the cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the cake cool before serving:</strong> Allowing the cake to cool completely will help it set and make it easier to slice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Irish Apple Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit in this cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the apples with other fruits like pears or peaches. Just make sure to adjust the baking time if necessary, as different fruits may release more or less moisture during baking.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and use a dairy-free milk like almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts to the cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add chopped nuts like walnuts or pecans to the batter for added texture and flavor. Just be sure to check for any nut allergies before serving.</p>
