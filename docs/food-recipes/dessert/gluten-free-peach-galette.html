    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Pastry Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by making the gluten-free pastry dough. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, granulated sugar, and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Shape it into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Peach Filling</h3>

    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the peach filling. In a large bowl, toss the sliced peaches with lemon juice, cornstarch, and vanilla extract. The lemon juice will prevent the peaches from browning, while the cornstarch will help thicken the juices as the galette bakes. Set the filling aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Galette</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). On a lightly floured surface (using gluten-free flour), roll out the chilled dough into a rough circle about 12 inches in diameter. Transfer the dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Arrange the peach slices in the center of the dough, leaving a 2-inch border around the edges. Fold the edges of the dough over the peaches, pleating as you go to create a rustic look.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>

    <p>Brush the edges of the dough with a beaten egg and sprinkle with turbinado sugar for a beautiful, golden finish. Bake the galette in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the peaches are tender. Allow the galette to cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>

    <p>A gluten-free peach galette is best served warm, ideally with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. The contrast of the warm, juicy peaches with the cool, creamy topping is simply irresistible. For an extra touch of elegance, you can drizzle a bit of honey or sprinkle some powdered sugar over the top before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Peach Galette</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen peaches instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen peaches if fresh ones are not available. However, make sure to thaw and drain them well to avoid excess moisture, which can make the galette soggy.</p>

        <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best?</h3>
        <p>For the best results, use a gluten-free flour blend that contains xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten. Popular brands include Bob’s Red Mill and King Arthur Flour.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the dough up to 2 days in advance and keep it refrigerated. Just make sure to let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes before rolling it out.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover galette in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 3 months.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>A gluten-free peach galette is a delightful way to enjoy the flavors of summer while adhering to a gluten-free diet. With its buttery, flaky crust and juicy, sweet peach filling, this dessert is sure to become a seasonal favorite. Whether you’re serving it at a summer picnic, a family dinner, or just indulging in a sweet treat for yourself, this galette is a testament to the fact that gluten-free baking can be just as delicious and satisfying as traditional baking.
