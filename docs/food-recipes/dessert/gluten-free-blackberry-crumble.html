    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Blackberry Filling</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the fresh blackberries, granulated sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice. Gently toss the ingredients together until the blackberries are evenly coated. The cornstarch will help thicken the filling as it bakes, while the lemon juice adds a bright, tangy flavor that complements the sweetness of the blackberries.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Crumble Topping</h3>

    <p>In a separate bowl, mix together the gluten-free oats, almond flour, brown sugar, ground cinnamon, and salt. Cut the cold unsalted butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, work the butter into the mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. The butter should be evenly distributed, but you still want some larger chunks for that perfect crumbly texture.</p>

    <h3>3. Assembling and Baking</h3>

    <p>Transfer the blackberry mixture to a greased baking dish, spreading it out evenly. Sprinkle the crumble topping over the blackberries, making sure to cover the entire surface. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Allow the crumble to cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>

    <p>This gluten-free blackberry crumble is delicious on its own, but you can take it to the next level by serving it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. The contrast between the warm, fruity filling and the cold, creamy topping is simply divine. You can also enjoy it with a cup of tea or coffee for a delightful afternoon treat.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>Not only is this gluten-free blackberry crumble delicious, but it's also packed with nutritional benefits. Blackberries are rich in vitamins C and K, as well as antioxidants that help protect your body from free radicals. Almond flour adds a dose of healthy fats and protein, while gluten-free oats provide fiber to keep you feeling full and satisfied. By using natural sweeteners like granulated and brown sugar, you can enjoy a dessert that's both indulgent and wholesome.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen blackberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blackberries if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in the filling.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute almond flour with another type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat it in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this recipe vegan by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative like coconut oil or vegan margarine.</p>
