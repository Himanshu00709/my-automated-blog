    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the glutinous rice flour, tapioca flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. Mix these dry ingredients thoroughly to ensure an even distribution. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a smooth dough forms. The dough should be slightly sticky but manageable.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Shape the Donuts</h3>

    <p>Lightly dust your work surface with tapioca flour to prevent sticking. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball, then flatten it slightly to form a disc. Use your fingers to create a hole in the center of each disc, shaping it into a classic donut form. Alternatively, you can use a donut cutter if you have one.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Fry the Donuts</h3>

    <p>Heat oil in a deep frying pan or pot to 350째F (175째C). Carefully place the donuts into the hot oil, frying them in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry each donut for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they turn golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to remove the donuts from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Toppings (Optional)</h3>

    <p>Once the donuts have cooled slightly, you can add your favorite toppings. Some popular options include a dusting of powdered sugar, a drizzle of chocolate glaze, or a sprinkle of sesame seeds. Get creative and customize your donuts to your liking!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Mochi Donuts</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I bake these donuts instead of frying them?</h3>
        <p>While frying gives the donuts their traditional texture, you can bake them if you prefer a healthier option. Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C) and bake the donuts for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Keep in mind that baked donuts may have a slightly different texture compared to fried ones.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Glutinous rice flour is essential for achieving the chewy texture of mochi donuts. However, if you cannot find tapioca flour, you can substitute it with cornstarch or potato starch. Avoid using regular rice flour, as it will not provide the same texture.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftover donuts?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover donuts in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the donuts for up to a month. To reheat, simply microwave them for a few seconds or warm them in the oven.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free mochi donuts are a delightful treat that combines the best of both worlds: the chewy texture of mochi and the sweet, fluffy goodness of donuts. This recipe is easy to follow and uses simple, gluten-free ingredients, making it accessible to everyone. Whether you're catering to a gluten-free diet or simply looking to try something new, these donuts are sure to impress.
