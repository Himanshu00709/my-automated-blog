<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Pie Crust</h3>

<p>Start by making the gluten-free pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Apple Filling</h3>

<p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the apple filling. In a large bowl, toss the sliced apples with lemon juice, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, and brown sugar. Make sure the apples are evenly coated with the spices and sugar. Set aside to allow the flavors to meld.</p>

<h3>3. Roll Out the Pie Crust</h3>

<p>After the dough has chilled, roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Roll the dough into a circle large enough to fit your pie dish. Carefully transfer the dough to the pie dish, pressing it gently into the bottom and sides. Trim any excess dough from the edges.</p>

<h3>4. Assemble the Pie</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Pour the prepared apple filling into the pie crust, spreading it out evenly. In a small bowl, mix together the gluten-free oats and chopped nuts (if using). Sprinkle this mixture over the top of the apples, creating a crumbly topping.</p>

<h3>5. Bake the Pie</h3>

<p>Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the apple filling is bubbling. If the edges of the crust start to brown too quickly, you can cover them with aluminum foil to prevent burning.</p>

<h3>6. Cool and Serve</h3>

<p>Once the pie is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before serving. This allows the filling to set and makes it easier to slice. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra special treat.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour for the crust?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours such as almond flour or coconut flour, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. It's best to use a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend for the best results.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this pie ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the pie crust and apple filling a day in advance and store them separately in the refrigerator. Assemble and bake the pie when you're ready to serve it.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftover pie?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover pie in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat individual slices in the microwave or oven before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze this pie?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the unbaked pie for up to 2 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. When you're ready to bake, you can place it directly in the oven from the freezer, adding a few extra minutes to the baking time.</p>

Whether you're serving it at a holiday gathering or enjoying a slice with your afternoon tea, this pie is a testament to the fact that gluten-free baking can be just as delicious and satisfying as traditional baking.
