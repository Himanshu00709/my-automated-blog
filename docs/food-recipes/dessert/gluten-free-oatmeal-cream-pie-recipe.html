<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and make cleanup easier.</p>

<h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free rolled oats, gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

<h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugars</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer on medium speed.</p>

<h3>4. Add Egg and Vanilla</h3>
<p>Add the egg and vanilla extract to the butter-sugar mixture. Mix until well combined. The mixture should be smooth and slightly creamy.</p>

<h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough cookies.</p>

<h3>6. Scoop and Bake</h3>
<p>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may still look slightly underbaked, but they will firm up as they cool.</p>

<h3>7. Make the Cream Filling</h3>
<p>While the cookies are cooling, prepare the cream filling. In a medium bowl, combine the marshmallow fluff, powdered sugar, and shortening. Mix until smooth and creamy. If the filling is too thick, you can add a teaspoon of milk to achieve the desired consistency.</p>

<h3>8. Assemble the Pies</h3>
<p>Once the cookies have cooled completely, spread a generous amount of the cream filling onto the flat side of one cookie. Top with another cookie to create a sandwich. Repeat with the remaining cookies and filling.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use regular oats instead of gluten-free oats?</h3>
    <p>While oats are naturally gluten-free, they are often processed in facilities that also handle wheat, barley, and rye, which can lead to cross-contamination. To ensure your oatmeal cream pies are truly gluten-free, it’s important to use certified gluten-free oats.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make vegan gluten-free oatmeal cream pies by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative, using a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) instead of a regular egg, and using a vegan marshmallow fluff.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these oatmeal cream pies?</h3>
    <p>Store the assembled oatmeal cream pies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. If you need to store them longer, you can keep them in the refrigerator for up to a week. Allow them to come to room temperature before serving for the best texture.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze these cookies?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze both the cookies and the cream filling separately. Place the cookies in a single layer in a freezer-safe container, and store the filling in a separate airtight container. When ready to serve, thaw both components at room temperature and assemble the pies.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free oatmeal cream pies are a delightful treat that allows everyone to enjoy a classic dessert without the worry of gluten. With a few simple substitutions and careful attention to ingredient labels, you can create a batch of these soft, chewy, and creamy cookies that are sure to satisfy your sweet tooth. Whether you’re baking for yourself, a loved one with gluten sensitivities, or simply exploring new recipes, this gluten-free version of oatmeal cream pies is a must-try. Happy baking!</p>
