<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the process of making this delectable gluten-free dairy-free peach cobbler.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). While the oven is heating, peel and slice your fresh peaches. Place them in a mixing bowl and toss with a tablespoon of coconut sugar to enhance their natural sweetness.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Make the Batter</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, remaining coconut sugar, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure there are no lumps. Add the melted dairy-free butter, almond milk, and vanilla extract. Stir until the batter is smooth and well-combined.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble the Cobbler</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into a greased baking dish. Arrange the peach slices evenly over the batter. The peaches will sink slightly into the batter as it bakes, creating a beautiful, rustic look.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the peaches are bubbling. The cobbler should be firm to the touch but still slightly jiggly in the center.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Allow the cobbler to cool for about 10 minutes before serving. This dessert is best enjoyed warm, either on its own or with a scoop of dairy-free vanilla ice cream for an extra treat.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Peach Cobbler</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen peaches instead of fresh?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen peaches if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them well before using to avoid excess moisture in the cobbler.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>What can I use instead of almond milk?</h3>
    <p>You can substitute almond milk with any other dairy-free milk, such as oat milk, soy milk, or coconut milk. Each will impart a slightly different flavor, so choose one that complements the peaches.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make this recipe sugar-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use a sugar substitute like stevia or monk fruit sweetener. Keep in mind that this may alter the texture and flavor slightly.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free dairy-free peach cobbler is a testament to the fact that dietary restrictions don’t have to mean sacrificing flavor or enjoyment. This recipe is not only easy to make but also incredibly versatile, allowing you to customize it to your liking. Whether you’re hosting a dinner party or simply craving a comforting dessert, this peach cobbler is sure to impress.
