    <h1>Gluten-Free Zucchini Chocolate Cake: A Healthy Indulgence</h1>

Enter the gluten-free zucchini chocolate cake—a moist, decadent treat that not only satisfies your sweet tooth but also sneaks in some veggies for added nutrition.

When combined with rich chocolate, the result is a cake that’s both delicious and nutritious.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid lumps in the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the vegetable oil and vanilla extract, and mix until fully incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add Zucchini and Chocolate Chips</h3>
    <p>Fold in the grated zucchini and dark chocolate chips. The zucchini will add moisture to the cake, while the chocolate chips will provide bursts of rich flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and serve. For an extra touch, you can dust the cake with powdered sugar or drizzle it with a chocolate glaze.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute regular all-purpose flour for the gluten-free flour blend if you don’t have a gluten intolerance. However, the texture and moisture content may vary slightly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this cake vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make this cake vegan, replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and use dairy-free chocolate chips.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I add nuts to the recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, adding chopped nuts like walnuts or pecans can enhance the texture and flavor of the cake. Simply fold them into the batter along with the zucchini and chocolate chips.</p>
    </div>
