<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chocolate Pie</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>No, regular flour contains gluten, which is not suitable for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Always use gluten-free flour alternatives like almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend.</p>

    <h3>Can I make the pie crust ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the pie crust ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to a month. Just make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.</p>

    <h3>How do I know when the pie is done baking?</h3>
    <p>The pie is done baking when the edges are set, but the center still has a slight jiggle. It will continue to set as it cools. Overbaking can cause the filling to crack, so it's better to err on the side of underbaking.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a different type of chocolate?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can use dark chocolate, milk chocolate, or even white chocolate, depending on your preference. Just make sure the chocolate is gluten-free, as some brands may contain additives that include gluten.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free chocolate pie is a delicious and inclusive dessert that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. Whether you prefer a classic recipe or a vegan version, there are plenty of options to satisfy your chocolate cravings. With the right ingredients and techniques, you can create a gluten-free chocolate pie that is just as indulgent and satisfying as any traditional dessert. So, gather your ingredients, preheat your oven, and get ready to bake a pie that will impress your family and friends!</p>
