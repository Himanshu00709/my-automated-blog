<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making your gluten-free berry cobbler with oats:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your cobbler bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown crust.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Berry Filling</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the mixed berries, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and cornstarch. Toss everything together until the berries are well-coated. The cornstarch will help thicken the berry juices as the cobbler bakes, creating a luscious filling.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Make the Oat Topping</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free rolled oats, almond flour, coconut sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the melted butter (or coconut oil) and stir until the mixture becomes crumbly. This will be your cobbler topping, which will bake into a crispy, golden layer.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Assemble the Cobbler</h3>
<p>Pour the berry mixture into a greased baking dish, spreading it out evenly. Sprinkle the oat topping over the berries, covering them completely. Make sure to distribute the topping evenly for consistent baking.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the berry filling is bubbling. The aroma of baked berries and oats will fill your kitchen, signaling that your cobbler is ready.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Allow the cobbler to cool for a few minutes before serving. You can enjoy it as is, or add a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra treat. The combination of warm berries and crispy oats is simply irresistible.</p>

<h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Berry Cobbler</h2>

<p>To ensure your gluten-free berry cobbler turns out perfectly every time, here are some expert tips:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Certified Gluten-Free Oats:</strong> Not all oats are gluten-free, as they can be contaminated during processing. Always look for oats that are certified gluten-free.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> Depending on the sweetness of your berries, you may want to adjust the amount of coconut sugar in the recipe. Taste your berries before adding the sugar to get the perfect balance.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Berries:</strong> Feel free to mix and match different types of berries. Blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries all work wonderfully in this recipe.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat the cobbler in the oven or microwave before serving.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Berry Cobbler</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen berries?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen berries in this recipe. There's no need to thaw them before baking; just add a couple of extra minutes to the baking time if needed.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with coconut oil or another plant-based fat to make this cobbler vegan-friendly.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of almond flour?</h3>
    <p>If you have a nut allergy, you can substitute almond flour with oat flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend.</p>

    <h3>How do I know when the cobbler is done?</h3>
    <p>The cobbler is done when the topping is golden brown and the berry filling is bubbling around the edges. A toothpick inserted into the topping should come out clean.</p>
