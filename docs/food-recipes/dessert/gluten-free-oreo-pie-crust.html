    <h1>Gluten-Free Oreo Pie Crust: A Delicious and Allergy-Friendly Treat</h1>
    <p>For those who love the rich, chocolatey flavor of Oreo cookies but need to avoid gluten, a gluten-free Oreo pie crust is the perfect solution. Whether you're making a no-bake cheesecake, a chocolate mousse pie, or a classic key lime pie, this crust adds a delightful crunch and flavor that complements any filling. In this article, we'll explore how to make a gluten-free Oreo pie crust, its benefits, and some creative ways to use it in your desserts.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Oreo Pie Crust?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, finding gluten-free alternatives that don't compromise on taste and texture can be challenging. Gluten-free Oreo cookies, which mimic the classic Oreo flavor, provide an excellent base for a pie crust. Not only do they taste great, but they also offer a similar texture to traditional Oreo crusts, making them a fantastic option for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>How to Make a Gluten-Free Oreo Pie Crust</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free Oreo pie crust is simple and requires only a few ingredients. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Quantity</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Gluten-free Oreo cookies</td>
                <td>24 cookies</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Unsalted butter (melted)</td>
                <td>4 tablespoons</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt (optional)</td>
                <td>A pinch</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Crush the Cookies:</strong> Place the gluten-free Oreo cookies in a food processor and pulse until they form fine crumbs. Alternatively, you can place them in a zip-top bag and crush them with a rolling pin.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix with Butter:</strong> Transfer the cookie crumbs to a mixing bowl and add the melted butter. Stir until the crumbs are evenly coated and the mixture resembles wet sand.</li>
        <li><strong>Press into Pie Dish:</strong> Pour the mixture into a 9-inch pie dish. Use the back of a spoon or a flat-bottomed glass to press the crumbs firmly into the bottom and up the sides of the dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill:</strong> Place the crust in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to set. If you're using it for a no-bake pie, it's ready to fill. For baked pies, you can pre-bake the crust at 350°F (175°C) for 10 minutes before adding the filling.</li>
    </ol>
