    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>If you're using a store-bought gluten-free pie crust, follow the package instructions for pre-baking. If you're making your own crust, roll out the dough and press it into a 9-inch pie dish. Pre-bake the crust at 375°F (190°C) for about 10 minutes, or until it's lightly golden. Set aside to cool.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Cream Cheese Layer</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth. Add 1/4 cup of sugar and mix until well combined. Spread this mixture evenly over the bottom of the pre-baked crust.</p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Pumpkin Filling</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, remaining sugar, eggs, heavy cream, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and salt. Mix until smooth and well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Carefully pour the pumpkin filling over the cream cheese layer in the crust. Smooth the top with a spatula. Bake the pie at 375°F (190°C) for 45-50 minutes, or until the filling is set and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>5. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the pie to cool completely on a wire rack before serving. For best results, refrigerate the pie for at least 2 hours before slicing. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream or a sprinkle of cinnamon for an extra touch of indulgence.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Pumpkin Cream Cheese Pie</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Ingredients:</strong> Since this pie relies on simple ingredients, using high-quality pumpkin puree and cream cheese will make a noticeable difference in flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the filling can lead to a dense texture. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill Before Serving:</strong> Allowing the pie to chill in the refrigerator helps the flavors meld and makes it easier to slice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free crust you prefer, such as a nut-based crust or a graham cracker-style crust. Just ensure it's gluten-free if you're catering to dietary restrictions.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this pie ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This pie can be made a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator. It actually tastes better after the flavors have had time to meld.</p>

        <h3>Is this pie suitable for freezing?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the pie for up to 2 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. Thaw in the refrigerator before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a dairy-free cream cheese?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute dairy-free cream cheese if you're avoiding dairy. Just ensure it's a brand that melts and blends well for the best texture.</p>
