    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make this delicious gluten-free carrot cake with pineapple.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Make sure all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the vegetable oil and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add Carrots, Pineapple, and Walnuts</h3>
    <p>Fold in the grated carrots, crushed pineapple, and chopped walnuts (if using) into the batter. Make sure everything is evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it out evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can frost the cake with your favorite cream cheese frosting or enjoy it as is.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh pineapple instead of canned?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh pineapple instead of canned. Simply chop the fresh pineapple into small pieces and use it in place of the canned crushed pineapple. Make sure to drain any excess juice to avoid making the batter too wet.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this cake vegan by substituting the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons of water per egg) and using a plant-based oil instead of vegetable oil. You can also use a vegan cream cheese frosting if desired.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. If you've frosted the cake, it's best to store it in the refrigerator to keep the frosting fresh.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze this cake. Wrap the cooled cake tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. It can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw the cake in the refrigerator before serving.</p>
