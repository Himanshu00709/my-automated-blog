    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Dairy-Free German Chocolate Cake</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the recipe. Follow these steps to create a mouthwatering gluten-free dairy-free German Chocolate Cake:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cake Batter</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round cake pans. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the coconut oil, coconut sugar, almond milk, and eggs (or flax eggs). Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Bake the Cake Layers</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool completely before removing them from the pans.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Coconut-Pecan Frosting</h3>
    <p>In a saucepan, combine coconut milk, coconut sugar, and egg yolks. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and stir in shredded coconut, chopped pecans, and vanilla extract. Let the frosting cool before spreading it between the cake layers.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble and Decorate</h3>
    <p>Place one cake layer on a serving plate and spread a generous amount of coconut-pecan frosting on top. Add the second cake layer and frost the top and sides with the remaining frosting. For an extra touch, drizzle melted dairy-free chocolate over the cake.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Dairy-Free German Chocolate Cake</h2>
    <p>This cake isn’t just a treat for your taste buds—it also offers several health benefits. By using gluten-free flour, you reduce the risk of inflammation and digestive issues for those with gluten sensitivities. Coconut oil and almond milk provide healthy fats and are easier to digest than traditional dairy products. Additionally, coconut sugar has a lower glycemic index than regular sugar, making it a better option for maintaining stable blood sugar levels.</p>

    <div class="faq">
