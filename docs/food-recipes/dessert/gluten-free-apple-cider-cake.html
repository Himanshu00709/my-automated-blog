    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to bake your gluten-free apple cider cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the apple cider. Mix until just combined. Fold in the diced apples.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Apple Cider Cake</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free apple cider cake turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Apple Cider:</strong> Fresh apple cider will give your cake the best flavor. If you can't find fresh cider, you can use store-bought, but make sure it's 100% apple cider without added sugars or preservatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. For this recipe, a blend of almond flour and rice flour works well, but you can also use a pre-made gluten-free flour blend.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense cake. Mix until just combined to ensure a light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> For an extra touch of fall flavor, consider adding a caramel drizzle or a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on top of the cake before serving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make this cake dairy-free by substituting the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter. Just make sure to use a dairy-free option that has a similar consistency to butter.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>While this recipe is designed for gluten-free flour, you can experiment with other flours if you don't need the cake to be gluten-free. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary depending on the flour you choose.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. If you need to store it longer, you can refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months. Just make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil before freezing.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts to the cake?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Adding chopped nuts, such as walnuts or pecans, can add a delightful crunch to the cake. Simply fold them into the batter along with the diced apples.</p>
