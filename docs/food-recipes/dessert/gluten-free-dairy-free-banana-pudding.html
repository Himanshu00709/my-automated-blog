<h1>Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Banana Pudding: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

<p>Banana pudding is a classic dessert that has been enjoyed for generations. However, for those with dietary restrictions, such as gluten intolerance or lactose intolerance, enjoying this creamy treat can be a challenge. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can create a gluten-free and dairy-free version of banana pudding that is just as delicious and satisfying as the original.

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free and Dairy-Free?</h2>

<p>By opting for gluten-free and dairy-free alternatives, you can enjoy your favorite foods without the discomfort or health risks associated with these ingredients. Additionally, many gluten-free and dairy-free recipes are made with whole, unprocessed ingredients, making them a healthier choice overall.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pudding</h3>

<p>In a medium saucepan, whisk together the almond milk, cornstarch, sugar, and salt. Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and comes to a gentle boil. This should take about 5-7 minutes. Once the pudding has thickened, remove it from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Allow the pudding to cool slightly.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Assemble the Layers</h3>

<p>In a serving dish or individual dessert cups, layer the gluten-free vanilla wafers, sliced bananas, and pudding. Start with a layer of wafers at the bottom, followed by a layer of banana slices, and then a layer of pudding. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of pudding on top.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Chill and Serve</h3>

<p>Cover the pudding with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until the pudding is fully set. Before serving, you can top the pudding with dairy-free whipped topping and additional banana slices for garnish. Serve chilled and enjoy!</p>
