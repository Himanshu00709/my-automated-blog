    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing the Shortcake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Add the softened dairy-free butter and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the almond milk and vanilla extract, stirring until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

    <h3>2. Baking the Shortcake</h3>
    <p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) and gently knead it a few times. Pat the dough into a circle about 1 inch thick. Cut the dough into 6-8 wedges or use a round cutter to make individual shortcakes. Place the shortcakes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow them to cool completely before assembling.</p>

    <h3>3. Preparing the Strawberries</h3>
    <p>While the shortcakes are cooling, prepare the strawberries. Wash and hull the strawberries, then slice them. You can toss the sliced strawberries with a little sugar if you prefer them sweeter, but this is optional. Let them sit for about 10 minutes to release their natural juices.</p>

    <h3>4. Assembling the Shortcake</h3>
    <p>Once the shortcakes have cooled, slice them in half horizontally. Place the bottom half on a plate, top with a generous amount of sliced strawberries, and add a dollop of dairy-free whipped cream. Place the top half of the shortcake over the whipped cream and strawberries. Repeat with the remaining shortcakes. Serve immediately and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours like almond flour or oat flour, but keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary. Make sure to adjust the liquid content accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>This recipe is already dairy-free, but to make it fully vegan, ensure that the dairy-free butter and whipped cream you use are also free from animal products. Most store-bought dairy-free whipped creams are vegan, but always check the label.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftover shortcakes?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover shortcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. If you’ve already assembled the shortcakes with strawberries and whipped cream, it’s best to store them in the refrigerator and consume them within 24 hours.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the shortcakes?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked shortcakes for up to 3 months. Wrap them individually in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe bag. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>
