    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornstarch (ensure it’s gluten-free)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (about 3-4 lemons)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter (or a dairy-free alternative)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

        <li>In a medium saucepan, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the milk until the mixture is smooth.</li>
        <li>Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and comes to a gentle boil.</li>
