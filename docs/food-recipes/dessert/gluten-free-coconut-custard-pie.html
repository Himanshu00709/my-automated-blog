    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a Gluten-Free Coconut Custard Pie is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a dessert that will impress your family and friends:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the pie crust:</strong> If you're using a store-bought gluten-free pie crust, make sure it's thawed if frozen. If you're making your own crust, prepare it according to your recipe and press it into a 9-inch pie dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the custard:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract until well combined. Gradually add the coconut milk, whisking continuously to ensure a smooth mixture. Stir in the shredded coconut and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour into the crust:</strong> Pour the custard mixture into the prepared pie crust, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the custard is set and the top is golden brown. You can test the doneness by inserting a knife into the center of the pie; if it comes out clean, the pie is done.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the pie to cool completely before serving. For best results, refrigerate the pie for at least 2 hours before serving to allow the custard to set fully.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Coconut Custard Pie</h2>
    <p>This pie isn't just delicious—it's also packed with nutritional benefits. Coconut milk is rich in healthy fats, which can help improve cholesterol levels and support heart health.
