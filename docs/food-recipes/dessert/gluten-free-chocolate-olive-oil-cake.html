    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free chocolate olive oil cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Beat Eggs and Sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes with an electric mixer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Olive Oil and Vanilla:</strong> Slowly add the olive oil and vanilla extract to the egg mixture, beating continuously until fully incorporated.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Milk:</strong> Stir in the milk (or dairy-free alternative) until the batter is smooth and pourable.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
