<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your cobbler bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown crust.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Blackberries</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the fresh blackberries with 1/2 cup of granulated sugar. Gently toss the berries to coat them evenly. Set aside while you prepare the cobbler topping.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, remaining 1/2 cup of sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the cold unsalted butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Assemble the Cobbler</h3>
<p>Pour the sugared blackberries into a greased 9x9-inch baking dish. Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler topping over the blackberries, spreading it out slightly but leaving some gaps for the fruit to peek through.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the blackberry filling is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
<p>This gluten-free blackberry cobbler is delicious on its own, but you can take it to the next level by serving it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. The contrast of the warm cobbler and the cold, creamy topping is simply irresistible.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen blackberries instead of fresh?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen blackberries if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in the cobbler.</p>

    <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best for this recipe?</h3>
    <p>Any high-quality gluten-free flour blend should work well. Look for one that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten. Popular brands include Bob's Red Mill and King Arthur Flour.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this cobbler dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a dairy-free milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This easy gluten-free blackberry cobbler is a testament to the fact that you don't need gluten to create a delicious, comforting dessert. With its juicy blackberry filling and tender, golden topping, it's a dessert that will please everyone at the table, regardless of dietary restrictions. So, the next time you're craving something sweet, give this recipe a try—you won't be disappointed!</p>
