    <h1>Gluten-Free Wacky Cake: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Wacky cake, also known as "depression cake," is a classic dessert that has been enjoyed for generations. Its unique name comes from the fact that it was created during the Great Depression when ingredients like eggs, milk, and butter were scarce. The cake is known for its simplicity, requiring only a few basic ingredients and no eggs or dairy. But what if you're following a gluten-free diet? Enter the gluten-free wacky cake—a delicious, inclusive version of this beloved treat that everyone can enjoy.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Wacky Cake?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free wacky cake is a variation of the traditional wacky cake that uses gluten-free flour instead of regular all-purpose flour. This makes it suitable for those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or anyone who prefers to avoid gluten. The cake retains its signature moist and fluffy texture, while the gluten-free flour ensures it’s safe for those with dietary restrictions.</p>

    <p>The beauty of this cake lies in its simplicity. It’s made by mixing dry ingredients directly in the baking pan, creating a well in the center, and then adding wet ingredients like oil, vinegar, and water. The chemical reaction between the vinegar and baking soda helps the cake rise, giving it a light and airy texture without the need for eggs or dairy.</p>
