    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the steps to create this mouthwatering gluten-free peach blueberry cobbler.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Fruit Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced peaches, blueberries, granulated sugar, lemon juice, and cornstarch. Gently toss the fruits until they are evenly coated. The sugar will help draw out the natural juices of the fruits, while the cornstarch will thicken the filling as it bakes. Set the fruit mixture aside while you prepare the cobbler topping.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the milk and vanilla extract, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a tough topping.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Transfer the fruit mixture to a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler topping evenly over the fruit. Don’t worry if the topping doesn’t cover every inch—this rustic look is part of the charm. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit filling is bubbling. Allow the cobbler to cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free peach blueberry cobbler is delicious on its own, but you can take it to the next level by serving it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. The contrast between the warm cobbler and the cold ice cream is simply irresistible. For a dairy-free option, consider using coconut milk ice cream or a non-dairy whipped topping.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen fruit instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen peaches and blueberries if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain the fruit before using it in the recipe to avoid excess liquid in the filling.</p>

        <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best?</h3>
        <p>Any high-quality gluten-free flour blend that contains xanthan gum will work well in this recipe. Popular brands include Bob’s Red Mill and King Arthur Flour. If your blend doesn’t contain xanthan gum, you may need to add 1/2 teaspoon to the dry ingredients.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cobbler ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the cobbler up to a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. When you’re ready to serve, simply reheat it in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 15-20 minutes, or until warmed through.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The gluten-free peach blueberry cobbler is a perfect dessert for summer gatherings, family dinners, or even a quiet evening at home. It’s a testament to the fact that gluten-free desserts can be just as indulgent and satisfying as traditional ones. With its juicy fruit filling and tender, golden topping, this cobbler is sure to become a favorite in your recipe collection. So, grab those fresh peaches and blueberries, and get ready to bake a dessert that’s as delightful as it is wholesome.</p>
