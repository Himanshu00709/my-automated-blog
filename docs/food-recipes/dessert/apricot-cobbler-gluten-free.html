    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free apricot cobbler:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the apricots:</strong> In a large bowl, toss the sliced apricots with 1/4 cup of sugar. Set aside to allow the fruit to release its juices.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the topping:</strong> In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, remaining sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut in the cold butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Add wet ingredients:</strong> Stir in the milk and vanilla extract until the dough just comes together. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the cobbler:</strong> Spread the apricots evenly in a baking dish. Drop spoonfuls of the dough over the fruit, covering it as evenly as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Allow the cobbler to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
