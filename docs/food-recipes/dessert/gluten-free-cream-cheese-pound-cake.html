    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free cream cheese pound cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (165°C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Cream Cheese:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter and cream cheese together until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until the mixture is light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 60-70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Pound Cake</h2>
    <p>Here are some expert tips to ensure your gluten-free cream cheese pound cake turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Make sure your butter, cream cheese, and eggs are at room temperature before you start. This ensures a smoother batter and even baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking your cake at the 60-minute mark. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary. Almond flour or coconut flour can be used, but they may require additional adjustments to the recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>To make this cake dairy-free, you can substitute the butter and cream cheese with plant-based alternatives. However, the texture and flavor may differ slightly from the original recipe.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add mix-ins to the batter?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can add chocolate chips, nuts, or even fresh fruit to the batter for added flavor and texture. Just be sure to fold them in gently to avoid overmixing.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The gluten-free cream cheese pound cake is a delightful dessert that proves gluten-free baking can be just as indulgent and satisfying as traditional baking.
