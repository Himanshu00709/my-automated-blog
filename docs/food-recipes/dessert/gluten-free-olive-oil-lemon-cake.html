<h1>Gluten-Free Olive Oil Lemon Cake: A Delightful Treat</h1>

<p>When it comes to baking, the combination of olive oil and lemon creates a harmonious blend of flavors that is both refreshing and satisfying. A gluten-free olive oil lemon cake is not only a delicious dessert but also a healthier alternative for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. This cake is moist, zesty, and packed with the rich, fruity notes of olive oil, making it a perfect treat for any occasion.</p>

<h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Olive Oil Lemon Cake?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free baking has gained immense popularity in recent years, and for good reason. Many people are either diagnosed with celiac disease or have a gluten intolerance, which makes traditional wheat-based baking off-limits. However, gluten-free baking doesn't mean you have to compromise on taste or texture. With the right ingredients and techniques, you can create a cake that is just as delicious, if not more so, than its gluten-containing counterparts.</p>

<p>Olive oil, in particular, is a fantastic ingredient for gluten-free baking. It adds moisture and richness to the cake, ensuring that it doesn't dry out, which can sometimes be a challenge with gluten-free flours. Additionally, olive oil has a distinct flavor that pairs beautifully with the bright, tangy taste of lemon, creating a cake that is both sophisticated and comforting.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with olive oil and line the bottom with parchment paper. This will ensure that your cake comes out easily after baking.</p>

<h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>

<h3>3. Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until light and fluffy. Gradually add the olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, Greek yogurt, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</p>

<h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

<h3>5. Bake the Cake</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>6. Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can dust the cake with powdered sugar or drizzle it with a simple lemon glaze for added flavor.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly. Almond flour adds moisture and a nutty flavor, so if you substitute it, consider adding a bit more liquid to the batter.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can replace the Greek yogurt with a dairy-free alternative like coconut yogurt or almond yogurt. The cake will still be moist and delicious.</p>

    <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
    <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months. Just wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer-safe bag.</p>

    <h3>Can I add other flavors to the cake?</h3>
    <p>Certainly! You can add a teaspoon of lavender or rosemary for a unique twist. Alternatively, you can fold in fresh blueberries or raspberries for a fruity variation.</p>

<p>A gluten-free olive oil lemon cake is a delightful dessert that combines the rich, fruity flavors of olive oil with the bright, tangy taste of lemon. It's a perfect treat for those who are gluten-sensitive or simply looking for a healthier dessert option. With its moist texture and refreshing flavor, this cake is sure to become a favorite in your baking repertoire.
