    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Whisk these dry ingredients together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>3. Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the melted coconut oil, almond milk, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Stir until the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>5. Fold in the Apples</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the diced apples into the batter, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the mixture.</p>

    <h3>6. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>7. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature, optionally topped with a dusting of powdered sugar or a drizzle of dairy-free caramel sauce.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>This gluten-free dairy-free apple cake is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Apples are a great source of dietary fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants, which can support heart health and improve digestion. Coconut oil provides healthy fats that can boost metabolism and support brain function. Almond milk is low in calories and rich in vitamin E, making it a great dairy-free alternative.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>

        <h3>Can I use a different sweetener?</h3>
