    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free mango cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch round cake pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In another bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined. Fold in the mango puree.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Top with fresh mango chunks before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Mango Cake</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free mango cake turns out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Good Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Ripe Mangoes:</strong> The flavor of your cake will depend on the quality of the mangoes. Use ripe, sweet mangoes for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Cake Cool Completely:</strong> Allowing the cake to cool completely before slicing will help it set and make it easier to cut.</li>
    </ul>
