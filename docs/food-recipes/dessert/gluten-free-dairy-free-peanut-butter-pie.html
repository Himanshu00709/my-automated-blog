<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a medium-sized bowl, combine the crushed gluten-free graham crackers with the melted dairy-free butter. Mix until the crumbs are evenly coated. Press the mixture into a 9-inch pie dish, ensuring it’s evenly distributed across the bottom and up the sides. Bake the crust for 8-10 minutes, then let it cool completely.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Make the Filling</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the dairy-free cream cheese until it’s smooth and creamy. Add the peanut butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract, and continue to beat until well combined. Gently fold in the dairy-free whipped topping until the mixture is light and fluffy. Be careful not to overmix, as this can deflate the whipped topping.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble the Pie</h3>
<p>Pour the peanut butter filling into the cooled crust, spreading it evenly with a spatula. If desired, sprinkle dairy-free dark chocolate chips on top for an extra layer of flavor. Cover the pie with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until the filling is set.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once the pie is fully set, slice it into even pieces and serve. You can garnish with additional whipped topping, a drizzle of melted chocolate, or a sprinkle of crushed peanuts for added texture and flavor.</p>

<h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Peanut Butter Pie</h2>

<p>This pie isn’t just a treat for your taste buds—it also offers some health benefits. Peanut butter is a great source of protein, healthy fats, and essential vitamins like vitamin E and magnesium. By using gluten-free and dairy-free ingredients, this pie is easier to digest for those with sensitivities, and it’s also lower in cholesterol compared to traditional pies made with dairy. Additionally, the use of natural sweeteners and wholesome ingredients makes this dessert a healthier alternative to many store-bought options.</p>
