    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free pumpkin mug cake is incredibly simple. Follow these steps for a perfect result:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare Your Mug:</strong> Choose a microwave-safe mug and lightly grease it with cooking spray or a small amount of oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and pumpkin pie spice.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> In the same bowl, add the pumpkin puree, egg, milk, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Mix until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Transfer to Mug:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared mug, ensuring it’s no more than halfway full to allow room for rising.</li>
