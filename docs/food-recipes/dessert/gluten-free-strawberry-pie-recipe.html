<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Pie Crust</h3>

<p>Start by making the gluten-free pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>2. Roll Out the Dough</h3>

<p>Once the dough has chilled, roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Roll the dough into a circle large enough to fit your pie dish. Carefully transfer the dough to the pie dish, pressing it gently into the bottom and sides. Trim any excess dough from the edges and crimp the edges with a fork or your fingers for a decorative finish.</p>

<h3>3. Prepare the Strawberry Filling</h3>

<p>While the crust is chilling, prepare the strawberry filling. In a large bowl, combine the sliced strawberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Mix well to ensure that the strawberries are evenly coated. Let the mixture sit for about 10 minutes to allow the strawberries to release their juices.</p>

<h3>4. Assemble the Pie</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Pour the strawberry filling into the prepared pie crust, spreading it out evenly. If desired, you can create a lattice top with additional dough or simply leave the pie open-faced. If you choose to add a top crust, make sure to cut a few slits in the dough to allow steam to escape during baking.</p>

<h3>5. Bake the Pie</h3>

<p>Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. If the edges of the crust begin to brown too quickly, cover them with aluminum foil to prevent burning. Once baked, remove the pie from the oven and let it cool completely before serving.</p>

<h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Strawberry Pie</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Fresh Strawberries:</strong> Fresh strawberries provide the best flavor and texture for this pie. If fresh strawberries are not available, you can use frozen strawberries, but make sure to thaw and drain them well before using.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Chilling the dough before rolling it out helps prevent it from becoming too sticky and ensures a flaky crust.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> Depending on the sweetness of your strawberries, you may want to adjust the amount of sugar in the filling. Taste the strawberries before adding the sugar to determine how much you need.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the Pie Cool:</strong> Allowing the pie to cool completely before slicing helps the filling set and makes it easier to cut clean slices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use other fruits such as blueberries, raspberries, or a mix of berries. Just adjust the sugar and cornstarch quantities based on the sweetness and juiciness of the fruit you choose.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this pie ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the pie a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. Just make sure to cover it well to prevent it from drying out.</p>

    <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>This recipe can be made vegan by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and ensuring that the sugar used is vegan-friendly.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze the pie?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the pie before or after baking. If freezing before baking, wrap the pie tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil. If freezing after baking, let the pie cool completely before wrapping and freezing. Thaw in the refrigerator before serving.</p>
