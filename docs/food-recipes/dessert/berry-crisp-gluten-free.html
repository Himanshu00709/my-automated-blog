    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free berry crisp:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your berry crisp bakes evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Berries:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the mixed berries with 1/4 cup of coconut sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Toss the berries until they are well-coated, then transfer them to a baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Topping:</strong> In another bowl, mix the gluten-free oats, almond flour, remaining coconut sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Add the melted butter or coconut oil and vanilla extract, and stir until the mixture is crumbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Crisp:</strong> Sprinkle the oat mixture evenly over the berries in the baking dish. Make sure to cover all the berries for a perfect crunch in every bite.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the berries are bubbling.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the berry crisp to cool for about 10 minutes before serving. This helps the flavors meld together and makes it easier to serve.</li>
    </ol>
