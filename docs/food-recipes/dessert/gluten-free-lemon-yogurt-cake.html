    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's walk through the steps to make this gluten-free lemon yogurt cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the yogurt, sugar, eggs, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Oil:</strong> Slowly add the vegetable oil to the wet ingredients, mixing continuously until the mixture is smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Lemon Yogurt Cake</h2>
    <p>To ensure your cake turns out perfectly every time, here are a few tips to keep in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Make sure your eggs and yogurt are at room temperature before mixing. This helps create a smoother batter and a more even bake.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense cake. Mix until just combined to keep the cake light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Gluten-Free Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking to achieve the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Add a Lemon Glaze:</strong> For an extra burst of lemon flavor, consider adding a simple lemon glaze made from powdered sugar and lemon juice. Drizzle it over the cooled cake for a beautiful finish.</li>
    </ul>
