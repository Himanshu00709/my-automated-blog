<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, melted coconut oil, and 2 tablespoons of maple syrup. Mix until the ingredients are well combined and the mixture resembles a crumbly dough. Press this mixture into the bottom of a springform pan, ensuring it’s evenly distributed. Bake the crust for 10-12 minutes, or until it’s lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Make the Filling</h3>

<p>While the crust is cooling, prepare the filling. Drain the soaked cashews and add them to a high-speed blender along with the coconut cream, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and ½ cup of maple syrup. Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. This may take a few minutes, so be patient. The smoother the mixture, the better the texture of your cheesecake will be.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble the Cheesecake</h3>

<p>Once the crust has cooled, pour the filling over it, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Tap the pan gently on the counter to remove any air bubbles. Place the cheesecake in the refrigerator to set for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. This will allow the filling to firm up and develop its signature creamy texture.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Toppings and Serve</h3>

<p>Before serving, top your cheesecake with fresh berries or any other toppings of your choice. Slice and enjoy your dairy-free, gluten-free cheesecake!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour for the crust?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours like oat flour or coconut flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this cheesecake without a blender?</h3>
    <p>While a high-speed blender is ideal for achieving a smooth filling, you can use a food processor as an alternative. Just be sure to blend the ingredients thoroughly to avoid a grainy texture.</p>

    <h3>How long does this cheesecake last in the fridge?</h3>
    <p>This cheesecake can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container to maintain its freshness.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze this cheesecake?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze this cheesecake for up to 2 months. To serve, simply thaw it in the refrigerator overnight. Note that the texture may be slightly different after freezing, but it will still be delicious.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This dairy-free, gluten-free cheesecake is a perfect dessert for anyone looking to enjoy a classic treat without the usual dietary concerns. With a nutty crust and a creamy, tangy filling, it’s a dessert that’s sure to impress. Whether you’re hosting a dinner party or simply treating yourself, this cheesecake is a delightful way to indulge without compromise.
