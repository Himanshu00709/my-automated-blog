    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions to make this delicious gluten-free banana pudding.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pudding Base</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized saucepan, whisk together the milk, granulated sugar, and cornstarch. Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle boil, stirring constantly. Once it thickens, remove it from the heat.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Temper the Egg Yolks</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks. Gradually add a small amount of the hot milk mixture to the egg yolks, whisking continuously to prevent the eggs from curdling. Once the eggs are tempered, pour the mixture back into the saucepan and return it to the heat. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the pudding is thick and creamy.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Butter and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the unsalted butter and vanilla extract. Mix until the butter is fully melted and incorporated into the pudding. Let the pudding cool slightly while you prepare the other components.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Layer the Pudding</h3>
    <p>In a serving dish or individual dessert cups, start by placing a layer of gluten-free vanilla wafers at the bottom. Slice the bananas and place a layer of banana slices over the wafers. Pour a portion of the pudding over the bananas, spreading it evenly. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of pudding on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Whip the Cream</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream and powdered sugar until stiff peaks form. Spread the whipped cream over the top layer of pudding, covering it completely. You can also garnish with additional banana slices or gluten-free wafers if desired.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Cover the pudding with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until it’s fully chilled. This allows the flavors to meld together and the pudding to set. Serve cold and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Banana Pudding</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of milk?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute whole milk with almond milk, coconut milk, or any other non-dairy milk if you prefer. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor of the pudding may vary slightly depending on the type of milk you use.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Gluten-free banana pudding is a great make-ahead dessert. You can prepare it a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator until you’re ready to serve. Just make sure to cover it well to prevent it from absorbing any odors from the fridge.</p>

        <h3>How long does gluten-free banana pudding last?</h3>
        <p>When stored properly in the refrigerator, gluten-free banana pudding can last for up to 3 days. However, it’s best enjoyed within the first 24-48 hours for optimal freshness and texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze banana pudding?</h3>
        <p>Freezing banana pudding is not recommended, as the texture of the pudding and the bananas may change once thawed. It’s best to enjoy it fresh or refrigerated.</p>
