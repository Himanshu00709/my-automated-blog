    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free dairy-free peach cobbler:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Peaches:</strong> Peel and slice the peaches, then place them in a baking dish. Sprinkle with a little coconut sugar and cinnamon if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Batter:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, coconut sugar, baking powder, and cinnamon. Add the almond milk, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Stir until the batter is smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Cobbler:</strong> Pour the batter evenly over the peaches in the baking dish. Spread it out with a spatula to cover the peaches completely.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the peaches are bubbling.</li>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Peach Cobbler</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your peach cobbler turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
