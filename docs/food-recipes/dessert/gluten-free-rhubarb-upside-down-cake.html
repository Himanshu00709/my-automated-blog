<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making this delicious gluten-free rhubarb upside-down cake.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. This will help prevent the cake from sticking and make it easier to flip later.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Rhubarb Topping</h3>

<p>In a small saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add ½ cup of brown sugar and stir until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is bubbling. Pour this mixture into the bottom of your prepared cake pan, spreading it evenly. Arrange the chopped rhubarb on top of the sugar mixture in a single layer. Set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Make the Cake Batter</h3>

<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>

<p>Pour the cake batter over the rhubarb in the prepared pan, spreading it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting it onto a serving plate.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Carefully remove the parchment paper from the top of the cake. Slice and serve warm, optionally with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen rhubarb for this recipe?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen rhubarb. However, make sure to thaw and drain it thoroughly before using to prevent excess moisture in the cake.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>If you don't have a gluten-free flour blend, you can use almond flour or oat flour as a substitute. Keep in mind that the texture of the cake may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and use a dairy-free milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

    <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
    <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>
