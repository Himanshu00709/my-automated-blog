    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Baking Sheet</h3>
    <p>Start by lining a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. This will prevent the toffee from sticking and make it easier to remove once it’s set.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Melt the Butter</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized saucepan, melt the unsalted butter over medium heat. Once the butter has completely melted, add the granulated sugar, water, and salt. Stir the mixture continuously until the sugar has dissolved.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Toffee</h3>
    <p>Continue to cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature. The toffee is ready when it reaches 300°F (150°C), also known as the "hard crack" stage. This process can take about 10-15 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Vanilla Extract</h3>
    <p>Once the toffee reaches the desired temperature, remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Be careful, as the mixture will be extremely hot.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Pour the Toffee</h3>
    <p>Carefully pour the hot toffee mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Use a spatula to spread it evenly. Allow the toffee to cool for a few minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Add Chocolate and Nuts</h3>
    <p>Sprinkle the gluten-free chocolate chips over the warm toffee. As the chocolate begins to melt, use a spatula to spread it evenly across the surface. If desired, sprinkle chopped nuts over the melted chocolate for added texture and flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Let It Set</h3>
    <p>Allow the toffee to cool completely at room temperature or place it in the refrigerator to speed up the process. Once the toffee has hardened, break it into pieces and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Toffee</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Candy Thermometer:</strong> Achieving the right temperature is crucial for the perfect toffee texture. A candy thermometer will help you monitor the temperature accurately.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir Constantly:</strong> Stirring the mixture continuously ensures that the sugar dissolves evenly and prevents the toffee from burning.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> While chocolate and nuts are classic toppings, feel free to get creative. Try adding dried fruit, coconut flakes, or even a sprinkle of sea salt for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>
