    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Pound Cake</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free pound cake turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking, as it will provide the best texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense and tough cake. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the cake cool completely:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be more delicate than traditional cakes, so allow them to cool completely before slicing to prevent crumbling.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Feel free to add your favorite flavorings, such as lemon zest, almond extract, or even chocolate chips, to customize your pound cake.</li>
    </ul>
