<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a 9x9-inch baking dish with butter or a non-stick cooking spray. This will prevent the cobbler from sticking to the dish and make cleanup easier.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Blackberry Filling</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the fresh blackberries, ½ cup of granulated sugar, and lemon zest. Gently toss the mixture until the blackberries are evenly coated. Set aside to allow the flavors to meld while you prepare the topping.</p>

<h3>3. Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, remaining ½ cup of sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a tough topping.</p>

<h3>4. Assemble the Cobbler</h3>
<p>Pour the blackberry mixture into the prepared baking dish, spreading it out evenly. Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler topping over the blackberries, covering as much of the surface as possible. Don’t worry if there are gaps—the topping will spread as it bakes.</p>

<h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the blackberry filling is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let it cool for at least 10 minutes before serving.</p>

<h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
<p>This gluten-free blackberry cobbler is delicious on its own, but you can elevate it with a few simple additions. Serve it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. For a dairy-free option, try coconut whipped cream or a drizzle of almond milk. Pair it with a cup of coffee or tea for a delightful dessert experience.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen blackberries instead of fresh?</h3>
    <p>Yes, frozen blackberries can be used in this recipe. However, make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in the filling.</p>

    <h3>What gluten-free flour works best for this recipe?</h3>
    <p>A blend of gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, rice flour, or a pre-mixed gluten-free all-purpose flour, works well. Avoid using single-grain flours like coconut flour, as they can alter the texture.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Substitute the butter with a plant-based alternative and use a dairy-free milk like almond or oat milk. Ensure your sugar is vegan-friendly as well.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This gluten-free blackberry cobbler is a testament to the fact that dietary restrictions don’t have to mean sacrificing flavor or indulgence. With its juicy blackberry filling and tender, buttery topping, this dessert is a perfect treat for any occasion.
