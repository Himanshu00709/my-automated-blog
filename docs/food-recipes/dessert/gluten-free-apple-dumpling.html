<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and xanthan gum. Cut in the cold butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add cold water, mixing until the dough comes together. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Apples:</strong> Peel and core the apples, leaving them whole. In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Stuff this mixture into the center of each apple.</li>
    <li><strong>Assemble the Dumplings:</strong> Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough into four equal pieces. Wrap each apple with a piece of dough, ensuring the apple is fully covered. Seal the edges by pinching the dough together.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the wrapped apples in a baking dish and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the dough is golden brown and the apples are tender.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Allow the dumplings to cool slightly before serving. Optionally, serve with a scoop of gluten-free vanilla ice cream for an extra treat.</li>
</ol>
