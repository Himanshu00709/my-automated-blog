    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions for making this gluten-free apple upside down cake:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with butter or non-stick cooking spray.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Apple Topping</h3>
    <p>In a small saucepan, melt ¼ cup of butter over medium heat. Add the brown sugar and cinnamon, stirring until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is smooth. Pour this mixture into the bottom of the prepared cake pan. Arrange the apple slices in a circular pattern on top of the sugar mixture, ensuring they cover the entire bottom of the pan.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Cake Batter</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, gluten-free baking powder, and salt. In a separate large bowl, cream together the remaining ¼ cup of butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the cake batter over the arranged apple slices in the pan, spreading it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, carefully invert the cake onto a serving plate. Let it cool completely before slicing and serving. Enjoy your gluten-free apple upside down cake with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours such as coconut flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor of the cake may vary slightly depending on the flour you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative such as coconut oil or vegan butter. Just make sure to use a dairy-free option that has a similar consistency to butter for the best results.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months. To serve, simply thaw the cake at room temperature or reheat it in the oven.</p>
