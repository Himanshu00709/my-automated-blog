<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
<p>Start by making the gluten-free dairy-free crust. In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of gluten-free flour blend with 1/2 cup of cold dairy-free butter. Use a pastry cutter or your hands to mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add 1/2 cup of unsweetened almond milk, mixing until the dough comes together. Roll out the dough on a floured surface and set aside.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
<p>In a large skillet, sauté the mixed vegetables until tender. Add the cooked chicken, 2 cups of gluten-free chicken broth, and seasonings. Stir in 1/4 cup of gluten-free flour blend to thicken the mixture. Cook until the filling is creamy and well-combined.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Pour the filling into a pie dish and cover with the rolled-out crust. Cut a few slits in the top to allow steam to escape. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

<p>This gluten-free dairy-free chicken pot pie is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. The gluten-free crust is easier to digest for those with sensitivities, while the plant-based milk and butter provide healthy fats. The chicken offers a lean source of protein, and the mixed vegetables add essential vitamins and minerals. This dish is a well-rounded meal that’s both satisfying and nutritious.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like almond flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the chicken with a plant-based protein like tofu or chickpeas, and use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze this dish?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the unbaked pie for up to 2 months. When ready to eat, bake it directly from the freezer, adding an extra 10-15 minutes to the cooking time.</p>
