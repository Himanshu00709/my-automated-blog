    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Persimmons</h3>
    <p>Start by peeling and pureeing the ripe persimmons. You can use a blender or food processor to achieve a smooth consistency. Make sure to remove any seeds if present.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the pureed persimmons, melted coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Ensure that the dry ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until a dough forms. If you're adding nuts or chocolate chips, fold them in at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of dough onto a lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve and enjoy!</p>
