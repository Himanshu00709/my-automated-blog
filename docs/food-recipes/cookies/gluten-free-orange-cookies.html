    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free orange cookies:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream butter and sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the unsalted butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add wet ingredients:</strong> Beat in the egg (or flax egg), orange zest, fresh orange juice, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and shape:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Orange Cookies</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free orange cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky, chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before scooping and baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with add-ins:</strong> Feel free to add chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruit to the dough for extra flavor and texture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Orange Cookies</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the cookies to be gluten-free. However, the texture and flavor may differ slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative and use a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) instead of a regular egg.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use bottled orange juice instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>While fresh orange juice is preferred for the best flavor, you can use bottled orange juice in a pinch. Just make sure it's 100% orange juice with no added sugars or preservatives.</p>
    </div>
