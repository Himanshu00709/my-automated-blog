<h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and make cleanup easier.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. This ensures that the dry ingredients are evenly distributed, which is crucial for achieving the right texture in your cookies.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This step is important as it incorporates air into the mixture, resulting in a lighter cookie.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>Add the ricotta cheese, egg, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract to the butter-sugar mixture. Mix until well combined. The ricotta cheese will give the cookies their signature moistness, while the lemon zest and juice will infuse them with a bright, citrusy flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense cookies.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Scoop and Bake</h3>
<p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The cookies should be soft and slightly springy to the touch.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Prepare the Glaze</h3>
<p>While the cookies are cooling, prepare the glaze by whisking together the powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth. Once the cookies have cooled slightly, drizzle the glaze over the top. Allow the glaze to set before serving.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends. However, almond flour is recommended for its ability to add moisture and a tender crumb to the cookies. If you’re allergic to nuts, you can try using oat flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>While ricotta cheese is a key ingredient in this recipe, you can try substituting it with a dairy-free alternative like coconut yogurt or a vegan ricotta. Keep in mind that this may alter the texture and flavor of the cookies.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
    <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. If you want to keep them longer, you can freeze the unglazed cookies for up to 2 months. Thaw and glaze them before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I add other flavors to these cookies?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! While lemon is the star of this recipe, you can experiment with other citrus flavors like orange or lime. You can also add a hint of almond extract or even a sprinkle of poppy seeds for added texture.</p>
