    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to make your gluten-free M&M cookies:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugars:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Egg and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in M&Ms:</strong> Gently fold in the M&M candies, reserving a few for topping the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and Bake:</strong> Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Press a few extra M&Ms on top of each cookie for a colorful finish.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free M&M Cookies</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free M&M cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will provide the best texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix the dough until just combined to ensure a tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too soft, chilling it for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> While M&Ms are the star of these cookies, feel free to add other mix-ins like chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruit for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>
