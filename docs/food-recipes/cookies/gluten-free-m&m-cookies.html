    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free M&M cookies is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create your own batch of delicious cookies:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly and achieve the perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to tough cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the M&M's</h3>
    <p>Fold in the M&M's gently, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the dough. You can reserve a few M&M's to press into the tops of the cookies before baking for a more decorative look.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may look slightly underbaked, but they will firm up as they cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your gluten-free M&M cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free M&M Cookies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t need to avoid gluten, you can certainly use regular all-purpose flour. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, it’s essential to use a gluten-free flour blend to ensure the cookies are safe to eat.</p>

        <h3>Are M&M's gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Most M&M's are considered gluten-free, but it’s always a good idea to check the packaging for any potential cross-contamination warnings. Some specialty M&M's may contain gluten, so be sure to read the labels carefully.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make dairy-free gluten-free M&M cookies by substituting the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter. Just ensure that the M&M's you use are also dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free M&M cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store your gluten-free M&M cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 3 months. Simply thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>
