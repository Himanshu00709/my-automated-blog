    <h1>Gluten-Free Cadbury Egg Cookies: A Delicious Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>When it comes to indulgent treats, Cadbury eggs are a classic favorite. Their creamy, chocolatey center and colorful candy shell make them a beloved treat during the Easter season and beyond. But what if you could combine the irresistible taste of Cadbury eggs with the comforting texture of a freshly baked cookie? Enter gluten-free Cadbury egg cookies—a delightful dessert that caters to those with gluten sensitivities while still delivering the rich, decadent flavors we all crave.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free Cadbury egg cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugars:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the egg and vanilla:</strong> Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the Cadbury Mini Eggs:</strong> Gently fold in the crushed or whole Cadbury Mini Eggs, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free Cadbury egg cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit different from traditional baking, but with a few tips, you can achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough:</strong> If the dough is too soft, chilling it for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with add-ins:</strong> While Cadbury Mini Eggs are the star of this recipe, feel free to experiment with other mix-ins like chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruit.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the cookies to be gluten-free. However, the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>To make these cookies vegan, you can substitute the butter with a plant-based alternative and use a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of a regular egg.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use other types of candy instead of Cadbury Mini Eggs?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Feel free to substitute Cadbury Mini Eggs with other candies like M&Ms, Reese's Pieces, or even chopped chocolate bars.</p>
