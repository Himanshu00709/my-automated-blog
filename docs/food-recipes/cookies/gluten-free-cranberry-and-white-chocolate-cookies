    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugars:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Egg and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Cranberries and White Chocolate:</strong> Gently fold in the dried cranberries and white chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and Bake:</strong> Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>

    <p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll achieve perfect results every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right combination of flours and starches to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix the dough until just combined to ensure a tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too soft, chilling it for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> While cranberries and white chocolate are a classic combination, feel free to experiment with other add-ins like nuts, dark chocolate, or even orange zest for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

        <h3>1. Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
