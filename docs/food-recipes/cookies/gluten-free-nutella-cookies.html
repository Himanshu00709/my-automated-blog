    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create your gluten-free Nutella cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the wet ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate the Nutella:</strong> Gently fold in the Nutella into the dough. Be careful not to overmix, as you want to create a marbled effect.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the cookies:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Leave enough space between each cookie to allow for spreading.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may still look soft, but they will firm up as they cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your delicious gluten-free Nutella cookies!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Nutella Cookies</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free Nutella cookies turn out perfectly every time, here are some expert tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough if necessary:</strong> If your dough is too sticky to handle, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before shaping the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with add-ins:</strong> Feel free to add chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or even a sprinkle of sea salt on top for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Nutella Cookies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don’t need the cookies to be gluten-free. However, the texture and taste may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>2. How should I store gluten-free Nutella cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or margarine. Ensure that the Nutella you use is also dairy-free, or use a similar hazelnut spread.</p>

        <h3>4. Why are my cookies spreading too much?</h3>
        <p>If your cookies are spreading too much, it could be due to the butter being too soft or the dough being too warm. Try chilling the dough before baking to prevent excessive spreading.</p>
