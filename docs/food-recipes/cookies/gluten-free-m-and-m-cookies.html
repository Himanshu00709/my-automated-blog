    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free M&M cookies is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create your own batch of delicious cookies:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add M&Ms:</strong> Gently fold in the gluten-free M&Ms, ensuring they’re evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Leave enough space between each cookie to allow for spreading. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free M&M cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free M&M Cookies</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free M&M cookies turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking and can be used as a 1:1 substitute for all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix the dough until just combined to ensure a tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough:</strong> If you have the time, chilling the dough for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for gluten-free M&Ms:</strong> While most M&Ms are gluten-free, it’s always a good idea to double-check the packaging to ensure they’re safe for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.</li>
    </ul>
