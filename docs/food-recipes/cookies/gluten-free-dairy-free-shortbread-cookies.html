<h1>Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Shortbread Cookies: A Delicious Treat for Everyone</h1>

<p>Shortbread cookies are a classic treat that many of us grew up enjoying. Their buttery, crumbly texture and delicate sweetness make them a favorite for tea time, holiday gatherings, or just a simple snack. However, for those with dietary restrictions such as gluten intolerance or dairy allergies, traditional shortbread cookies can be off-limits. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can create gluten-free dairy-free shortbread cookies that are just as delicious and satisfying as the original.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Shortbread Cookies?</h2>

Similarly, dairy products can be problematic for those with lactose intolerance or a sensitivity to casein, a protein found in milk.</p>

<p>By opting for gluten-free dairy-free shortbread cookies, you can enjoy a treat that is gentle on your digestive system while still indulging in the rich, buttery flavor of traditional shortbread. Plus, these cookies are often made with wholesome, nutrient-dense ingredients that can provide additional health benefits.</p>

<p>Now that you know the key ingredients, let’s dive into the recipe. Follow these steps to create your own batch of gluten-free dairy-free shortbread cookies:</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 ½ cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
    <li>½ cup dairy-free butter substitute (cold)</li>
    <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend and salt.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream together the dairy-free butter substitute and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract if using.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
    <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Roll the dough into a log about 1 ½ inches in diameter. Wrap it in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Slice and Bake:</strong> Once chilled, slice the dough into ¼-inch thick rounds and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Shortbread Cookies</h2>

<p>Creating the perfect gluten-free dairy-free shortbread cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be well on your way to success:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Cold Butter Substitute:</strong> Just like with traditional shortbread, using cold dairy-free butter substitute helps create a crumbly texture. If the dough becomes too warm, chill it before baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flours:</strong> Different gluten-free flours can yield different textures. Almond flour will give a richer, nuttier flavor, while rice flour will be lighter and more delicate.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Flavor Variations:</strong> Feel free to add lemon zest, cinnamon, or even chocolate chips to customize your cookies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Shortbread Cookies</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use coconut flour for this recipe?</h3>
    <p>Coconut flour is highly absorbent and behaves differently than other gluten-free flours. It’s best to use a blend of gluten-free flours or a pre-made gluten-free flour mix for this recipe.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Simply ensure that the sugar you use is vegan (some sugars are processed with bone char) and use a vegan butter substitute.</p>

    <h3>3. How should I store these cookies?</h3>
    <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. For longer storage, you can freeze the dough or baked cookies for up to three months.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I use a different sweetener?</h3>
    <p>While granulated sugar works best for the texture of shortbread, you can experiment with other sweeteners like coconut sugar or maple syrup. Keep in mind that this may alter the texture and flavor of the cookies.</p>
</div>
