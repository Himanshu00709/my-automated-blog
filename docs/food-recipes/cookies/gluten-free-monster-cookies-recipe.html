    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free monster cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free oats, gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugars:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, peanut butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Mix-Ins:</strong> Gently fold in the chocolate chips and M&M's.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and Bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Monster Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free monster cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Certified Gluten-Free Oats:</strong> Not all oats are gluten-free, so make sure to use certified gluten-free oats to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky, chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before scooping and baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Gluten-Free M&M's:</strong> Some M&M's may contain gluten, so double-check the packaging to ensure they are gluten-free.</li>
    </ul>
