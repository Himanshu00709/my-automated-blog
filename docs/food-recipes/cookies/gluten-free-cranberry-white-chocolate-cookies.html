    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free cranberry white chocolate cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugars:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Egg and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Cranberries and White Chocolate:</strong> Gently fold in the dried cranberries and white chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and Bake:</strong> Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free cranberry white chocolate cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that is specifically designed for baking to achieve the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined to keep them tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too soft, chilling it for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent spreading.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Baking Time:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so keep an eye on your cookies and adjust the baking time as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh cranberries instead of dried?</h3>
        <p>While dried cranberries are recommended for this recipe, you can use fresh cranberries if you prefer. Keep in mind that fresh cranberries have a higher moisture content, which may affect the texture of the cookies. You may need to adjust the baking time slightly.</p>

        <p>Yes, you can substitute white chocolate with dark chocolate if you prefer a richer, less sweet flavor. The cookies will still be delicious, but the flavor profile will be different.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 3 months. Just make sure to thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Are these cookies suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe contains butter and eggs, which are not vegan. However, you can make vegan substitutions by using plant-based butter and a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water).</p>
