    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten and dairy-free cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly and achieve the perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir well to ensure that the ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the melted coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir until a dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, you can add a bit more almond flour to achieve the desired consistency.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Chocolate Chips</h3>
    <p>Fold in the dark chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Shape the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or your hands, scoop out small portions of the dough and shape them into balls. Place the balls onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving enough space between each cookie to allow for spreading.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Keep an eye on them to prevent over-baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten and dairy-free cookies with a glass of almond milk or your favorite dairy-free beverage!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten and Dairy-Free Cookies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours such as oat flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Keep in mind that different flours may alter the texture and flavor of the cookies.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute the coconut oil?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can use other dairy-free fats like avocado oil or vegan butter as a substitute for coconut oil. Just make sure to adjust the quantity if necessary.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Are these cookies suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Yes, as long as you use dairy-free chocolate chips, these cookies are completely vegan-friendly.</p>
