    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free eggnog cookies is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create a batch of delicious, holiday-inspired treats:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugars:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the wet ingredients:</strong> Beat in the egg, followed by the eggnog and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dough:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Eggnog Cookies</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free eggnog cookies turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough if needed:</strong> If your dough is too sticky to handle, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before scooping.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the spices:</strong> Feel free to adjust the amount of nutmeg and cinnamon to suit your taste preferences.</li>
    </ul>
