<h1>Gluten-Free Gooey Butter Cookies: A Delicious Treat for Everyone</h1>

<p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular as more people discover the benefits of a gluten-free diet, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference. Among the many gluten-free treats available, gluten-free gooey butter cookies stand out as a delightful indulgence. These cookies are soft, chewy, and irresistibly gooey, making them a perfect dessert for any occasion. In this blog post, we’ll explore the history of gooey butter cookies, how to make them gluten-free, and why they’re a must-try for anyone looking to enjoy a sweet treat without the gluten.</p>

<h2>The History of Gooey Butter Cookies</h2>

<p>Gooey butter cookies have their roots in St. Louis, Missouri, where they were first created in the 1930s. The story goes that a baker accidentally mixed up the proportions of ingredients while making a coffee cake, resulting in a gooey, buttery dessert that quickly became a local favorite. Over time, the recipe evolved into the gooey butter cookies we know and love today. Traditionally, these cookies are made with wheat flour, but with the rise of gluten-free diets, bakers have adapted the recipe to create a gluten-free version that’s just as delicious.</p>

<h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including damage to the small intestine. Others may have non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which can cause symptoms like bloating, headaches, and fatigue. Even for those without gluten-related health concerns, a gluten-free diet can offer benefits such as improved digestion and increased energy levels. Gluten-free gooey butter cookies allow everyone to enjoy this classic treat without the worry of gluten-related issues.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, cream cheese, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt.</li>
    <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms.</li>
    <li>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, portion out the dough and roll it into balls.</li>
    <li>Roll each ball in powdered sugar until fully coated, then place them on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden but the centers are still soft.</li>
    <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Gooey Butter Cookies</h2>

<p>To ensure your gluten-free gooey butter cookies turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture and flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill the dough if necessary:</strong> If the dough is too sticky to handle, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before rolling it into balls.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t overbake:</strong> The cookies should be soft and gooey in the center. Overbaking will result in dry, crumbly cookies.</li>
</ul>
