    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Brown the Butter</h3>
    <p>Start by browning the butter. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter turns a golden brown color and gives off a nutty aroma. This process usually takes about 5-7 minutes. Be careful not to burn the butter. Once browned, remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the browned butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Mix until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>3. Combine the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. If you're using chocolate chips, fold them into the dough at this stage.</p>

    <h3>4. Chill the Dough</h3>
    <p>Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Chilling the dough helps to firm it up and prevents the cookies from spreading too much during baking.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Brown Butter Cookies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Good Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Skip the Chilling Step:</strong> Chilling the dough is crucial for achieving the right texture. It helps the cookies hold their shape and prevents them from spreading too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> While chocolate chips are a classic choice, feel free to get creative with other add-ins like nuts, dried fruit, or even a sprinkle of sea salt on top.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular butter instead of browning it?</h3>
        <p>While you can use regular butter, browning the butter adds a unique, nutty flavor that really sets these cookies apart. It's worth the extra step!</p>

        <h3>What gluten-free flour blend do you recommend?</h3>
        <p>There are many great gluten-free flour blends available, such as Bob's Red Mill 1-to-1 Baking Flour or King Arthur Flour Gluten-Free Measure for Measure. These blends are designed to mimic the texture of all-purpose flour and work well in most recipes.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or a plant-based butter. However, keep in mind that the flavor profile will be slightly different.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the dough or baked cookies for longer storage.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free brown butter cookies are a delightful treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions. The rich, nutty flavor of the brown butter combined with the chewy texture of the cookies makes them a standout dessert. With just a few simple ingredients and easy-to-follow steps, you can whip up a batch of these cookies in no time.
