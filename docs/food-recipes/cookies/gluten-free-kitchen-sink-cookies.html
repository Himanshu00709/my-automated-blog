    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Kitchen Sink Cookies</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free kitchen sink cookies is a straightforward process, but it does require some attention to detail to ensure the best results. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together your gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream together the butter (or coconut oil) and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs (or flax eggs) and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Mix-Ins:</strong> Fold in your chosen mix-ins, such as chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruits, oats, and pretzels or potato chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and Bake:</strong> Use a cookie scoop or spoon to drop dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free kitchen sink cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Kitchen Sink Cookies</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of flours and starches for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Mix-Ins:</strong> The beauty of kitchen sink cookies is their versatility. Feel free to experiment with different combinations of mix-ins to find your perfect cookie.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If your dough is too soft, consider chilling it for 30 minutes before baking. This will help the cookies hold their shape.</li>
    </ul>
