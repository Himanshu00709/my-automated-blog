    <h2>Recipe: Classic Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, Nut-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>

    <p>Here’s a simple and delicious recipe for allergen-free chocolate chip cookies:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup coconut oil, melted</li>
        <li>¾ cup coconut sugar</li>
        <li>1 flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed + 3 tablespoons water)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ cup dairy-free chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix the melted coconut oil and coconut sugar until well combined. Add the flax egg and vanilla extract, and mix again.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until a dough forms. Fold in the dairy-free chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Allergen-Free Cookies</h2>

    <p>Baking allergen-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be well on your way to success:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Measure Accurately:</strong> Gluten-free flours can be denser than traditional flours, so accurate measurements are crucial.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky, chilling it for 30 minutes can make it easier to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add spices like cinnamon or nutmeg, or mix in dried fruit for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>

        <p>You can use other dairy-free fats like vegan butter or olive oil. However, keep in mind that this may alter the flavor and texture of the cookies.</p>

        <h3>Are these cookies suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Yes, as long as you use vegan chocolate chips and a plant-based sweetener, these cookies are entirely vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>
