    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free pumpkin snickerdoodle cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream butter and sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add wet ingredients:</strong> Beat in the pumpkin puree, egg, vanilla extract, and pumpkin pie spice until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the cookies:</strong> Scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of dough and roll them into balls. Roll each ball in the cinnamon sugar mixture until fully coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the dough balls on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pumpkin Snickerdoodle Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky to handle, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before shaping the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust baking time:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so keep an eye on your cookies and adjust the baking time as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute regular all-purpose flour for the gluten-free flour blend if you don't need the cookies to be gluten-free. However, the texture may be slightly different.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the cookie dough?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can freeze the dough for up to 3 months. Simply shape the dough into balls, roll them in cinnamon sugar, and place them on a baking sheet to freeze. Once frozen, transfer the dough balls to a freezer-safe bag. When ready to bake, you can bake them directly from frozen, adding a couple of extra minutes to the baking time.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the baked cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the baked cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin puree?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh pumpkin puree, but make sure it's well-drained and has a similar consistency to canned pumpkin puree. Too much moisture can affect the texture of the cookies.</p>
    </div>
