    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get baking! Follow these simple steps to create your own batch of gluten-free chai cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and make cleanup easier.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, oat flour, coconut sugar, chai spice mix, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these ingredients together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted coconut oil, vanilla extract, and egg. Once mixed, pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until a dough forms.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Shape the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a tablespoon or a cookie scoop, portion out the dough and roll it into balls. Place the balls onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving enough space between each one to allow for spreading.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Keep an eye on them, as gluten-free cookies can brown quickly.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your gluten-free chai cookies with a cup of tea or coffee!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chai Cookies</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like rice flour or buckwheat flour. However, keep in mind that different flours may alter the texture and flavor of the cookies.</p>

        <h3>2. Are these cookies suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe includes an egg, which is not vegan. However, you can substitute the egg with a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) to make the cookies vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I add nuts or chocolate chips?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Feel free to add chopped nuts, chocolate chips, or even dried fruit to the dough for added texture and flavor.</p>
    </div>
