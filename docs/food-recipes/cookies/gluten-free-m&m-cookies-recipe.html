<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that we have all the ingredients ready, let's move on to the step-by-step instructions to make these gluten-free M&M cookies:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you're ready to bake the cookies.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. This helps to evenly distribute the leavening agent and salt throughout the flour, ensuring a consistent texture in your cookies.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugars</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened unsalted butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This process incorporates air into the butter, which helps to create a tender cookie.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Egg and Vanilla</h3>
<p>Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined. The egg acts as a binder, while the vanilla extract adds a rich flavor to the cookies.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to tough cookies.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Fold in M&M Candies</h3>
<p>Gently fold in the M&M candies until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough. This ensures that each cookie has a colorful and tasty surprise in every bite.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Scoop and Bake</h3>
<p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</p>

<h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your delicious gluten-free M&M cookies!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the cookies to be gluten-free. However, if you or someone you're baking for has a gluten intolerance or celiac disease, it's important to stick with gluten-free flour.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a different type of candy instead of M&Ms?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute M&Ms with other candies like chocolate chips, Reese's Pieces, or even chopped nuts. Just make sure the candies you choose are gluten-free if needed.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
    <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. You can also freeze the dough or baked cookies for longer storage. If freezing the dough, scoop it into balls and freeze on a baking sheet before transferring to a freezer bag. Bake from frozen, adding a couple of extra minutes to the baking time.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make these cookies vegan by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of a regular egg. Make sure to use vegan-friendly M&Ms or another type of candy.</p>
