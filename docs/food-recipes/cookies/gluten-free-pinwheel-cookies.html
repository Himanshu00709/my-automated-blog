<h1>Gluten-Free Pinwheel Cookies: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>

<p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular as more people discover the benefits of a gluten-free diet, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply a desire for healthier eating options. Among the many gluten-free treats available, pinwheel cookies stand out as a visually stunning and delicious option. These cookies, with their distinctive swirls of color and flavor, are not only a feast for the eyes but also a delight for the taste buds. In this article, we'll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free pinwheel cookies, from their history to how you can make them at home.</p>

<h2>The History of Pinwheel Cookies</h2>

<p>Pinwheel cookies have a rich history that dates back to the early 20th century. Originally, these cookies were made with traditional wheat flour, but as the demand for gluten-free options grew, bakers began experimenting with alternative flours. The result is a cookie that retains the classic pinwheel appearance but is safe for those who need to avoid gluten. The key to their unique look lies in the technique of rolling two different colored doughs together, creating a spiral pattern that is both beautiful and delicious.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Pinwheel Cookies?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free pinwheel cookies are an excellent choice for anyone looking to enjoy a sweet treat without the discomfort that gluten can cause. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, these cookies offer a safe and delicious alternative to traditional baked goods. Additionally, gluten-free baking often incorporates a variety of nutrient-rich flours, such as almond flour, coconut flour, or oat flour, which can add extra nutritional value to your cookies. Plus, the vibrant colors and flavors of pinwheel cookies make them a hit at parties, holidays, and family gatherings.</p>

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Pinwheel Cookies</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free pinwheel cookies at home is easier than you might think. The process involves creating two different colored doughs, rolling them together, and slicing them into individual cookies. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined. Gradually add the gluten-free flour blend, mixing until a smooth dough forms.</li>
    <li><strong>Divide the Dough:</strong> Divide the dough into two equal portions. If you want to create a chocolate swirl, mix cocoa powder into one portion of the dough. For a colorful swirl, add a few drops of food coloring to the other portion and mix until the color is evenly distributed.</li>
    <li><strong>Roll the Dough:</strong> Roll each portion of dough into a rectangle of equal size, about 1/4 inch thick. Place one rectangle on top of the other, then carefully roll them together into a log. Wrap the log in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to firm up.</li>
    <li><strong>Slice and Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Remove the dough log from the refrigerator and slice it into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Place the rounds on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
