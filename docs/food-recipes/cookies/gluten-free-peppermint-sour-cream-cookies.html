    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free peppermint sour cream cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> Beat in the egg, followed by the sour cream and peppermint extract. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Peppermint Candies:</strong> Gently fold in the crushed peppermint candies, reserving a small amount for topping the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and Bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle the tops with the reserved crushed peppermint candies. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined to ensure a tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too soft, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before scooping and baking. This will help the cookies hold their shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch the Baking Time:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can brown quickly, so keep an eye on them to prevent overbaking.</li>
    </ul>
