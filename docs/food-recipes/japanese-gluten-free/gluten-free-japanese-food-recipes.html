<h2>Gluten-Free Japanese Recipes</h2>

<h3>1. Gluten-Free Sushi Rolls</h3>

<p>Sushi is one of the most iconic Japanese dishes, and making it gluten-free is easier than you might think. The key is to use gluten-free soy sauce (tamari) and ensure that all other ingredients, such as imitation crab or sauces, are also gluten-free. Here’s a simple recipe for gluten-free sushi rolls:</p>

<ul>
    <li>2 cups sushi rice</li>
    <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
    <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>Nori (seaweed sheets)</li>
    <li>Fillings of your choice (e.g., cucumber, avocado, cooked shrimp, or smoked salmon)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Rinse the sushi rice until the water runs clear. Cook the rice with water in a rice cooker or on the stove.</li>
    <li>In a small saucepan, heat the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until dissolved. Mix this into the cooked rice and let it cool.</li>
    <li>Place a nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Spread a thin layer of rice over the nori, leaving a small border at the top.</li>
    <li>Add your fillings in a line across the rice. Roll the sushi tightly using the mat, then slice into pieces with a sharp knife.</li>
    <li>Serve with gluten-free tamari and pickled ginger.</li>
</ol>

<h3>2. Gluten-Free Tempura</h3>

<p>Tempura is a popular Japanese dish consisting of battered and deep-fried vegetables or seafood. To make it gluten-free, simply replace the traditional wheat flour with a gluten-free flour blend. Here’s how:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1 cup gluten-free flour blend</li>
    <li>1 cup ice-cold sparkling water</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>Assorted vegetables (e.g., sweet potato, zucchini, bell peppers) or seafood (e.g., shrimp, squid)</li>
    <li>Oil for frying</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350°F (175°C).</li>
    <li>In a bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, sparkling water, and egg until just combined. The batter should be lumpy.</li>
    <li>Dip the vegetables or seafood into the batter, then carefully place them in the hot oil. Fry until golden brown and crispy.</li>
    <li>Drain on paper towels and serve with gluten-free tempura dipping sauce made from tamari, mirin, and dashi.</li>
</ol>

<h3>3. Gluten-Free Miso Soup</h3>

<p>Miso soup is a staple in Japanese cuisine, and it’s naturally gluten-free if you use gluten-free miso paste. Here’s a simple recipe:</p>

<ul>
    <li>4 cups dashi (made from kombu and bonito flakes)</li>
    <li>3 tbsp gluten-free miso paste</li>
    <li>1 cup tofu, cubed</li>
    <li>2 green onions, sliced</li>
    <li>1 cup seaweed (wakame), rehydrated</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the dashi in a pot until it’s just about to boil.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, mix the miso paste with a little hot dashi to dissolve it, then add it back to the pot.</li>
    <li>Add the tofu, green onions, and seaweed. Simmer for a few minutes until heated through.</li>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
