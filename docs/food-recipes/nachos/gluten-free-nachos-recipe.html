    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This will ensure that your nachos are evenly heated and the cheese melts perfectly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Arrange the Tortilla Chips</h3>
    <p>Spread a single layer of gluten-free tortilla chips on a large baking sheet or oven-safe dish. Make sure the chips are evenly distributed to ensure every bite is loaded with toppings.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Toppings</h3>
    <p>Sprinkle the shredded cheese evenly over the tortilla chips. If you’re using cooked ground beef or chicken, add it on top of the cheese. Next, layer on the black beans, diced tomatoes, and jalapeños. Feel free to get creative with your toppings—nachos are all about customization!</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Nachos</h3>
    <p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is fully melted and bubbly. Keep an eye on the nachos to prevent them from burning.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add Fresh Toppings</h3>
    <p>Once the nachos are out of the oven, add the fresh toppings like guacamole, sour cream, salsa, and chopped cilantro. These toppings add a burst of freshness and flavor to your dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve your gluten-free nachos immediately while they’re still warm and the cheese is gooey. Pair them with your favorite gluten-free beverage, and enjoy!</p>
