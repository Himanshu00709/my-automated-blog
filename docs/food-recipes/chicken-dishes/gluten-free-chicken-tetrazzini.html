<h1>Gluten-Free Chicken Tetrazzini: A Comfort Food Classic</h1>

<p>Chicken Tetrazzini is a beloved comfort food dish that combines tender chicken, creamy sauce, and pasta into a hearty casserole. Traditionally, this dish is made with wheat-based pasta and flour for the sauce, which can be problematic for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. However, with a few simple substitutions, you can enjoy a delicious gluten-free version of this classic dish. In this article, we’ll explore the history of Chicken Tetrazzini, provide a step-by-step recipe for a gluten-free version, and answer some frequently asked questions about gluten-free cooking.</p>

<h2>The History of Chicken Tetrazzini</h2>

<p>Chicken Tetrazzini is named after the famous Italian opera singer Luisa Tetrazzini, who was known for her powerful voice and larger-than-life personality. The dish is said to have been created in her honor in the early 20th century, and it quickly became a popular comfort food in the United States. The original recipe typically includes chicken, mushrooms, and spaghetti, all baked in a creamy sauce made with butter, flour, and cheese. Over the years, variations of the dish have emerged, but the core elements remain the same.</p>

<h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

By opting for gluten-free alternatives, those with gluten-related disorders can enjoy their favorite dishes without the negative health effects. Additionally, many people without gluten sensitivities choose to go gluten-free for its potential health benefits, such as improved digestion and reduced inflammation.</p>
