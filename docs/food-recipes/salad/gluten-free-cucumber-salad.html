    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to prepare your gluten-free cucumber salad:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Wash and Slice the Cucumbers:</strong> Start by thoroughly washing the cucumbers. You can peel them if you prefer, but leaving the skin on adds extra nutrients and a nice crunch. Slice the cucumbers thinly, either using a knife or a mandoline slicer.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Red Onion:</strong> Peel and thinly slice the red onion. If you find raw onion too strong, you can soak the slices in cold water for about 10 minutes to mellow the flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Chop the Dill:</strong> Fresh dill adds a wonderful aroma and flavor to the salad. Chop it finely and set it aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Dressing:</strong> In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, apple cider vinegar, salt, and black pepper. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced cucumbers, red onion, and chopped dill. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently to ensure everything is well-coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Optional Ingredients:</strong> If you’re using feta cheese, crumble it over the salad just before serving. This adds a creamy texture and a tangy flavor that complements the freshness of the cucumbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Your gluten-free cucumber salad is ready to be served! It’s best enjoyed fresh, but you can refrigerate it for a couple of hours to let the flavors meld together.</li>
    </ol>
