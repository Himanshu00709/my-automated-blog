    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making this gluten-free Italian dressing is incredibly simple. Follow these steps to create a flavorful dressing that will enhance your meals:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Combine the Ingredients:</strong> In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, and fresh lemon juice. These ingredients form the base of your dressing and provide a tangy, zesty flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Aromatics:</strong> Stir in the minced garlic and Dijon mustard. The garlic adds a robust flavor, while the mustard helps emulsify the dressing, giving it a smooth consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate the Herbs:</strong> Add the dried oregano, basil, thyme, salt, and black pepper. These herbs are the hallmark of Italian dressing, providing that classic Mediterranean taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweeten (Optional):</strong> If you prefer a slightly sweeter dressing, add a teaspoon of honey or maple syrup. This step is optional but can help balance the acidity of the vinegar and lemon juice.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk Thoroughly:</strong> Whisk all the ingredients together until well combined. You can also use a blender or food processor for a smoother texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Taste and Adjust:</strong> Taste the dressing and adjust the seasoning if necessary. You can add more salt, pepper, or herbs to suit your preference.</li>
        <li><strong>Store:</strong> Transfer the dressing to a glass jar or bottle with a tight-fitting lid. Store it in the refrigerator for up to one week. Shake well before each use.</li>
    </ol>
