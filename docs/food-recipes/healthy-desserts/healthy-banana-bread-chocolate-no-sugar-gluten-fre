    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a loaf pan with parchment paper or lightly grease it to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mash the Bananas</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until smooth. The bananas should be soft and easy to mash, which will help create a moist bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs, almond milk, and vanilla extract to the mashed bananas. Mix well until all the ingredients are fully combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the almond flour and baking powder to the wet mixture. Stir until just combined, being careful not to overmix. Overmixing can lead to a dense bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fold in Chocolate Chips</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the dark chocolate chips, reserving a few to sprinkle on top of the bread before baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips on top. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the banana bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve!</p>
