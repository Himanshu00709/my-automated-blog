<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Ingredients</h3>
<p>Before you start, ensure all your ingredients are measured and ready to go. This will make the process smoother and more enjoyable.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond butter, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract. Stir until the mixture is smooth and well-combined.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Next, add the gluten-free oats, protein powder, and chia seeds to the wet mixture. Stir until all the ingredients are evenly distributed. If the mixture feels too dry, you can add a little more almond butter or honey to achieve the desired consistency.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Incorporate the Chocolate Chips</h3>
<p>Fold in the dark chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the mixture. This will add a delightful burst of flavor to each bite.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Form the Protein Balls</h3>
<p>Using your hands, scoop out small portions of the mixture and roll them into balls. Each ball should be about the size of a tablespoon. If the mixture sticks to your hands, you can lightly wet them with water to make the process easier.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Chill the Protein Balls</h3>
<p>Place the formed protein balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Refrigerate them for at least 30 minutes to allow them to set. This will also enhance their flavor and texture.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once chilled, your gluten-free protein balls are ready to eat! Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week, or freeze them for longer storage.</p>

<h2>Customization Tips</h2>

<p>One of the best things about this recipe is its versatility. Here are some ideas to customize your gluten-free protein balls:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Nut-Free Option:</strong> Replace almond butter with sunflower seed butter for a nut-free version.</li>

    <li><strong>Add-Ins:</strong> Consider adding dried fruits, coconut flakes, or nuts for extra texture and flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Sweetness Level:</strong> Adjust the amount of honey or maple syrup to suit your taste preferences.</li>
