    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Stir in the shredded cheddar cheese and any optional ingredients, such as garlic powder or chives.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the milk, stirring until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a few times. Pat the dough into a 1-inch thick circle.</li>
        <li>Use a biscuit cutter or a glass to cut out biscuits and place them on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Allow the biscuits to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy warm with butter or your favorite spread!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cheese Biscuits</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free cheese biscuits turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use cold butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for creating flaky layers in your biscuits. If the butter melts before baking, the biscuits may become dense.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough biscuits. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Feel free to add your favorite herbs, spices, or even a bit of heat with jalapeños to customize the flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Gluten-free biscuits are best enjoyed fresh, but they can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven for a few minutes to restore their fluffiness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

        <h3>Are gluten-free cheese biscuits keto-friendly?</h3>
        <p>It depends on the ingredients you use. If you opt for low-carb flours like almond or coconut flour and use a keto-friendly milk alternative, these biscuits can easily fit into a keto diet.</p>
