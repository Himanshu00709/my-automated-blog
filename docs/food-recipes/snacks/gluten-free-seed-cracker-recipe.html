    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make these delicious gluten-free seed crackers.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent the crackers from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Seeds</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and sesame seeds. Stir well to ensure an even distribution of seeds.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Water and Seasoning</h3>
    <p>Add the water and salt to the seed mixture. If you're using any optional herbs or spices, add them at this stage. Mix thoroughly until all the seeds are well-coated and the mixture starts to thicken. Let it sit for about 10 minutes to allow the chia and flaxseeds to absorb the water and create a gel-like consistency.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Spread the Mixture</h3>
    <p>Transfer the seed mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Use a spatula or your hands to spread the mixture evenly into a thin layer, about 1/8 inch thick. The thinner the layer, the crispier the crackers will be.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Crackers</h3>
    <p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the edges start to turn golden brown. Keep an eye on the crackers to prevent burning, as oven temperatures can vary.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Break into Pieces</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the crackers from the oven and let them cool completely on the baking sheet. Once cooled, break the large sheet of crackers into smaller, bite-sized pieces.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Store and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Store your gluten-free seed crackers in an airtight container at room temperature. They should stay fresh for up to two weeks. Enjoy them as a snack, or pair them with your favorite dips and spreads.</p>
