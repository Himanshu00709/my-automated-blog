<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started on making these delicious gluten-free protein balls. Follow these simple steps, and you'll have a batch of protein-packed snacks in no time.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the rolled oats, protein powder, chia seeds, and a pinch of salt. Mix well to ensure that all the dry ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>

<p>Next, add the almond butter, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Stir until the mixture is well combined. If the mixture seems too dry, you can add a little more almond butter or honey to achieve the desired consistency.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Fold in Chocolate Chips</h3>

<p>If you're using dark chocolate chips, fold them into the mixture at this stage. The chocolate chips will add a delightful burst of flavor to each bite.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Form the Protein Balls</h3>

<p>Using your hands, scoop out small portions of the mixture and roll them into balls. The size of the balls is up to you, but aim for about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter. If the mixture is too sticky, you can lightly wet your hands to make the rolling process easier.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Chill and Serve</h3>

<p>Place the protein balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow them to firm up. Once chilled, your gluten-free protein balls are ready to enjoy! Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>
