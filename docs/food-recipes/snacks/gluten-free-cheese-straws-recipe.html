    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, grated sharp cheddar cheese, cold cubed butter, salt, paprika, and cayenne pepper (if using). Use your fingers or a pastry cutter to mix the ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add cold water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Shape the Cheese Straws</h3>
    <p>Once the dough is ready, roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking) to about 1/4-inch thickness. Using a sharp knife or a pizza cutter, cut the dough into thin strips, approximately 1/2-inch wide and 4-5 inches long. Carefully twist each strip to create the classic cheese straw shape.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the twisted cheese straws on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving some space between each straw to allow for even baking. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the cheese straws are golden brown and crisp. Keep an eye on them during the last few minutes to prevent over-browning.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the cheese straws from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve your gluten-free cheese straws as a snack or appetizer, and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Ingredients:</strong> Keeping the butter and water cold helps create a flaky texture in the cheese straws.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overwork the Dough:</strong> Overworking the dough can result in tough cheese straws. Mix just until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add other seasonings like garlic powder, onion powder, or even a pinch of chili flakes for a spicy kick.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store any leftover cheese straws in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. They can also be frozen for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different types of cheese, such as Parmesan, Gouda, or even a blend of cheeses. Just keep in mind that the flavor and texture may vary slightly depending on the cheese you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cheese straws ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days before baking. Alternatively, you can bake the cheese straws and store them in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</p>

        <h3>Are these cheese straws suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This particular recipe contains dairy (cheese and butter), so it is not vegan. However, you can try substituting the cheese with a vegan cheese alternative and using vegan butter to make a vegan version of these cheese straws.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the unbaked dough?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the unbaked dough for up to 1 month. Simply wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer-safe bag. When you're ready to bake, let the dough thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling and cutting.</p>
