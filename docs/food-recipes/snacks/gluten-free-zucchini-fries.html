    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Zucchini Fries</h2>
    <p>To ensure your zucchini fries turn out perfectly crispy and delicious, consider the following tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use fresh zucchini:</strong> Fresh zucchini will yield the best results, as older zucchini can become watery and less flavorful.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t skip the egg wash:</strong> The egg wash helps the breadcrumbs adhere to the zucchini, ensuring a crispy coating.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake, don’t fry:</strong> Baking the zucchini fries instead of frying them reduces the overall calorie count and makes them a healthier option.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with seasonings:</strong> Feel free to add your favorite herbs and spices to the breadcrumb mixture for added flavor.</li>
    </ul>
