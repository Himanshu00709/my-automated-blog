    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to make the perfect buttermilk gluten-free waffles:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your waffle iron:</strong> Start by preheating your waffle iron to medium-high heat. This ensures even cooking and a crispy exterior.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk the buttermilk, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense waffles.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the waffles:</strong> Lightly grease the waffle iron with non-stick spray or butter. Pour the batter onto the iron, using about 1/2 cup per waffle. Close the lid and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and enjoy:</strong> Serve the waffles warm with your favorite toppings, such as fresh fruit, maple syrup, or whipped cream.</li>
