<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Gluten-Free Bread</h3>
<p>Start by cubing the gluten-free bread into small pieces. Spread the cubes on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes, or until they are slightly crispy. This step ensures that the bread absorbs the chicken broth without becoming too soggy.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
<p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, celery, and garlic, and sauté until they are soft and fragrant, about 5-7 minutes. This mixture will form the flavor base of your dressing.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine the Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the toasted gluten-free bread cubes, sautéed vegetables, shredded chicken, and fresh herbs. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and chicken broth, then pour this mixture over the bread and chicken. Gently toss everything together until well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Bake the Dressing</h3>
<p>Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish and spread it out evenly. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and crispy.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Allow the dressing to cool for a few minutes before serving. Pair it with a fresh salad or steamed vegetables for a complete meal. This gluten-free chicken and dressing is perfect for family dinners, holiday gatherings, or meal prep.</p>
