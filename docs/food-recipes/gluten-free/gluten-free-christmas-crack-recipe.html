    <h2>What is Christmas Crack?</h2>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Arrange the Crackers</h3>
    <p>Arrange the gluten-free crackers in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Make sure they are close together but not overlapping.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Toffee</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the brown sugar and stir continuously until the mixture comes to a boil. Let it boil for 3 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burning. The mixture should thicken and become a rich caramel color.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Pour the Toffee Over the Crackers</h3>
    <p>Carefully pour the hot toffee mixture over the arranged crackers, spreading it evenly with a spatula to ensure all the crackers are covered.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 5 minutes. This will help the toffee set and adhere to the crackers.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Add the Chocolate</h3>
    <p>Remove the baking sheet from the oven and immediately sprinkle the chocolate chips over the hot toffee. Let the chocolate sit for a few minutes to melt, then spread it evenly with a spatula.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Add Toppings</h3>
    <p>While the chocolate is still soft, add your desired toppings. Crushed nuts, festive sprinkles, or a sprinkle of sea salt are all great options.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Break into Pieces</h3>
    <p>Allow the Christmas Crack to cool completely at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Once cooled, break it into pieces and serve.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use other types of gluten-free crackers?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free crackers you prefer. Just make sure they are sturdy enough to hold up under the toffee and chocolate layers.</p>

        <h3>How long does Gluten-Free Christmas Crack last?</h3>
        <p>When stored in an airtight container at room temperature, Gluten-Free Christmas Crack can last up to a week. For longer storage, you can keep it in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative and use dairy-free chocolate chips to make this recipe dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze Gluten-Free Christmas Crack?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze it for up to a month. Make sure to store it in an airtight container or freezer bag to prevent freezer burn.</p>
