    <h1>Gluten-Free Greek Recipes: A Culinary Journey</h1>
    <p>Greek cuisine is renowned for its rich flavors, fresh ingredients, and Mediterranean charm. For those following a gluten-free diet, Greek food offers a treasure trove of naturally gluten-free dishes that are both delicious and nutritious. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the best gluten-free Greek recipes, from hearty mains to delightful desserts, and provide tips for adapting traditional recipes to fit a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>Why Greek Cuisine is Perfect for Gluten-Free Diets</h2>
    <p>Greek cuisine is inherently rich in gluten-free options. Many traditional dishes rely on fresh vegetables, legumes, olive oil, and lean proteins, making them naturally free from gluten. Additionally, Greek cooking often uses rice, potatoes, and cornmeal instead of wheat-based products. This makes it easier for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity to enjoy authentic Greek flavors without worry.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Greek Recipes to Try at Home</h2>
    <p>Below are some classic Greek recipes that are either naturally gluten-free or can be easily adapted. These dishes are perfect for anyone looking to explore the flavors of Greece while maintaining a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h3>1. Greek Salad (Horiatiki)</h3>
    <p>This iconic dish is a staple of Greek cuisine and is naturally gluten-free. Made with fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, Kalamata olives, and feta cheese, it’s dressed simply with olive oil, oregano, and a splash of red wine vinegar. Serve it as a side dish or add grilled chicken for a complete meal.</p>

    <h3>2. Grilled Lamb Kebabs (Souvlaki)</h3>
    <p>Souvlaki is a popular Greek street food made with marinated pieces of lamb or pork grilled on skewers. The marinade typically includes olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and oregano, all of which are gluten-free. Serve with a side of gluten-free pita bread or a fresh Greek salad.</p>

    <h3>3. Spanakorizo (Spinach Rice)</h3>
    <p>This comforting dish combines spinach, rice, and herbs for a nutritious and gluten-free meal. It’s often flavored with dill, lemon juice, and olive oil, making it a light yet satisfying option. Spanakorizo can be served as a main dish or a side.</p>

    <h3>4. Gluten-Free Moussaka</h3>
    <p>Moussaka is a layered casserole traditionally made with eggplant, ground meat, and béchamel sauce. To make it gluten-free, substitute the flour in the béchamel with a gluten-free alternative like cornstarch or rice flour. The result is a rich and hearty dish that’s perfect for special occasions.</p>

    <h3>5. Loukoumades (Gluten-Free Greek Donuts)</h3>
    <p>These bite-sized donuts are a beloved Greek dessert. Traditionally made with wheat flour, they can be adapted to be gluten-free by using a gluten-free flour blend. Fried until golden and drizzled with honey and cinnamon, they’re a sweet treat that everyone can enjoy.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Cooking Gluten-Free Greek Food</h2>
    <p>When preparing gluten-free Greek recipes, keep the following tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Gluten-Free Flours:</strong> For recipes that call for flour, such as moussaka or loukoumades, opt for gluten-free alternatives like almond flour, rice flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose blend.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Labels:</strong> Some Greek ingredients, like certain brands of feta cheese or olives, may contain gluten. Always read labels carefully to ensure they’re gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Grains:</strong> Replace wheat-based grains with gluten-free options like quinoa, rice, or millet in salads and side dishes.</li>
