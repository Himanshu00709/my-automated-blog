<h1>Buffalo Wings Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Buffalo wings are a beloved dish that has become a staple at parties, sports bars, and family gatherings. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic dish can be a challenge. The good news is that with a few adjustments, you can still savor the spicy, tangy goodness of buffalo wings without the gluten. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about making and enjoying gluten-free buffalo wings, from the ingredients to the cooking process, and even some tips for dining out.</p>

<h2>What Makes Buffalo Wings Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Traditional buffalo wings are made from chicken wings that are deep-fried and then coated in a sauce made from hot sauce and butter. The primary concern for those avoiding gluten is the sauce and the frying process. Many commercial hot sauces and pre-made wing sauces contain gluten as a thickening agent or flavor enhancer. Additionally, if the wings are fried in the same oil as gluten-containing foods, cross-contamination can occur.</p>

<p>To ensure your buffalo wings are gluten-free, you’ll need to pay close attention to the ingredients in the sauce and the cooking method. Here’s a breakdown of what to look for:</p>

        <td>Check for Cross-Contamination</td>
        <td>Ensure the oil has not been used to fry gluten-containing foods.</td>
