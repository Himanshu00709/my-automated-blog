    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create a delicious gluten-free Chicken Francese:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong> Season the chicken cutlets with salt and pepper on both sides. In a shallow dish, whisk the eggs. In another dish, place the gluten-free flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the Chicken:</strong> Dip each chicken cutlet into the egg mixture, then coat it evenly with the gluten-free flour. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong> Heat olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken cutlets and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Sauce:</strong> In the same skillet, add the remaining butter, lemon juice, and chicken broth. Bring the mixture to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the sauce has slightly thickened.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine and Serve:</strong> Return the chicken to the skillet, spooning the sauce over the cutlets. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
