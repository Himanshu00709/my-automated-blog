    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter or a non-stick cooking spray to prevent the pudding from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Corn Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the corn kernels, gluten-free flour blend, sugar, baking powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to ensure all ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and melted butter. Gradually pour this mixture into the corn mixture, stirring until everything is well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Pudding</h3>
    <p>Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the center is set. You can test for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center; it should come out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the corn pudding to cool for 10-15 minutes before serving. It pairs wonderfully with roasted meats, grilled vegetables, or as a standalone dish. Garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or chives for an extra touch of flavor.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Corn Pudding</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Corn:</strong> If possible, use fresh corn kernels for the best flavor. However, frozen corn works just as well in a pinch.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Your Flour:</strong> Ensure that your gluten-free flour blend is certified gluten-free to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a sweeter pudding, you can increase the sugar to 1/2 cup. For a savory version, reduce the sugar to 2 tablespoons.</li>
        <li><strong>Dairy-Free Option:</strong> Substitute milk and butter with your favorite dairy-free alternatives, such as almond milk and coconut oil.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Corn Pudding</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use canned corn for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use canned corn, but make sure to drain and rinse it thoroughly before adding it to the mixture. Fresh or frozen corn is preferred for better texture and flavor.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I store leftover corn pudding?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the mixture a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. Bake it just before serving for the best results.</p>

        <h3>4. Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can be made vegan by using dairy-free milk, butter, and egg substitutes like flax eggs or commercial egg replacers.</p>
