    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pork</h3>
    <p>Start by trimming any excess fat from the pork shoulder. While some fat is necessary for flavor and moisture, too much can make the dish greasy. Pat the pork dry with paper towels and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Rub</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine the paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Rub this mixture evenly over the entire surface of the pork shoulder. This dry rub will infuse the meat with flavor as it cooks.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Slow Cooker</h3>
    <p>Place the seasoned pork shoulder in the slow cooker. In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free barbecue sauce, apple cider vinegar, chicken broth, and brown sugar. Pour this mixture over the pork, ensuring it’s well-coated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook Low and Slow</h3>
    <p>Set your slow cooker to low and cook the pork for 8-10 hours. If you’re short on time, you can cook it on high for 4-6 hours, but low and slow is the best method for achieving the most tender pulled pork.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Shred the Pork</h3>
    <p>Once the pork is cooked, remove it from the slow cooker and place it on a cutting board. Use two forks to shred the meat, discarding any large pieces of fat. Return the shredded pork to the slow cooker and mix it with the cooking liquid to keep it moist and flavorful.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free pulled pork is incredibly versatile. Here are some serving ideas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Serve it on gluten-free buns with coleslaw for a classic pulled pork sandwich.</li>
        <li>Pair it with gluten-free cornbread and a side of roasted vegetables.</li>
        <li>Use it as a topping for gluten-free nachos or baked potatoes.</li>
        <li>Add it to a gluten-free pizza for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different cut of pork?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use pork loin or pork tenderloin, but keep in mind that these cuts are leaner and may not be as tender as pork shoulder. Adjust the cooking time accordingly.</p>

        <h3>How do I know if my barbecue sauce is gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Always check the label for gluten-containing ingredients like wheat, barley, or rye. Many brands now offer gluten-free options, but it’s essential to verify.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe in an Instant Pot?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Use the pressure cook function for about 90 minutes, followed by a natural release. The results will be just as tender and flavorful.</p>

        <h3>How long can I store leftover pulled pork?</h3>
        <p>Leftover pulled pork can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>
