    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Chili Relleno Casserole</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create a delicious gluten-free Chili Relleno Casserole:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Roast the Poblano Peppers</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Place the poblano peppers on a baking sheet and roast them for about 20-25 minutes, turning occasionally, until the skins are blistered and charred. Remove them from the oven and let them cool. Once cooled, peel off the skins, remove the seeds, and slice the peppers into strips.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Egg Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, gluten-free flour, milk, salt, and black pepper until smooth. The gluten-free flour helps to thicken the batter, giving the casserole its signature texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with olive oil or cooking spray. Layer half of the roasted poblano peppers on the bottom of the dish, followed by half of the shredded cheese. Repeat the layers with the remaining peppers and cheese. Pour the egg batter evenly over the top, ensuring it covers the peppers and cheese.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Bake the casserole in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the center is set. Let it cool for 5-10 minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Chili Relleno Casserole</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free:</strong> Ideal for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, this dish avoids traditional flour, reducing the risk of digestive discomfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich in Protein:</strong> Eggs and cheese provide a good source of protein, which is essential for muscle repair and overall health.</li>

        <h3>Can I use other types of peppers?</h3>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free flour, you can use cornstarch or a gluten-free baking mix as a substitute. Both will help thicken the batter.</p>
