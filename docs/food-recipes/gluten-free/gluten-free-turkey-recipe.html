    <h2>Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Turkey</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 325째F (165째C). Remove the turkey from its packaging and pat it dry with paper towels. Make sure to remove the giblets and neck from the cavity if they are included. Place the turkey on a rack in a large roasting pan.</p>

    <h3>2. Creating the Gluten-Free Marinade</h3>

    <p>In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, minced garlic, chopped rosemary, thyme, sage, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to create a fragrant herb paste. Rub this mixture all over the turkey, making sure to coat it evenly, including under the skin for extra flavor.</p>

    <h3>3. Stuffing the Turkey</h3>

    <p>Stuff the cavity of the turkey with the quartered onion and lemon slices. These will infuse the turkey with additional flavor as it cooks. If you prefer not to stuff the turkey, you can place these ingredients around the turkey in the roasting pan.</p>

    <h3>4. Roasting the Turkey</h3>

    <p>Pour the gluten-free broth and soy sauce (or tamari) into the bottom of the roasting pan. This will keep the turkey moist and add depth to the flavor. Cover the turkey loosely with aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Roast for about 3 to 3.5 hours, or until the internal temperature of the turkey reaches 165째F (74째C) when measured with a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh.</p>

    <h3>5. Basting and Final Touches</h3>

    <p>Every 30 minutes, baste the turkey with the juices from the bottom of the pan. This will help keep the turkey moist and flavorful. During the last 30 minutes of cooking, remove the foil to allow the skin to brown and crisp up.</p>

    <h3>6. Resting and Serving</h3>

    <p>Once the turkey is fully cooked, remove it from the oven and let it rest for at least 20 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, ensuring a moist and tender result. Serve with your favorite gluten-free sides, such as roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh salad.</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use a frozen turkey, but make sure to thaw it completely in the refrigerator before cooking. This can take several days, depending on the size of the turkey.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I know if my broth and soy sauce are gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Always check the labels of your broth and soy sauce to ensure they are certified gluten-free. Many brands offer gluten-free versions of these products.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I prepare the turkey the night before?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the turkey the night before by seasoning it and storing it in the refrigerator. Just make sure to let it come to room temperature before roasting.</p>

        <h3>4. What are some gluten-free side dishes that pair well with turkey?</h3>
