    <h1>Gluten-Free French Fries Recipe: A Crispy Delight for Everyone</h1>
    <p>French fries are a beloved snack or side dish enjoyed by people of all ages. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding a safe and delicious option can be challenging. The good news is that making gluten-free French fries at home is not only easy but also allows you to control the ingredients and ensure they are free from cross-contamination. In this article, we’ll guide you through a step-by-step recipe for perfect gluten-free French fries, along with tips, FAQs, and more.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free French Fries?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. While potatoes themselves are naturally gluten-free, many commercially prepared French fries are coated with flour or fried in shared oil, making them unsafe for those with gluten sensitivities. By making your own gluten-free French fries, you can enjoy this classic treat without worrying about hidden gluten.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free French Fries</h2>
    <p>Here’s what you’ll need to make crispy, golden gluten-free French fries:</p>

    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Start by washing and peeling the potatoes. Cut them into even-sized sticks, about 1/4 inch thick. Soak the cut potatoes in cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch, which helps achieve a crispier texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Dry the Potatoes</h3>
    <p>After soaking, drain the potatoes and pat them dry thoroughly with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Removing excess moisture is crucial for achieving crispy fries.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Season the Potatoes</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, toss the dried potato sticks with olive oil, salt, pepper, and any optional seasonings like paprika or garlic powder. Ensure the potatoes are evenly coated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake or Fry</h3>
    <p>For a healthier option, preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Arrange the potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden and crispy. Alternatively, you can deep-fry the potatoes in gluten-free oil at 350°F (175°C) for 3-4 minutes or until golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once cooked, transfer the fries to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil. Sprinkle with additional salt if desired, and serve immediately with your favorite gluten-free dipping sauce.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free French Fries</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Potatoes:</strong> Russet potatoes are ideal for French fries due to their high starch content, which results in a fluffy interior and crispy exterior.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Oil:</strong> If frying, ensure the oil is fresh and hasn’t been used to cook gluten-containing foods to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcrowd the Pan:</strong> Whether baking or frying, give the fries enough space to cook evenly and crisp up.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free French Fries</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Are all French fries gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Not necessarily. While potatoes are naturally gluten-free, many restaurants and pre-packaged fries are coated with flour or fried in shared oil, making them unsafe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

        <h3>Can I use sweet potatoes for gluten-free fries?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Sweet potatoes make a delicious and nutritious alternative to regular potatoes. Follow the same steps for preparation and cooking.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best oil for frying gluten-free French fries?</h3>
        <p>Oils with a high smoke point, such as avocado oil, peanut oil, or canola oil, are ideal for frying. Ensure the oil is certified gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover gluten-free French fries?</h3>
        <p>Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat in the oven or air fryer to restore crispiness.</p>
