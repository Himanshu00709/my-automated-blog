    <h1>Madeleine Gluten-Free: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>Madeleines, those delightful shell-shaped cakes originating from France, have long been a favorite treat for many. Traditionally made with wheat flour, they are a staple in French patisseries and a beloved snack for tea time. However, with the rise of gluten intolerance and celiac disease, the demand for gluten-free alternatives has surged. Enter gluten-free madeleines—a delicious and healthy option that allows everyone to enjoy this classic treat without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Madeleines?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free madeleines are a variation of the traditional French madeleine, crafted without any gluten-containing ingredients. Instead of wheat flour, bakers use gluten-free flours such as almond flour, rice flour, or a blend of gluten-free flours to achieve a similar texture and taste. These madeleines are perfect for those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake.</p>

        <li>In another bowl, beat the eggs and then add the melted butter and vanilla extract. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Combine the wet and dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared madeleine pan, filling each mold about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are set.</li>
        <li>Allow the madeleines to cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Madeleines</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free madeleines turn out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a high-quality blend that is specifically designed for baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense madeleines. Mix until just combined for a light and airy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Batter:</strong> For best results, chill the batter for at least 30 minutes before baking. This helps the madeleines develop their characteristic hump.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Madeleine Pan:</strong> While you can use a muffin tin in a pinch, a madeleine pan is essential for achieving the traditional shell shape.</li>
    </ul>
