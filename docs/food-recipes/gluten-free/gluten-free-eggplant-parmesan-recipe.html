    <h1>Gluten-Free Eggplant Parmesan: A Delicious and Healthy Twist</h1>
    <p>Eggplant Parmesan is a classic Italian dish that combines the rich flavors of eggplant, marinara sauce, and melted cheese. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, traditional recipes can be off-limits due to the use of breadcrumbs.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Eggplant</h3>
    <p>Start by slicing the eggplants into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Sprinkle salt on both sides of the slices and let them sit for 30 minutes. This process helps to draw out excess moisture and bitterness. After 30 minutes, rinse the slices and pat them dry with a paper towel.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Coat the Eggplant</h3>
    <p>In a shallow bowl, whisk the eggs. In another bowl, combine the gluten-free breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan cheese. Dip each eggplant slice into the egg mixture, then coat it with the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to ensure it sticks.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Eggplant</h3>
    <p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the breaded eggplant slices in batches until they are golden brown on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer the cooked slices to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Dish</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of marinara sauce. Arrange a layer of cooked eggplant slices on top, followed by more marinara sauce and a sprinkle of mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers until all the eggplant slices are used, finishing with a layer of cheese on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake and Serve</h3>
    <p>Bake the eggplant Parmesan in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil if desired.</p>
