    <p>Scalloped potatoes are a timeless comfort food, perfect for family dinners, holiday gatherings, or even a cozy night in.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Start by washing and peeling the Yukon Gold potatoes. Thinly slice them using a sharp knife or a mandoline slicer for even thickness. This ensures that the potatoes cook evenly in the crock pot.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Gluten-Free Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant. Gradually whisk in the gluten-free flour to create a roux. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, to remove the raw flour taste. Slowly pour in the milk or heavy cream, whisking continuously to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook until it thickens, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese until melted and smooth. Season with salt, pepper, and paprika.</p>

    <h3>3. Layer the Potatoes and Sauce</h3>
    <p>In the crock pot, layer the sliced potatoes and pour the cheese sauce over each layer, ensuring that the potatoes are evenly coated. Repeat the layers until all the potatoes and sauce are used, finishing with a layer of sauce on top.</p>

    <h3>4. Cook in the Crock Pot</h3>
    <p>Cover the crock pot and cook on low for 6-7 hours or on high for 3-4 hours. The potatoes should be tender when pierced with a fork. About 30 minutes before the cooking time is up, sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese on top and let it melt.</p>

    <h3>5. Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the potatoes are cooked, garnish with fresh thyme or parsley if desired. Serve hot as a side dish or even as a main course for a comforting meal.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Scalloped Potatoes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Potatoes:</strong> Yukon Gold potatoes are ideal for scalloped potatoes because of their creamy texture and buttery flavor. Russet potatoes can also be used, but they tend to be starchier.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh garlic and high-quality cheese make a significant difference in flavor. Avoid pre-shredded cheese, as it often contains anti-caking agents that can affect the texture of the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook:</strong> Keep an eye on the cooking time to prevent the potatoes from becoming mushy. The goal is tender potatoes with a creamy, cheesy sauce.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like margarine or coconut oil, and use a dairy-free milk such as almond or oat milk. For the cheese, opt for a dairy-free shredded cheese.</p>

        <h3>Can I prepare this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can assemble the layers of potatoes and sauce in the crock pot the night before and refrigerate. When you’re ready to cook, simply place the crock pot in the base and start cooking.</p>

        <h3>What can I serve with gluten-free scalloped potatoes?</h3>
        <p>These potatoes pair well with roasted chicken, grilled steak, or a simple green salad. They’re also a great addition to holiday meals alongside ham or turkey.</p>
