    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free sourdough discard, gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add warm water and olive oil, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Pretzels:</strong> Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Roll each portion into a long rope and twist into a pretzel shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Boil the Pretzels:</strong> Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add 1/4 cup of baking soda. Boil each pretzel for 30 seconds, then remove with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Brush the pretzels with egg wash and sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake for 15-20 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the pretzels to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy warm with your favorite dipping sauce!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Sourdough Discard Pretzels</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free sourdough discard pretzels turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Good Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking bread.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Xanthan Gum:</strong> Xanthan gum helps to bind the dough and gives it the elasticity needed to shape the pretzels.</li>
        <li><strong>Boil Before Baking:</strong> Boiling the pretzels in a baking soda solution is what gives them their signature chewy texture and shiny crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> While coarse salt is traditional, feel free to get creative with toppings like sesame seeds, garlic powder, or even a sprinkle of cheese.</li>
    </ul>
