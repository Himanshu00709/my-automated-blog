    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by combining the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum (if needed), and salt in a large mixing bowl. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the granulated sugar and mix well. Gradually add cold water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Roll Out the Dough</h3>

    <p>Divide the dough into two equal portions. Roll out one portion on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) to about 1/8 inch thickness. Cut the dough into rectangles, approximately 3x4 inches in size. Repeat with the second portion of dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Filling</h3>

    <p>Place a small spoonful of your favorite jam or jelly in the center of half of the rectangles. Leave a small border around the edges to allow for sealing. Place the remaining rectangles on top of the filled ones and press the edges together with a fork to seal. Make sure the edges are well-sealed to prevent the filling from leaking out during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Pop Tarts</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the assembled pop tarts on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Prepare the Glaze</h3>

    <p>While the pop tarts are cooling, prepare the glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth. Adjust the consistency by adding more milk if needed. Once the pop tarts have cooled, drizzle the glaze over the top. Allow the glaze to set before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. Just make sure it contains xanthan gum or add it separately to help with the texture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these pop tarts ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the pop tarts and store them in an airtight container for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them before baking and bake them straight from the freezer when needed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What other fillings can I use?</h3>
        <p>You can get creative with the fillings! Try using chocolate hazelnut spread, fruit preserves, or even a savory filling like cheese and herbs.</p>
