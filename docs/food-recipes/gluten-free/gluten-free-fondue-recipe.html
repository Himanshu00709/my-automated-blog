<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Ingredients</h3>
<p>Start by shredding your gluten-free cheese. This ensures that it melts evenly and smoothly. Rub the inside of your fondue pot with the halved garlic clove to infuse it with flavor. If you don’t have a fondue pot, a heavy-bottomed saucepan will work just fine.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Create the Base</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch or gluten-free flour with a splash of the white wine to create a slurry. This will help thicken the fondue without clumping. Set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Heat the Wine</h3>
<p>Pour the remaining wine into the fondue pot and heat it over medium heat until it’s warm but not boiling. Add the lemon juice and a pinch of nutmeg for extra flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add the Cheese</h3>
<p>Gradually add the shredded cheese to the warm wine, stirring constantly in a figure-eight motion. This helps the cheese melt evenly and prevents it from clumping. Once the cheese is fully melted, stir in the cornstarch slurry and continue to cook until the fondue thickens to your desired consistency.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Transfer the fondue pot to a fondue burner to keep it warm. Serve with gluten-free bread, vegetables, or other dippers of your choice. Enjoy dipping and savoring the creamy, cheesy goodness!</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Fondue</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Choose the Right Cheese:</strong> Opt for naturally gluten-free cheeses like Gruyère, Emmental, or cheddar. Avoid pre-shredded cheeses, as they may contain gluten-based anti-caking agents.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Gluten-Free Thickeners:</strong> Cornstarch or gluten-free flour works well to thicken the fondue. Be sure to mix it with a liquid before adding it to the pot to prevent clumping.</li>
    <li><strong>Check Your Wine:</strong> Some wines may contain trace amounts of gluten due to the fining process. Look for wines labeled gluten-free to be safe.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Dippers:</strong> Gluten-free bread, steamed vegetables, apples, and even gluten-free pretzels make excellent dippers for your fondue.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fondue</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use any cheese for gluten-free fondue?</h3>
    <p>Most natural cheeses are gluten-free, but always check the label to ensure there are no added ingredients that contain gluten. Avoid processed cheeses, as they may contain gluten-based additives.</p>

    <h3>2. What can I use instead of bread for dipping?</h3>
    <p>There are plenty of gluten-free options for dipping, including steamed broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, apples, and gluten-free crackers or pretzels.</p>

    <h3>3. Is wine necessary for fondue?</h3>
    <p>Wine adds flavor and helps create a smooth texture, but you can substitute it with gluten-free broth or apple cider if you prefer a non-alcoholic version.</p>

    <h3>4. How do I store leftover fondue?</h3>
    <p>Leftover fondue can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat it gently on the stovetop, stirring frequently to maintain a smooth consistency.</p>
