    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the frozen hash browns, gluten-free cream of chicken soup, sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, melted butter, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Spread the mixture evenly into the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the crushed gluten-free cornflakes over the top of the potato mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the potatoes are heated through.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Party Potatoes</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free party potatoes turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check Labels:</strong> Always double-check the labels of your ingredients to ensure they are certified gluten-free. This is especially important for items like cream of chicken soup and cornflakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize Toppings:</strong> Feel free to get creative with your toppings. Crushed gluten-free crackers, breadcrumbs, or even a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese can add a delicious twist.</li>
