    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Gluten-Free Pasta</h3>
    <p>Start by cooking the gluten-free pasta according to the package instructions. Be sure to cook it al dente, as it will continue to cook in the oven later. Once cooked, drain the pasta and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, sautéing until softened and fragrant. Stir in the gluten-free flour to create a roux, cooking for 1-2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste. Gradually whisk in the chicken or turkey broth, followed by the heavy cream or coconut milk. Continue to whisk until the sauce thickens and becomes smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Turkey and Mushrooms</h3>
    <p>Once the sauce has thickened, add the cooked turkey and sliced mushrooms. Stir to combine, allowing the mixture to heat through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Pasta and Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked gluten-free pasta with the turkey and mushroom sauce. Toss everything together until the pasta is evenly coated. Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake and Serve</h3>
    <p>Sprinkle the grated Parmesan cheese over the top of the dish. Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly. Garnish with fresh parsley before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips and Variations</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free turkey tetrazzini recipe is highly adaptable. Here are some tips and variations to consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vegetable Additions:</strong> Feel free to add other vegetables like peas, spinach, or bell peppers for extra nutrition and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Dairy-Free Option:</strong> Substitute the heavy cream with coconut milk and use a dairy-free cheese alternative to make this recipe dairy-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Protein Swap:</strong> If you don’t have turkey, chicken or even tofu can be used as a substitute.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> This dish can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days before baking.</li>
    </ul>
