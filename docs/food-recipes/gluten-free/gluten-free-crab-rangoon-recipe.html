<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Filling</h3>

<p>Start by preparing the filling. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, crab meat, green onions, minced garlic, gluten-free soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix everything together until well combined. The filling should be creamy and evenly mixed.</p>

<h3>2. Assemble the Crab Rangoon</h3>

<p>Lay out your gluten-free wonton wrappers on a clean surface. Place about 1 teaspoon of the filling in the center of each wrapper. Moisten the edges of the wrapper with a little water, then fold the wrapper diagonally to form a triangle. Press the edges firmly to seal, ensuring there are no air pockets. You can also fold the corners together to create a traditional Rangoon shape.</p>

<h3>3. Fry the Crab Rangoon</h3>

<p>Heat the vegetable oil in a deep skillet or pot over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot (around 350°F), carefully add the Crab Rangoon in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry each piece for about 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy. Use a slotted spoon to remove the Crab Rangoon from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</p>

<h3>4. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Once all the Crab Rangoon are fried and drained, serve them warm with your favorite dipping sauce. Sweet and sour sauce, plum sauce, or even a simple gluten-free soy sauce are excellent choices. Enjoy your gluten-free Crab Rangoon as a delicious appetizer or snack!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I bake the Crab Rangoon instead of frying?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can bake the Crab Rangoon if you prefer a healthier option. Preheat your oven to 400°F and place the assembled Crab Rangoon on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Lightly brush the tops with oil and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.</p>

    <h3>Can I use imitation crab meat?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use imitation crab meat if you prefer. However, make sure to check the label to ensure it is gluten-free, as some imitation crab products may contain gluten.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftover Crab Rangoon?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover Crab Rangoon in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. To reheat, place them in a preheated oven at 350°F for about 10 minutes, or until heated through and crispy.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze the Crab Rangoon?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the assembled but uncooked Crab Rangoon. Place them on a baking sheet in a single layer and freeze until solid. Once frozen, transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container. When ready to cook, fry or bake them directly from frozen, adding a few extra minutes to the cooking time.</p>
