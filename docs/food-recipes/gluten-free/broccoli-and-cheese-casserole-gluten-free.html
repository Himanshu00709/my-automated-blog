    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your casserole bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown top.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Broccoli</h3>
    <p>If you’re using fresh broccoli, wash and cut it into bite-sized florets. Steam or blanch the broccoli until it’s tender but still crisp. If you’re using frozen broccoli, thaw it completely and drain any excess water.</p>

    <h3>3. Make the Cheese Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the gluten-free flour and whisk continuously to create a roux. Gradually pour in the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, then stir in 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese until melted and smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Casserole</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked broccoli and cheese sauce. Mix well to ensure the broccoli is evenly coated. Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish. If desired, sprinkle gluten-free breadcrumbs and the remaining cheese on top for a crispy, cheesy crust.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the casserole in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the top is bubbly and golden brown. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

Combined with the protein and calcium from cheese, this dish is a well-rounded addition to any meal. Here’s a breakdown of its nutritional highlights:</p>
