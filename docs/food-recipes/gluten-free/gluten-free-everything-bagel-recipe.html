    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Activate the Yeast</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, honey (or sugar), and active dry yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy. This indicates that the yeast is activated and ready to use.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of the ingredients. Add the activated yeast mixture, egg, and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Stir until a dough forms. The dough should be slightly sticky but manageable. If it’s too dry, add a tablespoon of water at a time until the desired consistency is reached.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Bagels</h3>
    <p>Divide the dough into 6 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball, then use your thumb to create a hole in the center, shaping it into a bagel. Place the shaped bagels on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover them with a clean kitchen towel and let them rise for about 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Boil the Bagels</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bring a large pot of water to a gentle boil. Carefully lower each bagel into the boiling water and let it cook for about 1-2 minutes on each side. This step helps create the chewy texture that bagels are known for. Remove the bagels from the water using a slotted spoon and place them back on the baking sheet.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Toppings</h3>
    <p>While the bagels are still wet from boiling, sprinkle the everything bagel seasoning generously over the top of each bagel. Press the seasoning lightly into the dough to ensure it sticks.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Bagels</h3>
    <p>Bake the bagels in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Remove from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Bagels</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t skip the xanthan gum:</strong> Xanthan gum is essential for binding the dough and giving it the chewy texture that bagels are known for.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the dough rise:</strong> Allowing the dough to rise before boiling and baking helps develop the flavor and texture of the bagels.</li>
        <li><strong>Boil before baking:</strong> Boiling the bagels before baking is a crucial step that gives them their signature chewy crust.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these bagels without yeast?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make gluten-free bagels without yeast by using baking powder as the leavening agent. However, the texture will be slightly different, and the bagels may not have the same chewy consistency as traditional bagels.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free bagels?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Gluten-free bagels freeze well. Once they are completely cooled, wrap them individually in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe bag. They can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply toast them straight from the freezer.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of everything bagel seasoning?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have everything bagel seasoning on hand, you can create your own blend using sesame seeds, poppy seeds, dried garlic, dried onion, and salt. Alternatively, you can top your bagels with other seasonings like cinnamon sugar or cheese.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free everything bagels at home is easier than you might think, and the results are well worth the effort. With the right ingredients and techniques, you can enjoy delicious, chewy bagels that are free from gluten but full of flavor. Whether you’re following a gluten-free diet or simply looking to try something new, this recipe is sure to become a favorite in your kitchen.
