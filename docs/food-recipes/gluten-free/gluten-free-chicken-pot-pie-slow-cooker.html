    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Slow Cooker</h3>
    <p>Start by greasing the inside of your slow cooker with a little butter or cooking spray. This will prevent the ingredients from sticking and make cleanup easier.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Chicken and Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Place the chicken breasts at the bottom of the slow cooker. Add the carrots, celery, peas, onion, and garlic on top of the chicken. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in the gluten-free flour until it forms a smooth paste. Gradually add the chicken broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until it thickens, about 5 minutes. Stir in the heavy cream and remove from heat.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine and Cook</h3>
    <p>Pour the sauce over the chicken and vegetables in the slow cooker. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high for 3-4 hours. The chicken should be tender and easily shredded with a fork.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Pie Crust</h3>
    <p>About 30 minutes before serving, roll out your gluten-free pie crust and place it over the top of the slow cooker. If your slow cooker has a removable insert, you can transfer the filling to an oven-safe dish and bake the crust in the oven at 375°F for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the crust is golden and the filling is bubbling, your gluten-free chicken pot pie is ready to serve. Spoon out generous portions and enjoy the comforting flavors of this classic dish, now made gluten-free!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen vegetables?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen vegetables in this recipe. Just make sure to thaw them before adding them to the slow cooker to ensure even cooking.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the heavy cream with a dairy-free alternative like coconut cream, and use a dairy-free butter substitute for the sauce.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave or oven before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this dish?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the filling without the crust for up to 3 months. When ready to eat, thaw in the refrigerator overnight and reheat in the slow cooker or oven. Add a fresh gluten-free crust before serving.</p>
