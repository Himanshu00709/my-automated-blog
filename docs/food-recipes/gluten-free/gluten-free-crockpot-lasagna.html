    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the steps to make this delicious gluten-free crockpot lasagna.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Meat Sauce</h3>
    <p>Start by heating the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, sautéing until they become fragrant and translucent. Next, add the ground beef or turkey to the skillet, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Once the meat is fully cooked, drain any excess fat and stir in the marinara sauce. Let the mixture simmer for about 5 minutes to allow the flavors to combine.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Cheese Filling</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and egg. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated. If you’re adding spinach, now is the time to fold it into the cheese mixture. This will add a nutritious boost to your lasagna.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Lasagna in the Crockpot</h3>
    <p>Begin by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of your crockpot. This will prevent the noodles from sticking. Next, place a layer of gluten-free lasagna noodles over the sauce, breaking them if necessary to fit the shape of your crockpot. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by another layer of meat sauce. Repeat this process until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese over the final layer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Cover the crockpot with its lid and set it to cook on low for 4-6 hours or on high for 2-3 hours. The lasagna is done when the noodles are tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Avoid opening the lid too often during cooking, as this can slow down the process.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the lasagna is cooked, turn off the crockpot and let it sit for about 10 minutes before serving. This allows the lasagna to set and makes it easier to slice. Serve with a side salad or garlic bread for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Crockpot Lasagna</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use no-boil gluten-free lasagna noodles?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use no-boil gluten-free lasagna noodles for this recipe. They will soften as they cook in the crockpot, absorbing the moisture from the sauce and cheese.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegetarian?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply omit the ground meat and replace it with additional vegetables like zucchini, mushrooms, or bell peppers. You can also use a plant-based meat substitute if desired.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftover lasagna can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply microwave individual portions or warm them in the oven at 350°F until heated through.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free crockpot lasagna?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this lasagna freezes well. Allow it to cool completely, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before placing it in the freezer. It can be stored for up to 3 months. To reheat, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and bake at 350°F until heated through.</p>
