    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free pumpkin bars:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the wet ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, mix the pumpkin puree, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and vegetable oil. Stir until the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense bars.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the bars:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the pumpkin bars to cool completely in the pan before cutting them into squares. Serve as is or with a dollop of whipped cream for an extra treat.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pumpkin Bars</h2>
    <p>To ensure your pumpkin bars turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough bars. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking your bars at the 25-minute mark. The toothpick test is a reliable way to ensure they're done.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> These bars can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture may vary. Almond flour adds moisture and richness, but you can try coconut flour or oat flour if you prefer.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these bars dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This recipe is naturally dairy-free, so no substitutions are needed. Just ensure that any additional toppings or frostings you use are also dairy-free.</p>
