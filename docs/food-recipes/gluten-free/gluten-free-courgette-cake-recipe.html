    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the vegetable oil and vanilla extract, and mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Courgette:</strong> Fold in the grated courgette and chopped walnuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Courgette Cake</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free courgette cake turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Courgettes:</strong> Fresh courgettes will provide the best moisture and flavor. Make sure to grate them finely and squeeze out any excess moisture before adding them to the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense cake. Mix until just combined to keep the cake light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking the cake at the 35-minute mark. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Add a Frosting:</strong> For an extra touch of sweetness, consider adding a cream cheese frosting or a simple glaze to your cake.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular flour if you don't need the cake to be gluten-free. However, the texture and moisture level may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the courgette cake?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This cake freezes well. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and store it in an airtight container. It can be frozen for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute the sugar with a healthier alternative?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use coconut sugar, maple syrup, or honey as a substitute for granulated sugar. Keep in mind that this may alter the texture and sweetness of the cake.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of walnuts?</h3>
        <p>If you're not a fan of walnuts, you can use pecans, almonds, or simply omit the nuts altogether.</p>
