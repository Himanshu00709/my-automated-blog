    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Beef</h3>
    <p>Slice the beef thinly against the grain. This ensures that the beef remains tender when cooked. In a bowl, combine the beef with 1 tablespoon of gluten-free soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. Mix well and let it marinate for at least 15 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining gluten-free soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes (if using). Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Broccoli</h3>
    <p>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the broccoli florets and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until they are bright green and slightly tender. Remove the broccoli from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Beef</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the remaining olive oil. Add the minced garlic and ginger, and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the marinated beef and cook for 2-3 minutes until browned but not fully cooked through.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine and Simmer</h3>
    <p>Return the broccoli to the skillet with the beef. Pour the prepared sauce over the beef and broccoli, and stir to combine. Let it simmer for 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens and the beef is fully cooked.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve</h3>
    <p>Garnish with chopped green onions and serve hot over steamed rice or cauliflower rice for a low-carb option.</p>
