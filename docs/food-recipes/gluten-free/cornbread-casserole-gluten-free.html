    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free cornbread casserole:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and grease a 9x9 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free cornmeal, gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, melted butter, and honey (or sugar). Stir in the creamed corn and sour cream until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense casserole.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Allow the casserole to cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy it warm as a side dish or as a main course with your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Customization Tips</h2>
    <p>One of the best things about cornbread casserole is its versatility. Here are some ideas for customizing your gluten-free version:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Add shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese to the batter for a cheesy twist.</li>
        <li><strong>Jalapeños:</strong> For a spicy kick, mix in diced jalapeños or top the casserole with sliced jalapeños before baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Bacon:</strong> Crumbled bacon can be added to the batter or sprinkled on top for a smoky flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Herbs:</strong> Fresh herbs like chives or parsley can add a burst of freshness to the casserole.</li>
    </ul>
