    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions for making gluten-free slow cooker lasagna.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Meat Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or turkey over medium heat until it’s fully browned. Drain any excess fat, then add the marinara sauce, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine and let the sauce simmer for about 5 minutes. This will allow the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Cheese Filling</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and half of the grated Parmesan cheese. Mix until well combined. This mixture will add a creamy, cheesy layer to your lasagna.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Lasagna in the Slow Cooker</h3>
    <p>Start by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of your slow cooker. This will prevent the noodles from sticking. Next, place a layer of gluten-free lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. You may need to break the noodles to fit the shape of your slow cooker. Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat these layers until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Cover the slow cooker and cook on low for 4-6 hours or on high for 2-3 hours. The lasagna is done when the noodles are tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Avoid opening the slow cooker too often, as this can slow down the cooking process.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the lasagna is cooked, let it sit for about 10 minutes before serving. This will help it set and make it easier to slice. Serve with a side salad or garlic bread for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Slow Cooker Lasagna</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Noodles:</strong> Not all gluten-free lasagna noodles are created equal. Look for brands that hold up well during cooking and don’t become mushy.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook:</strong> Gluten-free noodles can become too soft if overcooked. Keep an eye on the lasagna during the last hour of cooking to ensure the noodles are just tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Vegetables:</strong> For a healthier twist, consider adding layers of spinach, zucchini, or mushrooms to your lasagna.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh herbs and high-quality cheeses can elevate the flavor of your lasagna.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>Can I make this lasagna ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can assemble the lasagna in the slow cooker insert the night before and refrigerate it. When you’re ready to cook, simply place the insert back into the slow cooker and follow the cooking instructions.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free slow cooker lasagna?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Once the lasagna has cooled, you can slice it into portions and freeze them in airtight containers. To reheat, simply thaw in the refrigerator overnight and warm in the oven or microwave.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of ricotta cheese?</h3>
        <p>If you’re not a fan of ricotta, you can substitute it with cottage cheese or a dairy-free alternative like tofu ricotta.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use ground chicken, pork, or even a plant-based meat substitute if you prefer.</p>
