    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free blueberry muffins:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, eggs, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in blueberries:</strong> Gently fold the fresh blueberries into the batter. If you're using frozen blueberries, toss them in a little gluten-free flour before adding them to prevent them from sinking to the bottom.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill muffin cups:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full. This allows room for the muffins to rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Blueberry Muffins</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be able to achieve perfect muffins every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough muffins. Stir until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use fresh blueberries:</strong> Fresh blueberries provide the best flavor and texture. If using frozen, do not thaw them before adding to the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking your muffins at the 20-minute mark. The tops should be golden brown, and a toothpick should come out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Store muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or freeze for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>
