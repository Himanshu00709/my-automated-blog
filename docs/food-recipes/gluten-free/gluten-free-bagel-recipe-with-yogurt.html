<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat Your Oven</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your bagels will bake evenly and achieve the perfect texture.</p>

<h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure they are evenly distributed. This step is crucial for achieving a consistent texture in your bagels.</p>

<h3>3. Add the Yogurt</h3>

<p>Next, add the Greek yogurt to the dry ingredients. Use a spatula or your hands to mix everything together until a dough forms. The dough should be slightly sticky but manageable. If it's too dry, you can add a tablespoon of water or more yogurt.</p>

<h3>4. Shape the Bagels</h3>

<p>Divide the dough into 6 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball, then use your thumb to create a hole in the center, shaping it into a bagel. Place the shaped bagels on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

<h3>5. Apply the Egg Wash</h3>

<p>In a small bowl, beat the egg and brush it over the top of each bagel. This will give them a beautiful golden color when baked. If desired, sprinkle sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or everything bagel seasoning on top for added flavor and texture.</p>

<h3>6. Bake the Bagels</h3>

<p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the bagels are golden brown and firm to the touch. Allow them to cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Bagels with Yogurt</h2>

<p>These gluten-free bagels are not only delicious but also offer several nutritional benefits. Greek yogurt is a great source of protein and probiotics, which support gut health. The gluten-free flour blend provides a good amount of fiber, especially if it includes whole grains like brown rice or quinoa. Additionally, this recipe is lower in calories and fat compared to traditional bagels, making it a healthier choice for breakfast or snacks.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use regular yogurt instead of Greek yogurt?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use regular yogurt, but Greek yogurt is preferred because it has a thicker consistency, which helps create a better dough texture. If using regular yogurt, you may need to adjust the amount of flour slightly to achieve the right consistency.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these bagels vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! To make this recipe vegan, substitute the Greek yogurt with a plant-based yogurt (such as almond or coconut yogurt) and use a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of the egg wash.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these bagels?</h3>
    <p>Store the bagels in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 3 months. Simply thaw and reheat in the oven or toaster when ready to eat.</p>

    <h3>Can I add other flavors to the dough?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can customize the flavor of your bagels by adding ingredients like cinnamon, raisins, or even cheese to the dough. Be creative and experiment with different combinations to suit your taste.</p>

<p>This gluten-free bagel recipe with yogurt is a game-changer for anyone looking to enjoy a classic breakfast treat without the gluten. With simple ingredients and easy-to-follow steps, you can whip up a batch of these delicious bagels in no time.
