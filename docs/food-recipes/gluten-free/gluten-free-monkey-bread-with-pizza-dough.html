    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Quantity</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Gluten-free pizza dough</td>
                <td>1 lb (store-bought or homemade)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Unsalted butter</td>
                <td>1/2 cup (melted)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Granulated sugar</td>
                <td>1/2 cup</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Brown sugar</td>
                <td>1/2 cup</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Ground cinnamon</td>
                <td>1 tablespoon</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vanilla extract</td>
                <td>1 teaspoon</td>

        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). If you're using store-bought gluten-free pizza dough, let it come to room temperature for easier handling. If you're making your own dough, ensure it's well-kneaded and ready to use.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Create the Coating</h3>

    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the granulated sugar and ground cinnamon. In a separate bowl, combine the melted butter and vanilla extract. These mixtures will be used to coat the dough pieces, giving the monkey bread its signature sweet and sticky texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Dough</h3>

    <p>Roll the dough into small, bite-sized balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Dip each ball into the melted butter mixture, ensuring it's fully coated, then roll it in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Place the coated balls into a greased bundt pan, layering them evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Optional Ingredients</h3>

    <p>If you're adding nuts or raisins, sprinkle them between the layers of dough balls. This adds an extra layer of flavor and texture to your monkey bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>

    <p>Place the bundt pan in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the monkey bread is golden brown and the dough is fully cooked. Remove from the oven and let it cool for about 10 minutes before inverting it onto a serving plate.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free monkey bread turns out perfectly:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Non-Stick Pan:</strong> To prevent sticking, make sure your bundt pan is well-greased or use a non-stick pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overbake:</strong> Gluten-free dough can dry out quickly, so keep an eye on the baking time to avoid overbaking.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add other spices like nutmeg or cardamom for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this recipe vegan by using a vegan gluten-free pizza dough and substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative like coconut oil or vegan margarine.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of dough?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While this recipe calls for gluten-free pizza dough, you can use any gluten-free dough you prefer, such as biscuit dough or bread dough.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover monkey bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, refrigerate for up to a week or freeze for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough balls and coat them in the butter and sugar mixture ahead of time. Store them in the refrigerator overnight and bake them the next day.</p>
