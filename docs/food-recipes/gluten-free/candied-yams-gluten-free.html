    <h1>Candied Yams Gluten-Free: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>Candied yams are a classic dish that often graces holiday tables, but did you know they can also be made gluten-free? This delightful side dish is not only a crowd-pleaser but can also be adapted to fit a gluten-free diet without sacrificing flavor or texture. In this article, we'll explore the history of candied yams, how to make them gluten-free, and why they are a nutritious addition to your meal.</p>

    <h2>The History of Candied Yams</h2>

    <p>Candied yams have a rich history that dates back to the early days of American cuisine. The dish is believed to have originated in the Southern United States, where yams and sweet potatoes were staple crops. The term "candied" refers to the process of cooking the yams in a sweet syrup, often made with sugar, butter, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. Over time, the dish became a holiday favorite, particularly during Thanksgiving and Christmas.</p>

    <p>Interestingly, what many people in the United States call "yams" are actually sweet potatoes. True yams are a different species, native to Africa and Asia, and are not commonly found in American grocery stores. However, the term "candied yams" has stuck, and the dish remains a beloved tradition.</p>

As a result, many people are choosing to adopt a gluten-free diet, either out of necessity or as a lifestyle choice.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, candied yams can easily be made gluten-free with a few simple substitutions. By using gluten-free ingredients and being mindful of cross-contamination, you can enjoy this classic dish without worrying about gluten.</p>
