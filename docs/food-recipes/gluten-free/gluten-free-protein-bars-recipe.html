By making your own gluten-free protein bars, you can ensure that you're consuming wholesome ingredients without any hidden additives.</p>

        <li><strong>Combine:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix thoroughly. If the mixture is too dry, add a tablespoon of water or almond milk to achieve a sticky consistency.</li>
