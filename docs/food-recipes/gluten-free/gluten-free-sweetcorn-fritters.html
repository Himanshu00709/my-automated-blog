    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, salt, and black pepper. Whisk in the eggs and milk until you have a smooth batter. Add the sweetcorn kernels and chopped herbs, and mix well to ensure everything is evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Heat the Oil</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Make sure the oil is hot but not smoking before you start frying the fritters.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Fritters</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or ladle, drop small portions of the batter into the hot oil. Flatten them slightly with the back of the spoon to form fritters. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Remove the fritters from the pan and place them on a paper towel to drain any excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve the fritters warm with your favorite dipping sauce, such as sour cream, guacamole, or a spicy aioli. They can also be paired with a fresh salad for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Sweetcorn Fritters</h2>

    <p>Sweetcorn fritters are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. Sweetcorn is a good source of dietary fiber, which aids digestion and promotes gut health. It also contains essential vitamins like vitamin B6, folate, and vitamin C, as well as antioxidants that help protect your cells from damage. When made with gluten-free flour, these fritters are suitable for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Sweetcorn Fritters</h2>

        <h3>1. Can I use frozen sweetcorn for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, frozen sweetcorn works perfectly fine. Just make sure to thaw and drain it before adding it to the batter.</p>

        <h3>2. What can I use instead of eggs to make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>You can substitute eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) or a commercial egg replacer.</p>

        <h3>3. How do I store leftover fritters?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover fritters in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat them in a toaster oven or frying pan to maintain their crispiness.</p>
