<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Madeleine Pan</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease your madeleine pan with butter or a non-stick cooking spray, then dust it lightly with gluten-free flour. This will ensure that the madeleines release easily after baking.</p>

<h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, tapioca starch, baking powder, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

<h3>3. Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract and lemon zest (if using).</p>

<h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense madeleines. The batter should be smooth and slightly thick.</p>

<h3>5. Fill the Madeleine Pan</h3>

<p>Spoon the batter into the prepared madeleine pan, filling each mold about 3/4 full. You can also use a piping bag for more precision. Tap the pan gently on the counter to remove any air bubbles.</p>

<h3>6. Bake the Madeleines</h3>

<p>Bake the madeleines in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers spring back when lightly touched. Be careful not to overbake, as this can dry out the madeleines.</p>

<h3>7. Cool and Serve</h3>

<p>Allow the madeleines to cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with powdered sugar if desired, and serve with your favorite tea or coffee.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Madeleines</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of flours and starches for the best texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense madeleines. Mix until just combined for a light and airy texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill the batter:</strong> If you have time, chilling the batter for 30 minutes before baking can help the madeleines develop their characteristic hump.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> While lemon zest is a classic addition, you can also try orange zest, almond extract, or even a sprinkle of cinnamon for a unique twist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Madeleines</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture may vary. A blend of flours and starches usually works best for achieving the light, airy texture of traditional madeleines.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these madeleines dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. Just make sure to use a product that has a similar fat content to butter for the best results.</p>

    <h3>How should I store gluten-free madeleines?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free madeleines are best enjoyed fresh, but they can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to a month.</p>

    <h3>Why didn’t my madeleines develop a hump?</h3>
    <p>The hump is a signature feature of madeleines and is often achieved by chilling the batter before baking. If your madeleines didn’t develop a hump, try chilling the batter for 30 minutes before baking next time.</p>
</div>
