    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Squash</h3>
    <p>Start by washing and slicing the yellow squash and zucchini into thin rounds. Chop the onion into small pieces. In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add the squash, zucchini, and onion, and sauté until they are tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a separate saucepan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Stir in the gluten-free flour to create a roux. Gradually whisk in the milk, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and stir in half of the shredded cheddar cheese until melted.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the sautéed squash mixture with the cheese sauce. Beat the eggs in a small bowl and then stir them into the squash mixture. Transfer the mixture to a greased casserole dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Toppings</h3>
    <p>Sprinkle the remaining shredded cheddar cheese over the top of the casserole. Then, evenly distribute the gluten-free breadcrumbs over the cheese. This will create a delicious, crispy topping when baked.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the casserole for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the casserole is bubbly. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>
