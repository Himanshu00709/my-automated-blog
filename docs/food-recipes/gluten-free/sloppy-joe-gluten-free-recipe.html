    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by gathering all your ingredients and chopping the onion, garlic, and green bell pepper. Having everything prepped and ready will make the cooking process smoother and more enjoyable.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Ground Beef</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it’s browned and no longer pink. Make sure to break up the meat into small crumbles as it cooks. Once the beef is cooked, drain any excess fat from the skillet.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the chopped onion, garlic, and green bell pepper. Sauté the vegetables until they are soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes. This step adds depth of flavor to your Sloppy Joe mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Sauce Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Next, add the tomato sauce, tomato paste, gluten-free Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, and mustard to the skillet. Stir everything together until well combined. Allow the mixture to simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will help the flavors meld together and thicken the sauce.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Season to Taste</h3>
    <p>Season the Sloppy Joe mixture with salt and pepper to taste. If you prefer a bit of heat, you can also add a pinch of red pepper flakes or a dash of hot sauce at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Toast your gluten-free buns lightly if desired, then spoon the Sloppy Joe mixture onto the buns. Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious, gluten-free Sloppy Joes!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegetarian?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the ground beef with a plant-based ground meat alternative, such as crumbled tofu, tempeh, or a store-bought meat substitute. Just make sure to adjust the cooking time as needed.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free Worcestershire sauce?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free Worcestershire sauce on hand, you can use a combination of soy sauce (gluten-free) and a splash of vinegar to mimic the tangy flavor. Alternatively, you can omit it altogether and adjust the seasoning to your taste.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the Sloppy Joe mixture?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this Sloppy Joe mixture freezes well. Allow it to cool completely, then transfer it to an airtight container or freezer bag. It can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. When ready to eat, simply thaw and reheat on the stove or in the microwave.</p>
