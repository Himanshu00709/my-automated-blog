<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a loaf pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of almond flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon of cloves. Whisk these dry ingredients together until well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together 3 large eggs, 1 cup of pumpkin puree, 1/4 cup of melted coconut oil, and 1/2 cup of stevia or monk fruit sweetener. Ensure that the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense loaf.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve as is, or with a dollop of whipped cream or a drizzle of sugar-free glaze.</p>

<p>This gluten-free pumpkin bread is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Almond flour is rich in healthy fats, protein, and fiber, making it a great alternative to traditional flour.

<h2>FAQs</h2>

    <h3>Can I use a different flour instead of almond flour?</h3>

    <h3>Can I add nuts or chocolate chips to the bread?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Feel free to add chopped nuts, sugar-free chocolate chips, or even dried fruit to the batter for added texture and flavor.</p>

    <h3>How should I store the pumpkin bread?</h3>
    <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze it for longer storage.</p>
