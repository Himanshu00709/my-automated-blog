<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Beef</h3>
<p>Start by thinly slicing the beef into strips. Season the beef with salt and pepper, then lightly coat it with gluten-free flour. This will help thicken the sauce later on. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil or butter. Sear the beef in batches until it’s browned on all sides. Remove the beef from the skillet and set it aside.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Cook the Vegetables</h3>
<p>In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of olive oil or butter. Add the chopped onion and cook until it’s soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and sliced mushrooms, and cook until the mushrooms are tender and have released their moisture, about 8-10 minutes.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Make the Sauce</h3>
<p>Return the beef to the skillet with the vegetables. Sprinkle the remaining gluten-free flour over the mixture and stir to combine. Gradually pour in the beef broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add the Sour Cream</h3>
<p>Reduce the heat to low and stir in the sour cream. If you’re using Dijon mustard, add it at this stage as well. Stir until everything is well combined and heated through. Be careful not to let the sauce boil, as this can cause the sour cream to curdle.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Serve the stroganoff over gluten-free pasta or rice. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired, and enjoy your delicious, gluten-free meal!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use chicken, turkey, or even a plant-based meat substitute if you prefer. Just adjust the cooking time accordingly.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of sour cream?</h3>
    <p>If you’re dairy-free, you can use a dairy-free sour cream alternative or coconut cream. The flavor will be slightly different, but it will still be delicious.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the stroganoff ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat it gently on the stove, adding a little extra broth if needed to thin the sauce.</p>

    <h3>Is this recipe suitable for freezing?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the stroganoff for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and reheat it on the stove. Note that the sour cream may separate slightly upon reheating, but it will still taste great.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free stroganoff is a wonderful way to enjoy a classic dish without compromising on flavor or texture.
