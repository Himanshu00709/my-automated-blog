    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> In a large bowl, mix the yogurt, half of the minced garlic, half of the grated ginger, and half of the spices. Add the chicken pieces and ensure they are well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken and cook until browned on all sides. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong> In the same skillet, add the remaining olive oil. Add the remaining garlic and ginger, and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Add the tomato puree and the remaining spices, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine and Simmer:</strong> Return the chicken to the skillet and stir to coat it with the sauce. Add the heavy cream and stir well. Reduce the heat to low and let the dish simmer for 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Garnish with fresh cilantro if desired, and serve with gluten-free naan or rice.</li>
