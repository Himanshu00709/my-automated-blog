    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Salisbury Steak?</h2>
    <p>Salisbury steak is a dish that typically consists of ground beef patties mixed with breadcrumbs and seasonings, served with a rich gravy.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Steak Patties</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, gluten-free breadcrumbs, chopped onion, minced garlic, egg, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper. Mix until all ingredients are well incorporated. Shape the mixture into 4 oval-shaped patties, about 1/2 inch thick.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Patties</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the patties and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are browned and cooked through. Remove the patties from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Gravy</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the gluten-free flour blend and whisk it into the remaining oil and juices. Cook for about 1 minute to remove the raw flour taste. Gradually add the beef broth, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Stir in the ketchup and Dijon mustard. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the gravy thickens, about 5 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine and Serve</h3>
    <p>Return the cooked patties to the skillet, spooning the gravy over them. Reduce the heat to low and let the patties simmer in the gravy for an additional 5 minutes. Garnish with chopped parsley before serving.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free Salisbury steak pairs wonderfully with mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, or a fresh green salad. For a complete gluten-free meal, consider serving it with gluten-free dinner rolls or rice.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute ground beef with ground turkey, chicken, or even a plant-based ground meat alternative. Just be sure to adjust the cooking time as needed.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free breadcrumbs, you can use crushed gluten-free crackers or even almond flour as a substitute.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the patties and gravy ahead of time and store them separately in the refrigerator. When ready to serve, simply reheat the patties in the gravy on the stovetop.</p>

        <h3>Is Worcestershire sauce gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Not all Worcestershire sauces are gluten-free, so be sure to check the label. There are several brands that offer gluten-free versions, such as Lea & Perrins.</p>
    </div>
