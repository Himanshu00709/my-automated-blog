    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free Salisbury steak:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Patties:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, gluten-free breadcrumbs, chopped onion, minced garlic, egg, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper. Mix until well combined. Shape the mixture into 4 oval-shaped patties.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Patties:</strong> Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the patties and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are browned and cooked through. Remove the patties from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Gravy:</strong> In the same skillet, add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they are softened, about 3-4 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and water until smooth. Pour the beef broth into the skillet with the mushrooms, then add the cornstarch mixture. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Cook until the gravy thickens, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine and Serve:</strong> Return the patties to the skillet, spooning the gravy over them. Let them simmer in the gravy for an additional 2-3 minutes to absorb the flavors. Serve hot, ideally with mashed potatoes or steamed vegetables.</li>
