<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Fig Filling</h3>
<p>Start by making the fig filling, as it needs time to cool. In a small saucepan, combine the dried figs, water, and lemon juice. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the figs are soft and the liquid has reduced. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly. Once cooled, transfer the mixture to a food processor and blend until smooth. Set aside.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Dough</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, cream the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. The dough should be soft but not sticky. If it’s too dry, add a tablespoon of water at a time until it reaches the desired consistency.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble the Fig Newtons</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide the dough into two equal portions. Roll out one portion of the dough into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread half of the fig filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Carefully roll the dough into a log, enclosing the filling. Repeat with the second portion of dough and filling. Place the logs on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.</p>

<h3>4. Cool and Slice</h3>
<p>Once baked, remove the logs from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack. Once cooled, slice the logs into individual Fig Newtons. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container for up to a week.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use fresh figs instead of dried figs?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use fresh figs, but you’ll need to adjust the recipe slightly. Fresh figs have a higher water content, so you may need to cook them longer to achieve the right consistency for the filling.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of almond flour?</h3>
    <p>If you have a nut allergy, you can substitute almond flour with oat flour or another gluten-free flour of your choice. Keep in mind that this may slightly alter the texture of the dough.</p>

    <h3>How do I store gluten-free Fig Newtons?</h3>
    <p>Store the Fig Newtons in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to three months. Simply thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make this recipe vegan by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) instead of a regular egg.</p>
