    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Sausage Balls?</h2>

Traditional sausage balls often contain flour, which is a no-go for those avoiding gluten.

    <h2>Ingredients You'll Need</h2>

    <p>One of the best things about this recipe is its simplicity. You only need three ingredients to make these delicious sausage balls:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Quantity</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Gluten-Free Baking Mix</td>
                <td>2 cups</td>
                <td>Ensure it's a 1:1 substitute for regular flour.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Ground Sausage</td>
                <td>1 pound</td>
                <td>Choose your favorite variety—mild, spicy, or even turkey sausage.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Shredded Cheddar Cheese</td>
                <td>2 cups</td>
                <td>Sharp cheddar works best for a robust flavor.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making these sausage balls is as easy as 1-2-3. Here's how to do it:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your sausage balls will cook evenly and develop a nice golden-brown crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free baking mix, ground sausage, and shredded cheddar cheese. Use your hands or a sturdy spoon to mix everything together until well combined. The mixture should be slightly sticky but hold together when formed into balls.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Form the Balls</h3>
    <p>Using a tablespoon or a small cookie scoop, portion out the mixture and roll it into 1-inch balls. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing them about an inch apart to allow for even cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the sausage balls in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. You can check for doneness by cutting one open to ensure there's no pink in the center.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once baked, let the sausage balls cool for a few minutes before serving. They are best enjoyed warm, but they also make a great cold snack if you have leftovers.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Sausage Balls</h2>

    <p>Here are a few tips to ensure your sausage balls turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh sausage and cheese will yield the best flavor and texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can make the sausage balls tough. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add herbs, spices, or even a bit of garlic powder to customize the flavor to your liking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these sausage balls ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the sausage balls ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before baking. You can also freeze the unbaked balls and bake them directly from the freezer, adding a few extra minutes to the cooking time.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While cheddar cheese is the classic choice, you can experiment with other types of cheese like mozzarella, pepper jack, or even a blend of cheeses for a different flavor profile.</p>

        <h3>Are these sausage balls keto-friendly?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can be made keto-friendly by using a low-carb gluten-free baking mix and ensuring that the sausage and cheese you use are also low in carbs. Always check the labels to make sure they fit within your dietary requirements.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the ground sausage with ground turkey, chicken, or even plant-based sausage if you prefer. Just keep in mind that the flavor and texture may vary slightly.</p>
