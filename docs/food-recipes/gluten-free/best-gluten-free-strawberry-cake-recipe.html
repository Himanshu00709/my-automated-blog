    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create the perfect gluten-free strawberry cake:</p>
    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined; do not overmix.</p>

    <h3>6. Fold in Strawberries</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the chopped strawberries using a spatula. Be careful not to crush the strawberries too much.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>8. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can frost the cake with your favorite gluten-free frosting or enjoy it as is.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free strawberry cake turns out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use fresh strawberries:</strong> Fresh strawberries will give your cake the best flavor and texture. If you must use frozen strawberries, make sure to thaw and drain them well before adding to the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Ovens can vary, so start checking your cake for doneness a few minutes before the recommended baking time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen strawberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries, but make sure to thaw and drain them well before adding them to the batter. Excess moisture can affect the texture of the cake.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the buttermilk with a dairy-free alternative like almond milk or coconut milk. You can also use a dairy-free butter substitute.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This recipe works well with other fruits like blueberries, raspberries, or even a mix of your favorite berries.</p>
