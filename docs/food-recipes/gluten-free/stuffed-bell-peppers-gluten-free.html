    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Bell Peppers</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes. Rinse them thoroughly and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, sautéing until softened. If using ground meat, add it to the skillet and cook until browned. Stir in the cooked quinoa or rice, tomato sauce, and season with salt and pepper. Mix well and let the filling simmer for a few minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Stuff the Peppers</h3>
    <p>Fill each bell pepper with the prepared mixture, pressing down gently to pack it in. If desired, sprinkle shredded cheese on top of each pepper.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Peppers</h3>
    <p>Place the stuffed peppers in a baking dish and cover with foil. Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the filling is heated through.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Remove the peppers from the oven and let them cool slightly. Garnish with fresh herbs and serve warm.</p>
