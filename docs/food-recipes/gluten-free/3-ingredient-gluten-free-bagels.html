    <h1>3-Ingredient Gluten-Free Bagels: A Simple and Healthy Recipe</h1>
    <p>Bagels are a beloved breakfast staple, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional bagels can be off-limits. Fortunately, making gluten-free bagels at home is easier than you might think. With just three simple ingredients, you can whip up a batch of delicious, chewy, and satisfying gluten-free bagels that are perfect for any meal of the day. In this article, we’ll explore the recipe, tips for success, and answer some frequently asked questions about gluten-free bagels.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Bagels?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free bagels are not only a great option for those with gluten intolerance but also for anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake. Traditional bagels are made with wheat flour, which contains gluten—a protein that can cause digestive issues for some people. By using gluten-free ingredients, you can enjoy the same texture and flavor without the discomfort. Plus, making your own bagels allows you to control the ingredients, ensuring they are free from additives and preservatives.</p>

    <h2>The 3-Ingredient Gluten-Free Bagel Recipe</h2>
    <p>This recipe is incredibly simple and requires only three ingredients: gluten-free self-rising flour, Greek yogurt, and an egg. The result is a soft, chewy bagel that’s perfect for toasting, spreading with your favorite toppings, or enjoying on its own.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <th>Ingredient</th>
            <th>Quantity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Gluten-Free Self-Rising Flour</td>
            <td>1 ½ cups</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Greek Yogurt (plain, non-fat)</td>
            <td>1 cup</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Egg (for egg wash)</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven</strong> to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dough:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free self-rising flour and Greek yogurt. Stir until a dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the bagels:</strong> Divide the dough into 4 equal parts. Roll each part into a ball, then use your thumb to poke a hole in the center and shape it into a bagel.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the egg wash:</strong> Beat the egg in a small bowl and brush it over the top of each bagel. This will give them a golden, shiny finish.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the bagels on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Let the bagels cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving with your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Bagels</h2>
    <p>While this recipe is straightforward, here are a few tips to ensure your bagels turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use high-quality gluten-free flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a self-rising gluten-free flour blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense bagels. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with toppings:</strong> Before baking, you can sprinkle your bagels with sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or everything bagel seasoning for added flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> These bagels are best enjoyed fresh, but they can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Bagels</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>No, regular flour contains gluten, which is what we’re trying to avoid in this recipe. Stick to a gluten-free self-rising flour blend for the best results.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a dairy-free yogurt?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the Greek yogurt with a dairy-free alternative like coconut or almond yogurt. Just make sure it’s unsweetened and has a similar thick consistency.</p>

        <h3>Why do I need to use self-rising flour?</h3>
        <p>Self-rising flour already contains baking powder and salt, which helps the bagels rise and gives them a light, airy texture. If you don’t have self-rising flour, you can make your own by adding 1 ½ teaspoons of baking powder and ¼ teaspoon of salt to 1 cup of gluten-free flour.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these bagels vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make vegan gluten-free bagels by using a plant-based yogurt and skipping the egg wash. Instead, you can brush the bagels with a little almond milk or olive oil before baking.</p>
