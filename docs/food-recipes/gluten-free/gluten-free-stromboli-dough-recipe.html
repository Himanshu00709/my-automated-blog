</table>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Activate the Yeast</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, combine the warm water (around 110°F) with the sugar and yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy. This indicates that the yeast is active and ready to use.</p>

<h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, xanthan gum, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the dough.</p>

<h3>3. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Add the activated yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Mix everything together using a wooden spoon or a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment. Continue mixing until a soft dough forms. If the dough feels too dry, add a tablespoon of water at a time until it reaches the desired consistency.</p>

<h3>4. Knead the Dough</h3>
<p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Gluten-free dough may not stretch as much as traditional dough, but it should still hold together well.</p>

<h3>5. Let the Dough Rise</h3>
<p>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size. This step is crucial for developing the dough’s texture and flavor.</p>

<h3>6. Roll Out the Dough</h3>
<p>Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Roll it out on a floured surface into a rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick. This will serve as the base for your stromboli filling.</p>

<h3>7. Add Fillings and Roll</h3>
<p>Spread your desired fillings (such as cheese, pepperoni, vegetables, or sauce) evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Carefully roll the dough into a log, starting from one of the longer sides. Seal the edges by pinching the dough together.</p>

<h3>8. Bake the Stromboli</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer the rolled stromboli to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the top with olive oil and make a few small slits on the surface to allow steam to escape. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Stromboli</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a high-quality gluten-free all-purpose flour blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch for the best results.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Xanthan Gum:</strong> Xanthan gum is essential for binding the dough and giving it the elasticity that gluten would normally provide.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the Dough Rest:</strong> Allowing the dough to rise properly is key to achieving a light and airy texture. Be patient and give it enough time to double in size.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Fillings:</strong> Stromboli is versatile, so feel free to get creative with your fillings. Try combinations like spinach and feta, ham and cheese, or even a breakfast stromboli with eggs and bacon.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Stromboli Dough</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough in advance and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Just make sure to let it come to room temperature before rolling it out.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I freeze gluten-free stromboli dough?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! After the dough has risen, you can wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and freeze it for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before using.</p>

    <h3>3. What’s the best way to reheat stromboli?</h3>
    <p>To reheat stromboli, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until heated through. Avoid using the microwave, as it can make the crust soggy.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I use a different binder instead of xanthan gum?</h3>
    <p>If you don’t have xanthan gum, you can try using guar gum or psyllium husk as a substitute. However, keep in mind that the texture may vary slightly.</p>
</div>

<p>Making gluten-free stromboli dough is easier than you might think, and the results are incredibly rewarding. With the right ingredients and techniques, you can create a stromboli that is just as delicious and satisfying as the traditional version.
