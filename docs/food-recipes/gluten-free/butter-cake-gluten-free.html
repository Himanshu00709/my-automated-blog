    <h1>Gluten-Free Butter Cake: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>Butter cake is a classic dessert loved by many for its rich, buttery flavor and tender crumb. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying traditional butter cake can be a challenge.

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Digestive Health:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, gluten-free butter cake can prevent digestive discomfort and other related symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich Ingredients:</strong> Many gluten-free flours, such as almond flour or coconut flour, are rich in nutrients like protein, fiber, and healthy fats.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Gluten-free butter cake can be customized with various flavors, toppings, and fillings, making it a versatile dessert option.</li>
        <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> It allows everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions, to enjoy a delicious slice of cake.</li>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch round cake pan.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Butter Cake</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free butter cake turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. A blend of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch often works well for cakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Using room temperature butter and eggs helps create a smoother batter and better texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can sometimes bake faster than traditional cakes, so keep an eye on the baking time and check for doneness with a toothpick.</li>
    </ul>
