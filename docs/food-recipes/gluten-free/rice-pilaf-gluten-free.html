    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming sticky.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or pot, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until it becomes translucent, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic, diced carrots, and celery to the skillet. Cook for another 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften.</li>
        <li>Add the rinsed rice to the skillet and stir to coat it with the oil and vegetables. Toast the rice for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Pour in the gluten-free broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork, season with salt, pepper, and any optional herbs or spices, and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
