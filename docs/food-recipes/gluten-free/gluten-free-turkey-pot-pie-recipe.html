    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by making the gluten-free crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and a pinch of salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Divide the dough into two equal portions, wrap them in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the filling. In a large skillet, sauté the diced onion and minced garlic in a bit of olive oil until softened. Add the cooked turkey, frozen vegetables, broth, heavy cream, thyme, salt, and pepper. Stir well and let the mixture simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Pot Pie</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out one portion of the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface to fit the bottom of your pie dish. Carefully transfer the dough to the dish and press it into place. Pour the turkey filling into the crust. Roll out the second portion of dough and place it over the filling. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges to seal. Cut a few small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape. Brush the top crust with an egg wash (beaten egg mixed with a tablespoon of water) for a golden finish.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the pot pie in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let it cool for about 10 minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use store-bought gluten-free pie crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a store-bought gluten-free pie crust if you’re short on time. However, making your own crust allows you to control the ingredients and ensures a fresher taste.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter in the crust with a dairy-free alternative, and use a plant-based cream in place of heavy cream. Just make sure to check the labels to ensure all ingredients are gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this pot pie?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the unbaked pot pie. Assemble the pie as directed, but do not bake it. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, then freeze for up to 2 months. When ready to bake, thaw in the refrigerator overnight and bake as directed.</p>
