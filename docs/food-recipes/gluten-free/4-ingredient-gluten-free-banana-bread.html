    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step instructions for making this delicious banana bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your banana bread bakes evenly and rises properly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mash the Bananas</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas until they are smooth. You can use a fork or a potato masher for this step. The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more flavorful your bread will be.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Remaining Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Once the bananas are mashed, add the almond flour, eggs, and maple syrup to the bowl. Mix everything together until well combined. The batter should be thick but pourable.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Pour the Batter into a Loaf Pan</h3>

    <p>Grease a loaf pan with a little bit of oil or line it with parchment paper. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, spreading it out evenly with a spatula.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Banana Bread</h3>

    <p>Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The baking time may vary depending on your oven, so keep an eye on it after the 35-minute mark.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>

    <p>Once the banana bread is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing and serving.</p>

    <h2>Customization Ideas</h2>

    <p>One of the best things about this 4-ingredient gluten-free banana bread is how easy it is to customize. Here are a few ideas to get you started:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chocolate Chips:</strong> Add 1/2 cup of gluten-free chocolate chips to the batter for a sweet and indulgent twist.</li>
        <li><strong>Nuts:</strong> Stir in 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans for added crunch and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Dried Fruit:</strong> Mix in 1/2 cup of dried cranberries, raisins, or chopped dates for a fruity touch.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices:</strong> Add a teaspoon of cinnamon or nutmeg to the batter for a warm, spiced flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with another gluten-free flour, such as oat flour or coconut flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>To make this recipe vegan, you can replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons of water per egg). The texture may be slightly different, but it will still be delicious.</p>
