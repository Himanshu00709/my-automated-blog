    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to make your gluten-free monster cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free rolled oats, gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugars:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, peanut butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Chocolate Chips and M&M's:</strong> Gently fold in the chocolate chips and M&M's until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and Bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Flatten slightly with your hand or the back of a spoon. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Monster Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free monster cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky, chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before scooping and baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to customize your cookies with different add-ins like nuts, dried fruit, or white chocolate chips.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the cookies to be gluten-free. However, if you're making these cookies for someone with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it's important to stick with a gluten-free flour blend.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these cookies dairy-free by using a dairy-free butter substitute and ensuring that your chocolate chips and M&M's are also dairy-free.</p>

        <p>Yes, you can substitute peanut butter with almond butter, cashew butter, or any other nut butter of your choice. Just keep in mind that the flavor will vary slightly depending on the nut butter you use.</p>
