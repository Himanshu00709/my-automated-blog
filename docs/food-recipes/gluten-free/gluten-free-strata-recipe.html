    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Bread:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Cut the gluten-free bread into 1-inch cubes and spread them out on a baking sheet. Toast the bread in the oven for about 10 minutes, or until it’s slightly crispy. This step helps prevent the bread from becoming too soggy when mixed with the custard.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Vegetables:</strong> While the bread is toasting, heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the diced red onion and minced garlic, and sauté for 2-3 minutes until fragrant. Add the chopped spinach and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Custard:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and black pepper until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Strata:</strong> In a greased 9x13 inch baking dish, layer half of the toasted bread cubes. Top with half of the sautéed vegetables, cherry tomatoes, and shredded cheese. Repeat the layers with the remaining bread, vegetables, and cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour the Custard:</strong> Slowly pour the egg mixture over the layered ingredients, making sure to evenly distribute it. Press down gently on the bread to ensure it absorbs the custard.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill (Optional):</strong> If you’re preparing the strata the night before, cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. This allows the bread to fully absorb the custard, resulting in a richer flavor and texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) if it’s not already on. Bake the strata for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the custard is set. Let it cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this strata dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make this strata dairy-free by using a dairy-free milk alternative (such as almond milk or oat milk) and a dairy-free cheese substitute. Just ensure that the cheese you choose melts well for the best texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I add meat to this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Cooked bacon, sausage, or ham can be added to the strata for extra protein and flavor. Simply layer the cooked meat with the bread and vegetables before pouring the custard over the top.</p>

        <h3>How long does a strata last in the fridge?</h3>
        <p>A strata can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. To reheat, simply place individual portions in the microwave or warm the entire dish in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until heated through.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze a strata?</h3>
        <p>Yes, a strata can be frozen for up to 2 months. To freeze, wrap the baked and cooled strata tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil. When ready to eat, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and reheat in the oven.</p>
