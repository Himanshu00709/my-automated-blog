<h2>Basic Gluten-Free Rye Bread Recipe</h2>

<p>Here’s a simple recipe to get you started on your gluten-free rye bread journey:</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
    <li>1 cup gluten-free rye flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp xanthan gum</li>
    <li>1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
    <li>2 tbsp molasses</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp caraway seeds (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, rye flour, xanthan gum, and salt. Mix well.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until frothy.</li>
    <li>Add the molasses and olive oil to the yeast mixture, then pour it into the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>Fold in the caraway seeds if using, then transfer the dough to a greased loaf pan.</li>
    <li>Cover the dough with a clean towel and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the bread for 35-40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Allow the bread to cool before slicing and serving.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Rye Bread</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free bread can be tricky, but these tips will help you achieve the best results:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a Kitchen Scale:</strong> Measuring ingredients by weight ensures accuracy, which is crucial for gluten-free baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the Dough Rest:</strong> Allowing the dough to rest before baking helps the flours absorb moisture, improving texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add seeds, nuts, or spices to customize your bread to your taste.</li>
    <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Gluten-free bread tends to dry out faster. Store it in an airtight container or freeze slices for longer shelf life.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Rye Bread</h2>
