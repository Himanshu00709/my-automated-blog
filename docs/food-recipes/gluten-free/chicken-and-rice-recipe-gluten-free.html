    <p>Follow these simple steps to prepare your gluten-free chicken and rice:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong> Season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, paprika, and turmeric. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook the chicken until golden brown on both sides (about 5-6 minutes per side). Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Vegetables:</strong> In the same skillet, add the diced onion, bell pepper, and minced garlic. Sauté until softened, about 3-4 minutes.</li>

Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine and Serve:</strong> Slice the cooked chicken and place it on top of the rice. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve warm.</li>
