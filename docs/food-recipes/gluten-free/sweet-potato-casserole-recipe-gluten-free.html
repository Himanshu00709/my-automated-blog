    <h1>Gluten-Free Sweet Potato Casserole: A Delicious and Healthy Holiday Treat</h1>
    <p>Sweet potato casserole is a classic dish that graces many holiday tables. Its creamy texture, combined with the sweetness of the potatoes and the crunch of the topping, makes it a favorite among both kids and adults. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, traditional recipes can be off-limits due to the use of flour or other gluten-containing ingredients. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can create a gluten-free sweet potato casserole that is just as delicious and satisfying as the original.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Sweet Potato Casserole?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Even if you don't have a gluten intolerance, opting for a gluten-free version of this dish can be a healthier choice, as it often involves using whole, unprocessed ingredients. Sweet potatoes themselves are naturally gluten-free and packed with nutrients like vitamin A, vitamin C, and fiber. By making a gluten-free casserole, you can enjoy all the flavors of the traditional dish without compromising your dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Sweet Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into large chunks. Place the chunks in a large pot of boiling water and cook until they are tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain the water and mash the sweet potatoes until smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the mashed sweet potatoes with the unsalted butter, brown sugar, milk, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix until all the ingredients are well incorporated. Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free flour blend, chopped pecans, and maple syrup. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the top of the sweet potato mixture in the baking dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the casserole is heated through. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Sweet Potato Casserole</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Sweet Potatoes:</strong> Look for sweet potatoes that are firm and free of blemishes. The fresher the potatoes, the better the flavor of your casserole.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that is specifically designed for baking to ensure the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> When combining the ingredients, mix just until everything is incorporated. Overmixing can lead to a dense casserole.</li>
        <li><strong>Add a Touch of Spice:</strong> For an extra layer of flavor, consider adding a pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg to the sweet potato mixture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make this recipe dairy-free by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using almond milk or another non-dairy milk in place of regular milk.</p>

        <h3>Can I prepare this casserole ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the casserole up to the point of baking, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours. When you're ready to bake, simply remove the plastic wrap and bake as directed.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of pecans for the topping?</h3>
        <p>If you're not a fan of pecans, you can use walnuts, almonds, or even gluten-free oats for the topping. Each option will provide a different texture and flavor profile.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can be made vegan by using plant-based butter, non-dairy milk, and a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) in place of the eggs.</p>
