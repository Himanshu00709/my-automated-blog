    <h1>Sweet and Sour Chicken Gluten-Free: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>Sweet and sour chicken is a classic dish that has been enjoyed by many for decades. Its perfect balance of tangy and sweet flavors, combined with tender pieces of chicken, makes it a favorite in Chinese cuisine. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying this dish can be a challenge due to the traditional use of soy sauce and other gluten-containing ingredients. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can create a gluten-free version of sweet and sour chicken that is just as delicious and satisfying.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Adopting a gluten-free diet is essential for managing these conditions. Additionally, some people choose to go gluten-free for other health reasons, such as reducing inflammation or improving digestion. Whatever the reason, it's important to find gluten-free alternatives for your favorite dishes, including sweet and sour chicken.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the cooking process. Follow these steps to create a mouthwatering gluten-free sweet and sour chicken:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Start by cutting the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces. In a bowl, toss the chicken pieces with cornstarch until they are evenly coated. This will help create a crispy exterior when the chicken is fried.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Fry the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the coated chicken pieces in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry the chicken until it is golden brown and cooked through, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Sweet and Sour Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, whisk together the gluten-free soy sauce, rice vinegar, ketchup, and honey. This mixture will serve as the base for your sweet and sour sauce. Set it aside for now.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add a bit more oil if needed, and saut√© the sliced onions, bell peppers, and minced garlic until they are tender but still crisp, about 3-4 minutes. Add the pineapple chunks and cook for an additional 2 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Everything</h3>
    <p>Return the fried chicken to the skillet with the vegetables. Pour the sweet and sour sauce over the chicken and vegetables, stirring to coat everything evenly. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once everything is heated through and well-coated with the sauce, remove the skillet from the heat. Serve your gluten-free sweet and sour chicken over steamed rice or quinoa for a complete meal. Garnish with chopped green onions or sesame seeds if desired.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the chicken with pork, shrimp, or even tofu for a vegetarian option. Just make sure to adjust the cooking time accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Is there a substitute for cornstarch?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use cornstarch, you can use arrowroot powder or tapioca starch as a gluten-free alternative for coating the chicken.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the sweet and sour chicken ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat it in a skillet or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>What can I serve with gluten-free sweet and sour chicken?</h3>
        <p>This dish pairs well with steamed rice, quinoa, or even cauliflower rice for a low-carb option. You can also serve it with a side of stir-fried vegetables or a fresh salad.</p>
