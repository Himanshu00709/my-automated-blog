    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not only for those with celiac disease but also for individuals with gluten sensitivities or those looking to reduce inflammation.

By using gluten-free pasta and a simple, flour-free cheese sauce made with Velveeta, you can enjoy this beloved dish without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Gluten-Free Pasta</h3>
    <p>Start by boiling a large pot of salted water. Add the gluten-free elbow pasta and cook according to the package instructions, usually about 8-10 minutes. Be sure not to overcook the pasta, as gluten-free varieties can become mushy if left in the water too long. Once cooked, drain the pasta and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Cheese Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the milk and stir to combine. Cut the Velveeta cheese into small cubes and add them to the saucepan. Stir continuously until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Pasta and Sauce</h3>
    <p>Add the cooked gluten-free pasta to the cheese sauce and stir until the pasta is evenly coated. If you prefer a baked mac and cheese, transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish and top with gluten-free breadcrumbs. Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden and crispy.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once your gluten-free mac and cheese is ready, serve it hot and enjoy! This dish pairs well with a side salad or steamed vegetables for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Pasta:</strong> Not all gluten-free pastas are created equal. Look for brands that use a blend of rice, corn, and quinoa for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook the Sauce:</strong> Velveeta melts quickly, so keep the heat on medium and stir constantly to avoid burning.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Extra Flavor:</strong> Consider adding a pinch of garlic powder, paprika, or mustard powder to the cheese sauce for an extra layer of flavor.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute Velveeta with other gluten-free cheese options like cheddar or gouda. However, Velveeta is preferred for its creamy texture and easy melting properties.</p>

        <h3>Is Velveeta gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, Velveeta is gluten-free, but always check the label to ensure there are no changes in ingredients or manufacturing processes.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>While Velveeta is a dairy product, you can experiment with dairy-free cheese alternatives and non-dairy milk. Keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop, adding a splash of milk to restore creaminess.</p>
