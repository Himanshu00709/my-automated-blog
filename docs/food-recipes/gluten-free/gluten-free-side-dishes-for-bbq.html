    <h1>Gluten-Free Side Dishes for BBQ: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Barbecues are a staple of summer gatherings, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding the right side dishes can be a challenge. Gluten-free diets require careful attention to ingredients, but that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice flavor or variety. In this guide, we'll explore a range of gluten-free side dishes that are perfect for your next BBQ. From classic favorites to innovative new recipes, these dishes will ensure everyone at your table can enjoy a delicious and safe meal.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Matters</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. As a result, it's crucial to provide gluten-free options at social gatherings, especially when food is a central part of the event, like a BBQ.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free BBQ Side Dish Ideas</h2>

    <h3>1. Grilled Vegetables</h3>

    <p>Grilled vegetables are a simple yet flavorful addition to any BBQ. You can use a variety of vegetables such as zucchini, bell peppers, eggplant, and asparagus. Toss them in olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and grill until tender. For added flavor, consider marinating the vegetables in a gluten-free dressing before grilling.</p>

    <h3>2. Quinoa Salad</h3>

    <p>Quinoa is a gluten-free grain that's packed with protein and fiber. A quinoa salad can be made with a variety of ingredients, such as cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, and feta cheese. Dress the salad with a simple vinaigrette made from olive oil, lemon juice, and fresh herbs. This dish is not only gluten-free but also a healthy and satisfying option for your BBQ.</p>

    <h3>3. Corn on the Cob</h3>

    <p>Corn on the cob is a classic BBQ side dish that's naturally gluten-free. Simply grill the corn until it's slightly charred and tender, then brush it with butter and sprinkle with salt. For a twist, try adding a sprinkle of chili powder or a squeeze of lime juice for extra flavor.</p>

    <h3>4. Sweet Potato Fries</h3>

    <p>Sweet potato fries are a delicious and gluten-free alternative to traditional French fries. Cut sweet potatoes into thin strips, toss them in olive oil, and bake or fry until crispy. Serve with a gluten-free dipping sauce, such as aioli or ketchup, for a crowd-pleasing side dish.</p>

    <h3>5. Coleslaw</h3>

    <p>Coleslaw is a refreshing side dish that pairs perfectly with BBQ. To make a gluten-free version, use a mayonnaise-based dressing and ensure that all ingredients, including the mayonnaise and vinegar, are gluten-free. Add shredded cabbage, carrots, and a touch of sugar for a classic coleslaw that everyone will love.</p>
