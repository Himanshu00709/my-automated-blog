    <h2>Classic Gluten-Free Vanilla Bundt Cake Recipe</h2>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Bundt Cakes</h2>

    <p>Baking a gluten-free bundt cake requires some extra attention to detail. Here are some tips to ensure success:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Grease the Pan Thoroughly:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be more delicate, so make sure to grease every nook and cranny of your bundt pan to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix the batter until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let It Cool:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing it. This helps it set and reduces the risk of breaking.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add citrus zest, chocolate chips, or spices like cinnamon to customize your cake.</li>
    </ul>
