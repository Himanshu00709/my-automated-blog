    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Activate the Yeast:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy.</li>

        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Add the activated yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Dough Rise:</strong> Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Roll out the dough on a parchment-lined baking sheet to your desired thickness.</li>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cornmeal Pizza Dough</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use cornmeal alone for pizza dough?</h3>
        <p>While cornmeal can be used alone, it’s best to combine it with other gluten-free flours to achieve a more pliable and cohesive dough. Cornmeal alone may result in a crumbly texture.</p>

        <h3>Is xanthan gum necessary?</h3>
        <p>Xanthan gum acts as a binding agent in gluten-free baking, helping to mimic the elasticity of gluten. It’s highly recommended for achieving the right texture in your dough.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Allow it to come to room temperature before shaping and baking.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free cornmeal pizza dough?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can freeze the dough for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before using.</p>
