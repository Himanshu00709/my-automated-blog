    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Cranberry Bars</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free cranberry bars.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, rolled oats, coconut sugar, and salt. Add the melted butter and vanilla extract, and mix until the dough comes together. Press two-thirds of the mixture into the bottom of a greased 9x9 inch baking pan to form the crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Cranberry Filling</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, combine the cranberries, maple syrup, and a splash of water. Cook over medium heat until the cranberries burst and the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Bars</h3>
    <p>Spread the cranberry filling evenly over the crust. Crumble the remaining dough mixture over the top of the cranberry layer, creating a streusel-like topping.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake and Cool</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. Allow the bars to cool completely in the pan before cutting them into squares.</p>
