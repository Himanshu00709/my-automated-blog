    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free turkey and dumplings.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dumpling Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Add the cold butter pieces and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the milk, stirring until a soft dough forms. Be careful not to overmix. Cover the dough and set it aside while you prepare the soup base.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Soup Base</h3>
    <p>In a large pot, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced vegetables and sauté until they begin to soften, about 5-7 minutes. Add the cooked turkey, broth, and fresh herbs. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Dumplings</h3>
    <p>Once the soup base is simmering, it’s time to add the dumplings. Using a spoon or your hands, drop small portions of the dough into the simmering soup. Be sure to space them out so they have room to expand. Cover the pot and let the dumplings cook for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are cooked through and fluffy.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the dumplings are cooked, ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with additional fresh herbs if desired. Serve hot and enjoy the comforting flavors of this gluten-free twist on a classic dish.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Turkey and Dumplings</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While turkey is the traditional choice, you can easily substitute it with chicken, beef, or even a plant-based protein like tofu or tempeh.</p>

        <h3>What if I don’t have a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have a pre-made gluten-free flour blend, you can make your own by combining rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch. Adding xanthan gum will help improve the texture of the dumplings.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the soup base ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to two days. When you’re ready to serve, simply reheat the soup and add the dumplings as directed.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can be made dairy-free by using a dairy-free milk alternative and substituting the butter with a plant-based option like coconut oil or vegan butter.</p>
