<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Combine the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the brown rice flour, cornstarch, onion powder, garlic powder, bouillon powder, dried thyme, black pepper, and salt. Whisk thoroughly to ensure all ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Store the Mix</h3>
<p>Transfer the mixture to an airtight container or a resealable bag. Store it in a cool, dry place. This mix can last for up to 6 months if stored properly.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Prepare the Gravy</h3>
<p>To make the gravy, mix 1/4 cup of the gravy mix with 2 cups of cold water in a saucepan. Whisk continuously to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the gravy thickens to your desired consistency.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Gravy</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Cold Water:</strong> Mixing the gravy mix with cold water before heating helps prevent lumps.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust Consistency:</strong> If the gravy is too thick, add a little more water. If it’s too thin, simmer it longer or add a small amount of additional gravy mix.</li>
    <li><strong>Customize the Flavor:</strong> Feel free to add herbs like rosemary or sage for a unique twist.</li>
</ul>
