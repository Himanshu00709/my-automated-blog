    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions for making gluten-free cheese straws.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent the cheese straws from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, salt, paprika, and cayenne pepper (if using). Whisk the ingredients together until they are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Butter and Cheese</h3>
    <p>Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Next, add the grated cheddar cheese and mix until the dough starts to come together.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Cold Water</h3>
    <p>Gradually add cold water, one tablespoon at a time, to the dough mixture. Mix until the dough forms a ball. Be careful not to overwork the dough, as this can make the cheese straws tough.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>Place the dough on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Roll the dough out into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Use a sharp knife or a pizza cutter to cut the dough into thin strips, about 1/2 inch wide.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Twist and Bake</h3>
    <p>Gently twist each strip of dough and place it on the prepared baking sheet. Leave a little space between each straw to allow for even baking. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the cheese straws are golden brown and crispy.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cheese straws to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve your gluten-free cheese straws as a snack or appetizer, and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cheese Straws</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free cheese straws is relatively simple, but here are a few tips to ensure they turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Ingredients:</strong> Cold butter and water help create a flaky texture in the dough. Make sure your butter is straight from the fridge.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overwork the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cheese straws. Mix just until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add other spices or herbs to the dough, such as garlic powder, rosemary, or thyme, to customize the flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Store your gluten-free cheese straws in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to a month.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cheese Straws</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other types of cheese, such as Parmesan, Gouda, or even a blend of cheeses. Just make sure the cheese is finely grated so it incorporates well into the dough.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cheese straws dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>If you’re looking for a dairy-free version, you can try using a dairy-free cheese alternative and a plant-based butter. However, keep in mind that the flavor and texture may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Are gluten-free cheese straws suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Traditional cheese straws are not vegan due to the cheese and butter. However, you can experiment with vegan cheese and butter substitutes to create a vegan-friendly version.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days before baking. Alternatively, you can bake the cheese straws and store them in an airtight container for a few days.</p>
