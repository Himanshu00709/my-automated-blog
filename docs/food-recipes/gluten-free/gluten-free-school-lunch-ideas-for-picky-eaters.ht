<h1>Gluten-Free School Lunch Ideas for Picky Eaters</h1>

<p>Packing a school lunch that is both gluten-free and appealing to picky eaters can feel like a daunting task. However, with a little creativity and planning, you can create meals that are nutritious, delicious, and safe for children with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. This blog post will provide you with a variety of gluten-free school lunch ideas that even the pickiest eaters will love.</p>

<h2>Why Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For children with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term complications. Even for children without these conditions, a gluten-free diet can sometimes be beneficial for overall health. However, it's important to ensure that gluten-free meals are still balanced and provide all the necessary nutrients for growing kids.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Lunch Ideas</h2>

<h3>1. Gluten-Free Sandwiches</h3>

<p>Sandwiches are a classic lunch option, and they can easily be made gluten-free by using gluten-free bread. Look for bread that is soft and similar in texture to regular bread to make it more appealing to picky eaters. Here are some filling ideas:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Turkey and cheese with lettuce and mayo</li>
    <li>Peanut butter and jelly (use a gluten-free jelly)</li>
    <li>Chicken salad with grapes and celery</li>
</ul>

<p>For an extra twist, try using gluten-free wraps or lettuce wraps instead of bread.</p>

<h3>2. Gluten-Free Pasta Salads</h3>

        <th>Quantity</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

<h3>3. Gluten-Free Snack Boxes</h3>

        <th>Item</th>
        <th>Quantity</th>
    </tr>

        <td>1</td>
    </tr>

<h3>4. Gluten-Free Muffins and Baked Goods</h3>
