    <h1>Gluten-Free Communion Wafer Recipe: A Guide for Inclusive Worship</h1>
    <p>Communion is a sacred ritual in many Christian traditions, symbolizing the body and blood of Christ. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, participating in this sacrament can be challenging due to the traditional use of wheat-based wafers. Fortunately, gluten-free communion wafers offer a solution, ensuring that everyone can partake in this meaningful practice. In this article, we’ll explore a simple and effective gluten-free communion wafer recipe, discuss its significance, and answer common questions about gluten-free communion.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Communion Wafers Matter</h2>
    <p>For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming even a small amount of gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Traditional communion wafers, made from wheat, contain gluten, making them unsuitable for individuals with these conditions. Gluten-free communion wafers provide a safe alternative, allowing everyone to participate in the sacrament without compromising their health.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Communion Wafers</h2>
    <p>Creating gluten-free communion wafers requires a few simple ingredients. Here’s what you’ll need:</p>

                <td>1/2 teaspoon</td>
                <td>Acts as a binder to replace gluten</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>1/4 teaspoon</td>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to make your own gluten-free communion wafers:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Set your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt. Stir until well mixed.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the wet ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the water and olive oil to the dry ingredients, stirring until a dough forms. The dough should be firm but pliable.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll out the dough:</strong> Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and roll it out as thinly as possible, aiming for a thickness of about 1/16 inch.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut the wafers:</strong> Use a small round cutter (about 1 inch in diameter) to cut out the wafers. Place them on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the wafers for 10-12 minutes, or until they are lightly golden and crisp. Allow them to cool completely before handling.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Storing and Serving Gluten-Free Communion Wafers</h2>
    <p>Once baked, gluten-free communion wafers can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. For longer storage, consider freezing them in a sealed bag. When serving, ensure that the wafers are handled with clean hands or utensils to prevent cross-contamination with gluten-containing products.</p>
