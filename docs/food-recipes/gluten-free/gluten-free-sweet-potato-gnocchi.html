    <h1>Gluten-Free Sweet Potato Gnocchi: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>Gnocchi, the soft and pillowy Italian dumplings, have long been a favorite comfort food. Traditionally made with wheat flour, gnocchi can be a challenge for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Enter <strong>gluten-free sweet potato gnocchi</strong>—a nutritious, flavorful, and easy-to-make alternative that satisfies both your taste buds and dietary needs. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of sweet potato gnocchi, provide a step-by-step recipe, and answer some frequently asked questions about this delightful dish.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Sweet Potato Gnocchi?</h2>

    <p>Sweet potatoes are a powerhouse of nutrition. They are rich in vitamins A and C, fiber, and antioxidants, making them an excellent base for gluten-free gnocchi. Unlike traditional gnocchi, which relies on wheat flour for structure, sweet potato gnocchi uses gluten-free flours like rice flour or almond flour. This not only makes the dish suitable for those avoiding gluten but also adds a unique, slightly sweet flavor that pairs beautifully with a variety of sauces.</p>

    <p>Additionally, sweet potatoes have a lower glycemic index compared to regular potatoes, making them a better option for those managing blood sugar levels. Their natural sweetness also reduces the need for added sugars, making this dish a healthier choice overall.</p>

                <td>Nutmeg (optional)</td>
                <td>¼ tsp</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>1 tbsp</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sweet Potatoes:</strong> Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Pierce the sweet potatoes with a fork and bake them for about 45-60 minutes, or until they are soft. Let them cool, then peel and mash them in a large bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> Add the gluten-free flour, egg, salt, and nutmeg (if using) to the mashed sweet potatoes. Mix until a dough forms. Be careful not to overwork the dough, as this can make the gnocchi tough.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Gnocchi:</strong> Divide the dough into small portions and roll each portion into a rope about 1 inch thick. Cut the ropes into 1-inch pieces. You can leave them as is or use a fork to create ridges, which help the sauce cling to the gnocchi.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Gnocchi:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi in batches and cook until they float to the surface, about 2-3 minutes. Remove them with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Toss the cooked gnocchi with your favorite sauce. A simple brown butter and sage sauce or a creamy garlic parmesan sauce works wonderfully. Drizzle with olive oil and serve immediately.</li>
