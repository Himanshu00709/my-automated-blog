    <h1>Gluten-Free Rainbow Cookies: A Colorful Delight</h1>
    <p>Rainbow cookies are a vibrant and delicious treat that can brighten up any occasion. Traditionally, these cookies are made with almond paste and layered with colorful marzipan, but for those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying these cookies can be a challenge. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can create gluten-free rainbow cookies that are just as delightful as the original. In this blog post, we’ll walk you through a step-by-step recipe for making gluten-free rainbow cookies that are not only visually stunning but also incredibly tasty.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Rainbow Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular, and for good reason. Many people have gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, which makes it essential to avoid gluten-containing ingredients. Gluten-free rainbow cookies are a perfect option for those who want to enjoy a classic treat without compromising their dietary needs. Additionally, these cookies are made with almond flour, which adds a rich, nutty flavor and a moist texture that is hard to resist.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2>
    <p>Before you start baking, it’s important to gather all the necessary ingredients. Here’s a list of what you’ll need to make gluten-free rainbow cookies:</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free rainbow cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour and powdered sugar. Mix well to ensure there are no lumps. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they become frothy. Add the almond extract to the egg whites and mix well. Gradually add the egg white mixture to the almond flour mixture, stirring until a smooth dough forms.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Divide and Color the Dough</h3>
    <p>Divide the dough into three equal portions. Add a few drops of red food coloring to one portion, green to another, and yellow to the third. Mix each portion thoroughly until the color is evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Layer the Dough</h3>
    <p>Line a baking pan with parchment paper and grease it lightly with butter. Press the red dough evenly into the bottom of the pan. Next, layer the yellow dough on top of the red layer, followed by the green dough. Make sure each layer is evenly spread and pressed down firmly.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the layered dough for about 15-20 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely in the pan.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cut and Coat with Chocolate</h3>
    <p>Once the baked dough has cooled, carefully remove it from the pan and cut it into small rectangular pieces. Melt the dark chocolate in a double boiler or microwave. Dip each cookie into the melted chocolate, coating the top and sides. Place the coated cookies on a wire rack to allow the chocolate to set.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use other types of flour instead of almond flour?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour is preferred for its rich flavor and moist texture, but you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary.</p>

        <h3>How long do these cookies last?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free rainbow cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. For longer storage, you can keep them in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the cookies?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cookies for up to three months. Make sure to wrap them tightly in plastic wrap or place them in a freezer-safe container. Thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use natural food coloring?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer natural food coloring, you can use beet juice for red, spinach powder for green, and turmeric for yellow. Keep in mind that natural colors may not be as vibrant as artificial ones.</p>
    </div>
