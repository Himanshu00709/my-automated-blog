    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Beef</h3>
    <p>Start by slicing the beef into thin strips. This will help the beef cook quickly and absorb the flavors of the sauce. In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of gluten-free soy sauce. Add the beef strips to the mixture, ensuring they are well-coated. Let the beef marinate for at least 15 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Broccoli</h3>
    <p>While the beef is marinating, steam the broccoli florets until they are tender but still crisp. This should take about 5 minutes. Once steamed, set the broccoli aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the remaining gluten-free soy sauce, minced garlic, minced ginger, honey, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes (if using). Mix well and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Beef</h3>
    <p>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the marinated beef strips and cook until they are browned on all sides, about 3-4 minutes. Remove the beef from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Everything</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the remaining olive oil and sauté the steamed broccoli for 2-3 minutes. Return the beef to the skillet and pour the sauce over the beef and broccoli. Stir well to combine and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve</h3>
    <p>Once everything is heated through, remove the skillet from the heat. Serve the gluten-free beef and broccoli over steamed rice or cauliflower rice for a complete meal. Garnish with sesame seeds or chopped green onions if desired.</p>
