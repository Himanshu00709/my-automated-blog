    <h1>Gluten-Free Protein Waffle Recipe: A Healthy Breakfast Delight</h1>
    <p>Breakfast is often referred to as the most important meal of the day, and for good reason. It sets the tone for your energy levels, metabolism, and overall well-being. If you're looking for a nutritious, gluten-free, and protein-packed breakfast option, you're in the right place.

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Protein Waffles?</h2>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Waffle Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, protein powder, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these dry ingredients together until well combined. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and then add the almond milk, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Mix the wet ingredients thoroughly before gradually incorporating them into the dry ingredients. Stir until the batter is smooth and free of lumps. If you prefer a sweeter waffle, add your choice of sweetener at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Preheat the Waffle Iron</h3>
    <p>While preparing the batter, preheat your waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lightly grease the waffle iron with a small amount of coconut oil or a non-stick cooking spray to prevent the waffles from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Waffles</h3>
    <p>Once the waffle iron is hot, pour the batter onto the center of the iron, using about 1/2 cup of batter per waffle. Close the lid and cook until the waffles are golden brown and crisp, usually about 3-5 minutes depending on your waffle iron. Avoid opening the lid too soon, as this can cause the waffles to tear.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Carefully remove the waffles from the iron and place them on a plate. Serve immediately with your favorite toppings, such as fresh berries, a drizzle of maple syrup, or a dollop of Greek yogurt. These waffles are best enjoyed fresh but can also be stored in an airtight container for up to 2 days or frozen for longer storage.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>
    <p>These gluten-free protein waffles are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. The gluten-free flour blend provides a source of complex carbohydrates, while the protein powder adds a significant boost of protein, essential for muscle repair and growth. The eggs contribute healthy fats and additional protein, and the almond milk offers a dairy-free alternative rich in vitamins and minerals. Coconut oil adds a touch of healthy fats, making this recipe a well-rounded breakfast option.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the gluten-free flour blend with other gluten-free flours like almond flour, oat flour, or coconut flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>What type of protein powder works best?</h3>
        <p>Whey protein powder, pea protein, or brown rice protein are all excellent choices. Make sure to use a high-quality protein powder that complements the flavor of your waffles.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these waffles ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the batter the night before and store it in the refrigerator. Alternatively, you can cook the waffles in advance and reheat them in a toaster or oven when ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>Are these waffles suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>To make this recipe vegan, replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and use a plant-based protein powder.</p>
