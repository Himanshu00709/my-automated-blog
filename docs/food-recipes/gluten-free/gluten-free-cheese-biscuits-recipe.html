<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent sticking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. If you’re using garlic powder, add it to the dry ingredients for an extra burst of flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cut in the Butter</h3>
<p>Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. This step is crucial for achieving a flaky texture.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Cheese and Milk</h3>
<p>Stir in the shredded cheddar cheese and chopped chives (if using). Gradually add the milk, stirring until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the biscuits dense.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Shape the Biscuits</h3>
<p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour). Gently pat the dough into a circle about 1 inch thick. Use a biscuit cutter or a glass to cut out biscuits. Place them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each biscuit.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
<p>Bake the biscuits in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cheese Biscuits</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Cold Butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for creating flaky layers in your biscuits. Avoid using softened or melted butter.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough biscuits. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Cheese:</strong> While cheddar cheese is a classic choice, feel free to experiment with other cheeses like Parmesan, Gouda, or pepper jack for different flavors.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Herbs:</strong> Fresh herbs like rosemary, thyme, or parsley can add a delightful aroma and taste to your biscuits.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flour blends, but make sure they are suitable for baking. Almond flour or oat flour can also work, but the texture may vary.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these biscuits dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a dairy-free milk such as almond or oat milk. For the cheese, opt for a dairy-free shredded cheese.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftover biscuits?</h3>
    <p>Store leftover biscuits in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, freeze them in a freezer-safe bag for up to 2 months. Reheat in the oven before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I add other ingredients to the dough?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Feel free to customize your biscuits by adding ingredients like cooked bacon, sun-dried tomatoes, or jalapeños for a spicy kick.</p>
