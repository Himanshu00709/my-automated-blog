    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your crockpot gluten-free mac and cheese:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong> Boil the gluten-free elbow pasta according to the package instructions, but reduce the cooking time by 1-2 minutes to ensure it doesn’t become too soft in the crockpot. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Sauce:</strong> In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the gluten-free flour blend and whisk until smooth. Gradually pour in the milk and heavy cream, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Cook until the mixture thickens, then remove from heat and stir in the shredded cheddar cheese until fully melted.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine in the Crockpot:</strong> Transfer the cooked pasta to the crockpot and pour the cheese sauce over it. Stir well to ensure the pasta is evenly coated. Add salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook on Low:</strong> Cover the crockpot and cook on low for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. The mac and cheese is ready when the sauce is bubbly and the pasta is tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Serve hot, garnished with additional shredded cheese or fresh herbs if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese</h2>
    <p>Here are some expert tips to elevate your crockpot gluten-free mac and cheese:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Pasta:</strong> Not all gluten-free pastas are created equal. Look for brands that hold their shape well during cooking, such as those made from brown rice or quinoa.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Freshly Shredded Cheese:</strong> Pre-shredded cheese often contains anti-caking agents that can affect the texture of your sauce. Shredding your own cheese ensures a smoother, creamier result.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Cheeses:</strong> While cheddar is a classic choice, feel free to mix in other cheeses like Gruyère, Monterey Jack, or Parmesan for added depth of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> For a crunchy contrast, top your mac and cheese with gluten-free breadcrumbs or crushed crackers before serving.</li>
    </ul>
