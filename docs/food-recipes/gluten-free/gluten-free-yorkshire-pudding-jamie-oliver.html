    </table>

    <p>These ingredients are simple and easy to find, making this recipe accessible for anyone looking to try their hand at gluten-free baking.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>

    <p>Jamie Oliver’s gluten-free Yorkshire pudding recipe is straightforward and easy to follow. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create this delicious dish:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F). Place a muffin tin or Yorkshire pudding tin in the oven to heat up. This step is crucial as it ensures that the oil or beef dripping is hot enough to create the signature puff in the pudding.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour and salt. Make a well in the center and crack in the eggs. Gradually whisk in the milk until you have a smooth, lump-free batter. Let the batter rest for at least 15 minutes. This resting period allows the flour to hydrate and ensures a lighter texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Heat the Oil</h3>
    <p>Carefully remove the hot tin from the oven and add a small amount of vegetable oil or beef dripping to each compartment. Return the tin to the oven for a few minutes until the oil is smoking hot.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Pour the Batter</h3>
    <p>Quickly pour the batter into the hot tin, filling each compartment about halfway. Be cautious as the oil may splatter. Immediately return the tin to the oven.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the Yorkshire puddings for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and puffed up. Avoid opening the oven door during baking, as this can cause the puddings to deflate.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the Yorkshire puddings from the oven and serve immediately. They are best enjoyed fresh and hot, alongside your favorite roast and gravy.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Yorkshire Puddings</h2>

    <p>While Jamie Oliver’s recipe is relatively simple, there are a few tips and tricks to ensure your gluten-free Yorkshire puddings turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Good Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right combination of starches and gums to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest the Batter:</strong> Allowing the batter to rest is essential for achieving a light and airy texture. This step gives the flour time to absorb the liquid and ensures a smoother batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Hot Oil is Key:</strong> The oil or beef dripping must be smoking hot before you add the batter. This creates the steam that causes the puddings to rise and puff up.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Open the Oven:</strong> Resist the temptation to open the oven door while the puddings are baking. The sudden drop in temperature can cause them to collapse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but the results may vary. A blend of rice flour, tapioca starch, and xanthan gum often works well for achieving a light and airy texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the batter ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the batter a few hours in advance and store it in the refrigerator. Just give it a good stir before using it.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free Yorkshire puddings?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze them once they have cooled completely. To reheat, simply place them in a preheated oven for a few minutes until they are warm and crispy.</p>

        <h3>What can I serve with gluten-free Yorkshire puddings?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free Yorkshire puddings are versatile and can be served with a variety of dishes. They pair beautifully with roast beef, chicken, or vegetables, and are often accompanied by gravy.</p>
