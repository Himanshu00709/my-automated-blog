    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free BBQ Meatballs</h2>

    <p>Now that you know the key ingredients, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free BBQ meatballs:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Meatball Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 pound of ground meat (beef, pork, or a mix), 1/2 cup of gluten-free breadcrumbs, 1 beaten egg, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. Mix thoroughly until all ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Shape the Meatballs</h3>
    <p>Using your hands or a small scoop, shape the mixture into 1-inch meatballs. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake or Cook the Meatballs</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the meatballs for 20-25 minutes, or until they reach an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). Alternatively, you can cook them in a skillet over medium heat until browned on all sides and cooked through.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the BBQ Sauce</h3>
    <p>Once the meatballs are cooked, transfer them to a large bowl and toss them with 1 cup of gluten-free BBQ sauce. Ensure each meatball is evenly coated. For extra flavor, you can return the coated meatballs to the oven for an additional 5-10 minutes to caramelize the sauce.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve your gluten-free BBQ meatballs as an appetizer, over rice, or with a side of roasted vegetables. Garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro for a pop of color and flavor.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free BBQ Meatballs</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose Quality Ingredients:</strong> Opt for high-quality ground meat and certified gluten-free products to ensure the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the meatball mixture can result in tough meatballs. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Cookie Scoop:</strong> A small cookie scoop can help you create uniformly sized meatballs, ensuring even cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add other seasonings or ingredients like grated Parmesan cheese, chopped herbs, or diced onions to customize the flavor.</li>
    </ul>
