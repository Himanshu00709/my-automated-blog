    <h1>Gluten-Free Mashed Potatoes Recipe</h1>
    <p>Mashed potatoes are a classic comfort food that can be enjoyed by everyone, including those who follow a gluten-free diet. Whether you're hosting a holiday dinner or simply craving a hearty side dish, this gluten-free mashed potatoes recipe is sure to satisfy. In this article, we'll walk you through the steps to create creamy, fluffy mashed potatoes that are completely free of gluten. We'll also address common questions and provide tips to ensure your dish is perfect every time.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Mashed Potatoes?</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, avoiding gluten is essential to maintaining good health. While potatoes are naturally gluten-free, some mashed potato recipes or pre-packaged mixes may contain hidden gluten in the form of additives or cross-contamination. By making your mashed potatoes from scratch, you can control the ingredients and ensure they are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Mashed Potatoes</h2>
    <p>To make gluten-free mashed potatoes, you'll need the following ingredients:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Quantity</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>

                <td>2 pounds</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Unsalted butter (or dairy-free alternative)</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>

                <td>1/2 teaspoon (or to taste)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Optional: Garlic powder, chives, or sour cream</td>

    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Start by peeling the potatoes and cutting them into evenly sized chunks. This ensures they cook uniformly. Rinse the potato chunks under cold water to remove excess starch, which can make the mashed potatoes gluey.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Boil the Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Place the potato chunks in a large pot and cover them with cold water. Add a pinch of salt to the water to enhance the flavor. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the potatoes for 15-20 minutes, or until they are fork-tender.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Drain and Mash</h3>
    <p>Once the potatoes are cooked, drain them thoroughly in a colander. Return the potatoes to the pot and mash them using a potato masher or a hand mixer. For extra creaminess, you can pass the potatoes through a ricer or food mill.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Butter and Milk</h3>
    <p>Add the butter to the mashed potatoes and stir until it melts. Gradually pour in the milk while continuing to mash or mix. The amount of milk can be adjusted based on your desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Customize Your Mashed Potatoes</h3>
    <p>If you'd like to add extra flavor, consider mixing in garlic powder, chopped chives, or a dollop of sour cream. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Mashed Potatoes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Potatoes:</strong> Russet potatoes are starchy and yield a fluffy texture, while Yukon Gold potatoes are creamier and slightly buttery.</li>
        <li><strong>Warm the Milk:</strong> Adding cold milk to hot potatoes can cool them down too quickly. Warm the milk slightly before mixing it in.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Over-Mixing:</strong> Over-mixing can cause the potatoes to become gummy. Mash just until smooth and creamy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Mashed Potatoes</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like margarine or coconut oil, and use unsweetened almond milk or another plant-based milk instead of whole milk.</p>

        <h3>Are all potatoes gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, potatoes are naturally gluten-free. However, always check for cross-contamination if you're using pre-packaged or processed potato products.</p>

        <h3>Can I make mashed potatoes ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare mashed potatoes a day in advance. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator and reheat them on the stovetop or in the microwave, adding a splash of milk to restore creaminess.</p>
    </div>

By following this simple recipe, you can create a creamy, flavorful dish that pairs perfectly with roasted meats, vegetables, or your favorite holiday meals.
