<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Instant Pot</h3>
<p>Start by adding the gluten-free elbow macaroni and water (or chicken broth) to the Instant Pot. Stir to ensure the pasta is evenly distributed and submerged in the liquid.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Pressure Cook</h3>
<p>Secure the lid on the Instant Pot and set the valve to the sealing position. Select the "Manual" or "Pressure Cook" setting and set the timer for 4 minutes. Once the cooking cycle is complete, allow the pressure to release naturally for 5 minutes, then perform a quick release for any remaining pressure.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add the Creamy Cheese Sauce</h3>
<p>Open the lid and stir in the heavy cream (or almond milk), butter, shredded cheddar, mozzarella, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Stir until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is creamy and smooth.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Optional Topping</h3>
<p>If you prefer a crispy topping, sprinkle gluten-free breadcrumbs over the mac and cheese and broil in the oven for 2-3 minutes until golden brown.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Serve your gluten-free mac and cheese hot, garnished with fresh herbs like parsley or chives if desired. This dish pairs perfectly with a side salad or steamed vegetables for a complete meal.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Choose the Right Pasta:</strong> Not all gluten-free pastas are created equal. Look for brands that hold up well under pressure cooking, such as those made from brown rice or quinoa.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Freshly Shredded Cheese:</strong> Pre-shredded cheese often contains anti-caking agents that can affect the texture of your sauce. For the creamiest results, shred your cheese from a block.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust Liquid Levels:</strong> If your mac and cheese seems too thick, add a splash of milk or broth to reach your desired consistency.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use dairy-free cheese in this recipe?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute dairy-free cheese and milk alternatives to make this recipe vegan-friendly. Just ensure the cheese melts well for a creamy texture.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop, adding a splash of milk to restore creaminess.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free mac and cheese?</h3>
    <p>While you can freeze this dish, the texture of the pasta may change upon thawing. For best results, consume it fresh or refrigerated.</p>

    <h3>What other gluten-free pasta shapes can I use?</h3>
    <p>You can use any gluten-free pasta shape, such as shells, penne, or fusilli. Adjust the cooking time as needed based on the pasta’s thickness.</p>
