    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Madeleine Pan</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease your madeleine pan with butter or a non-stick cooking spray. Dust the pan with a little gluten-free flour to ensure the madeleines release easily after baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Beat the Eggs and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and granulated sugar together until the mixture becomes pale and slightly thickened. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer. Add the vanilla extract and lemon zest (if using) and mix until combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the egg mixture, being careful not to overmix. Once the batter is smooth, slowly add the melted butter and mix until fully incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fill the Madeleine Pan</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into the prepared madeleine pan, filling each mold about three-quarters full. This will allow the madeleines to rise and form their characteristic hump.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Madeleines</h3>
    <p>Bake the madeleines in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are set. Remove the pan from the oven and let the madeleines cool for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Madeleines</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense madeleines. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the batter:</strong> For even better results, chill the batter in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before baking. This helps the madeleines develop their signature hump.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> While classic madeleines are flavored with vanilla and lemon zest, you can try adding other flavors like orange zest, almond extract, or even a sprinkle of cinnamon.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Madeleines</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. A blend of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch often works well.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these madeleines dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. Just make sure it’s melted and cooled before adding it to the batter.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free madeleines?</h3>
        <p>Store the madeleines in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 2 months. Just thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make mini madeleines?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a mini madeleine pan if you prefer smaller cakes. Just reduce the baking time to 8-10 minutes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free madeleines are a delightful treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and a little patience, you can create these classic French tea cakes that are just as tender and flavorful as the original. Whether you’re serving them with tea, coffee, or as a sweet snack, these gluten-free madeleines are sure to impress. Happy baking!</p>
