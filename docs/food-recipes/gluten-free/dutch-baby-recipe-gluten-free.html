    <p>A Dutch Baby, also known as a German pancake, is a baked pancake that puffs up dramatically in the oven. It has a custardy center and crispy edges, making it a delightful combination of textures. Traditionally, it's made with wheat flour, eggs, milk, and butter, but with the rise of gluten-free diets, many people are looking for alternatives that don't compromise on taste or texture.</p>

                <td>Salt</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vanilla extract (optional)</td>
                <td>1/2 teaspoon</td>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Place a 10-inch cast-iron skillet or oven-safe pan in the oven to heat up while you prepare the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>In a blender or mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, eggs, milk, salt, and vanilla extract (if using). Blend or whisk until the batter is smooth and free of lumps. Let the batter rest for 5-10 minutes to allow the gluten-free flour to hydrate.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Melt the Butter</h3>
    <p>Carefully remove the hot skillet from the oven and add the butter. Swirl the butter around the skillet until it's melted and coats the bottom and sides evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Pour the Batter</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the hot skillet with the melted butter. Immediately return the skillet to the oven.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Dutch Baby</h3>
    <p>Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the Dutch Baby is puffed up and golden brown around the edges. Avoid opening the oven door during baking, as this can cause the Dutch Baby to deflate.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the Dutch Baby from the oven. It will begin to deflate slightly, which is normal. Dust with powdered sugar and top with fresh fruit, syrup, or any other toppings you prefer. Serve immediately while warm.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Dutch Baby</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Resting Time:</strong> Allowing the batter to rest ensures that the gluten-free flour absorbs the liquid, resulting in a better texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Hot Skillet:</strong> Preheating the skillet is crucial for achieving the signature puffiness of a Dutch Baby.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> While powdered sugar and fresh fruit are classic toppings, feel free to get creative with whipped cream, nut butter, or even savory options like cheese and herbs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Variations to Try</h2>
    <p>Once you've mastered the basic gluten-free Dutch Baby, you can experiment with different flavors and ingredients. Here are a few ideas:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Variation</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Chocolate Dutch Baby</td>
                <td>Add 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder to the batter for a chocolatey twist.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Savory Dutch Baby</td>
                <td>Skip the sugar and vanilla, and add herbs, cheese, and cooked vegetables to the batter.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Apple Cinnamon Dutch Baby</td>
                <td>Add thinly sliced apples and a sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter before baking.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>Can I make a Dutch Baby without a cast-iron skillet?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any oven-safe pan, such as a ceramic or glass baking dish. However, a cast-iron skillet is preferred because it retains heat well, helping the Dutch Baby puff up.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the milk with a non-dairy alternative like almond milk or oat milk, and use a dairy-free butter substitute.</p>

        <h3>Why did my Dutch Baby deflate?</h3>
        <p>Dutch Babies naturally deflate after being removed from the oven. This is normal and doesn't affect the taste or texture. Avoid opening the oven door during baking to prevent premature deflation.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the batter ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>It's best to make the batter fresh, as the gluten-free flour needs time to hydrate. However, you can prepare the dry ingredients and wet ingredients separately the night before and combine them just before baking.</p>
    </div>

With a few simple substitutions, you can enjoy this classic dish without compromising on taste or texture. Whether you stick to the traditional recipe or experiment with different flavors, this gluten-free Dutch Baby is a delightful way to start your day.
