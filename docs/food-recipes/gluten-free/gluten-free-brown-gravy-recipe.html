    <p>Gravy is a staple in many households, especially during holiday meals or Sunday dinners.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Thickener</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch or arrowroot powder with cold water until it forms a smooth slurry. This will prevent lumps from forming in your gravy.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Heat the Broth</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized saucepan, heat the gluten-free beef or chicken broth over medium heat. Bring it to a gentle simmer.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Thickener</h3>
    <p>Slowly pour the cornstarch slurry into the simmering broth, stirring constantly. Continue to stir until the gravy thickens, which should take about 2-3 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Season the Gravy</h3>
    <p>Add the butter or olive oil, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper to the gravy. If you’re using soy sauce or tamari, add it at this stage as well. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Simmer and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the gravy to simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. Once the gravy reaches your desired consistency, remove it from the heat and serve immediately.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Gravy</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use high-quality broth:</strong> The flavor of your gravy largely depends on the broth you use. Opt for a high-quality, gluten-free beef or chicken broth for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the thickness:</strong> If your gravy is too thick, you can thin it out by adding a bit more broth. If it’s too thin, mix another tablespoon of cornstarch with cold water and stir it into the gravy.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Feel free to add herbs like thyme or rosemary, or a splash of red wine for added depth of flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Brown Gravy</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use flour alternatives like almond flour or coconut flour?</h3>
        <p>While almond flour and coconut flour are popular gluten-free alternatives, they are not ideal for thickening gravy. Cornstarch or arrowroot powder works best for achieving a smooth and consistent texture.</p>

        <h3>Is this gravy recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this gravy vegan by using olive oil instead of butter and ensuring that the broth and soy sauce are vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>How long can I store gluten-free gravy?</h3>
        <p>You can store leftover gravy in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat it on the stovetop or in the microwave, adding a bit of broth if it thickens too much.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free gravy?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free gravy freezes well. Pour it into a freezer-safe container and store it for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before reheating.</p>
    </div>
