<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cornbread and Bread</h3>

<p>Start by preparing your gluten-free cornbread. You can use a store-bought mix or make your own from scratch. Once baked, allow the cornbread to cool completely before crumbling it into a large mixing bowl. Similarly, cube your gluten-free bread and toast it in the oven until it's slightly dry. Add the toasted bread cubes to the crumbled cornbread.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>

<p>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, celery, and minced garlic. Sauté until the vegetables are soft and fragrant, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in the fresh sage and thyme, and season with salt and black pepper. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool slightly.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine the Ingredients</h3>

<p>In the large mixing bowl with the crumbled cornbread and toasted bread cubes, add the sautéed vegetable mixture. Pour in the beaten eggs and gluten-free broth. Gently mix everything together until well combined. The mixture should be moist but not overly soggy.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Bake the Dressing</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Transfer the dressing mixture to a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread it evenly and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the dressing is set. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cornbread Dressing</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use High-Quality Gluten-Free Ingredients:</strong> Ensure that all your ingredients, including the cornbread mix and broth, are certified gluten-free to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust the Moisture:</strong> If the dressing mixture seems too dry, add a bit more broth. If it's too wet, let it sit for a few minutes to absorb the liquid before baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Customize the Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add other herbs like rosemary or parsley, or even some diced apples or dried cranberries for a sweet twist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the dressing mixture up to a day in advance. Store it covered in the refrigerator and bake it just before serving. You may need to add a few extra minutes to the baking time if the mixture is cold.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free cornbread dressing?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Once baked and cooled, the dressing can be frozen in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and reheat in the oven before serving.</p>

    <h3>What can I serve with gluten-free cornbread dressing?</h3>
    <p>This dressing pairs beautifully with roasted turkey, ham, or even a vegetarian main dish like stuffed acorn squash. It's also delicious alongside other holiday favorites like mashed potatoes and green bean casserole.</p>
