    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Noodles</h3>
    <p>Start by cooking the gluten-free chow mein noodles according to the package instructions. Be sure not to overcook them, as they can become mushy. Once cooked, drain and rinse them under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Aromatics</h3>
    <p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic and ginger, and sauté for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Be careful not to burn them, as this can result in a bitter taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Add the sliced bell peppers, julienned carrots, and broccoli florets to the skillet. Stir-fry the vegetables for about 5-7 minutes until they are tender but still crisp. You want to retain some crunch in the vegetables for texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Noodles and Sauce</h3>
    <p>Add the cooked gluten-free noodles to the skillet with the vegetables. Pour in the gluten-free soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil. Toss everything together until the noodles and vegetables are well-coated with the sauce. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Finally, garnish the chow mein with chopped green onions. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot and enjoy your gluten-free chow mein!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Chow Mein</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Noodles:</strong> Not all gluten-free noodles are created equal. Look for noodles specifically labeled as "chow mein" or "stir-fry" noodles to ensure the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Vegetables:</strong> Fresh vegetables will give your chow mein a vibrant color and crisp texture. Avoid using frozen vegetables, as they can become soggy when cooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the Sauce:</strong> Feel free to adjust the amount of soy sauce and oyster sauce to suit your taste. You can also add a splash of rice vinegar or chili sauce for extra flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook in Batches:</strong> If you’re making a large quantity, cook the noodles and vegetables in batches to avoid overcrowding the skillet, which can lead to uneven cooking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chow Mein</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use any type of gluten-free noodles for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>While you can use any gluten-free noodles, it’s best to choose ones that are specifically designed for stir-frying or chow mein. These noodles hold up better during cooking and provide a more authentic texture.</p>

        <h3>2. Is oyster sauce gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Traditional oyster sauce contains gluten, but there are gluten-free versions available. Be sure to check the label to ensure that the oyster sauce you’re using is gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I add protein to this dish?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can add cooked chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu to make the dish more substantial. Simply cook the protein separately and add it to the skillet when combining the noodles and vegetables.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in a skillet or microwave until heated through.</p>
