<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Meatball Mixture</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, gluten-free breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, egg, minced garlic, chopped parsley, salt, and black pepper. Use your hands to mix the ingredients thoroughly, ensuring that everything is evenly distributed. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough meatballs.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Form the Meatballs</h3>
<p>Once the mixture is well combined, use your hands to form it into meatballs. Aim for meatballs that are about 1.5 inches in diameter. This should yield approximately 20 meatballs, depending on the size you prefer.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Brown the Meatballs</h3>
<p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the meatballs in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Brown the meatballs on all sides, which should take about 2-3 minutes per side. This step is optional but recommended, as it helps to seal in the juices and adds a nice texture to the meatballs.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Transfer to the Slow Cooker</h3>
<p>Once the meatballs are browned, transfer them to the slow cooker. Pour the gluten-free marinara sauce over the meatballs, ensuring that they are fully covered. If you prefer a saucier dish, you can add an extra cup of sauce.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Cook on Low Heat</h3>
<p>Set your slow cooker to low heat and cook the meatballs for 6-8 hours. If you're short on time, you can cook them on high heat for 3-4 hours. The longer cooking time on low heat will result in more tender and flavorful meatballs.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once the meatballs are cooked, serve them with your favorite gluten-free pasta, zucchini noodles, or even on their own as an appetizer. Garnish with additional Parmesan cheese and fresh parsley if desired.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Meatballs</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh garlic and parsley will give your meatballs a more vibrant flavor compared to dried alternatives.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the meatball mixture can result in dense, tough meatballs. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Check Your Sauce:</strong> Always double-check that your marinara sauce is gluten-free, as some brands may contain hidden gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Binders:</strong> If you don't have gluten-free breadcrumbs, you can use almond flour or crushed gluten-free crackers as a substitute.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free meatballs?</h3>
    <p>Yes, gluten-free meatballs freeze very well. Allow them to cool completely, then place them in an airtight container or freezer bag. They can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply thaw them in the refrigerator overnight and warm them in the microwave or on the stovetop.</p>

    <h3>Can I use turkey or chicken instead of beef?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Ground turkey or chicken can be used as a leaner alternative to beef. Just keep in mind that these meats have less fat, so the meatballs may be slightly drier. You can add a bit more olive oil or sauce to compensate.</p>

    <h3>What can I serve with gluten-free meatballs?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free meatballs are incredibly versatile. They can be served with gluten-free pasta, rice, or even mashed potatoes. For a low-carb option, try serving them with zucchini noodles or cauliflower rice.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these meatballs dairy-free as well?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make dairy-free meatballs by omitting the Parmesan cheese or using a dairy-free alternative. The meatballs will still be flavorful and tender.</p>
</div>

With just a few simple ingredients and minimal prep time, you can enjoy tender, flavorful meatballs that are perfect for any meal.
