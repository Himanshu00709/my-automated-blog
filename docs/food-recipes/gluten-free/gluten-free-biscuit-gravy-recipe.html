<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Roux</h3>
<p>In a medium-sized skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Once the butter is melted, add the gluten-free flour blend and whisk continuously to create a roux. Cook the roux for 1-2 minutes until it turns a light golden color. This step is crucial as it helps to thicken the gravy and gives it a rich, nutty flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Add the Milk</h3>
<p>Slowly pour in the milk while whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Continue to whisk until the mixture begins to thicken. This should take about 3-5 minutes. If you’re using dairy-free milk, make sure it’s unsweetened and unflavored to avoid altering the taste of the gravy.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Season the Gravy</h3>
<p>Add the salt and black pepper to the gravy, adjusting the seasoning to your taste. If you’re using sausage or bacon, stir it in at this point. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the gravy reaches your desired consistency. If the gravy is too thick, you can add a little more milk to thin it out.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Pour the gluten-free biscuit gravy over freshly baked gluten-free biscuits or your favorite side dish. Garnish with a sprinkle of fresh herbs like parsley or chives for an extra touch of flavor.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Biscuit Gravy</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that’s specifically designed for thickening, such as those containing rice flour or tapioca starch.</li>
    <li><strong>Whisk Constantly:</strong> To avoid lumps, make sure to whisk continuously while adding the milk to the roux.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust Consistency:</strong> If the gravy is too thick, add more milk a little at a time. If it’s too thin, let it simmer for a few more minutes to thicken.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add garlic powder, onion powder, or smoked paprika for a unique twist on the classic recipe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Biscuit Gravy</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
    <p>Almond flour is not recommended for making gravy as it doesn’t thicken well and can result in a gritty texture. Stick to a gluten-free flour blend designed for thickening.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this gravy ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make the gravy ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat it on the stovetop, adding a little milk if needed to restore the consistency.</p>

    <h3>Is this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>This recipe can be made dairy-free by using plant-based butter and non-dairy milk, such as almond, oat, or soy milk.</p>

    <h3>What can I serve with gluten-free biscuit gravy?</h3>
