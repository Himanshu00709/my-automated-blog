    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line your baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats to prevent the cookies from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugars</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until the mixture is light and fluffy. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Make sure the eggs are fully incorporated into the mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to tough cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in Chocolate Chips</h3>
    <p>Stir in the gluten-free chocolate chips and, if desired, the chopped nuts. Ensure that the chocolate chips are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may look slightly underbaked, but they will firm up as the cookies cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free Toll House cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of flours and starches, such as rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch, for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If your dough is too soft, chilling it for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Gluten-Free Certification:</strong> Ensure that all ingredients, including chocolate chips and vanilla extract, are certified gluten-free to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. Almond flour or coconut flour can be used, but they will alter the taste and consistency of the cookies.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter. Just make sure the substitute is suitable for baking.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the dough or baked cookies for longer storage.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other mix-ins?</h3>
        <p>Yes, feel free to customize your cookies with other mix-ins like dried fruit, white chocolate chips, or even gluten-free pretzels for a sweet and salty twist.</p>
