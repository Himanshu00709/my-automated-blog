    <h1>Gluten-Free Shortcake Recipes: A Delicious Guide</h1>
    <p>Shortcake is a classic dessert that has been enjoyed for generations. Traditionally made with wheat flour, it can be a challenge for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease to enjoy. However, with the rise of gluten-free baking, it's now easier than ever to create delicious, gluten-free shortcakes that everyone can enjoy. In this guide, we'll explore the basics of gluten-free baking, share some mouthwatering recipes, and answer common questions about gluten-free shortcakes.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Baking</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking requires a different approach than traditional baking. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, provides structure and elasticity to baked goods. When you remove gluten, you need to find alternative ingredients that can mimic these properties. Common gluten-free flours include almond flour, coconut flour, rice flour, and tapioca flour. These flours often need to be combined with binders like xanthan gum or psyllium husk to achieve the desired texture.</p>

    <h2>Essential Ingredients for Gluten-Free Shortcakes</h2>
    <p>To make the perfect gluten-free shortcake, you'll need a few key ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> A mix of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch works well.</li>
        <li><strong>Xanthan Gum:</strong> This helps bind the ingredients together, providing structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking Powder:</strong> Essential for leavening and creating a light, fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter or Coconut Oil:</strong> Adds richness and moisture to the shortcake.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Helps bind the ingredients and adds moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk or Dairy-Free Alternative:</strong> Adds moisture and helps create a tender crumb.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Classic Gluten-Free Shortcake Recipe</h2>
