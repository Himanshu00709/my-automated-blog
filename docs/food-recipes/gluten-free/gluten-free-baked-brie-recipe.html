    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). This ensures that your baked brie will cook evenly and achieve that perfect golden crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Brie</h3>
    <p>Unwrap the brie cheese wheel and place it in the center of your gluten-free puff pastry sheet. If you like, you can score the top of the brie with a knife to allow the flavors to seep in.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Toppings</h3>
    <p>Drizzle the honey over the brie, then sprinkle with fresh thyme and chopped nuts if desired. These toppings add a delightful sweetness and crunch to the dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Wrap the Brie</h3>
    <p>Carefully wrap the puff pastry around the brie, ensuring that it is fully covered. Trim any excess pastry and use it to decorate the top if you like. Seal the edges by pressing them together.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Apply Egg Wash</h3>
    <p>Beat the egg in a small bowl and brush it over the wrapped brie. This will give your baked brie a beautiful golden color when it comes out of the oven.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the wrapped brie on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the cheese is soft and gooey.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Remove the baked brie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Pair it with gluten-free crackers, fresh fruit, or even a simple salad for a complete appetizer.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Baked Brie</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose Quality Ingredients:</strong> Since this recipe has few ingredients, it's important to use high-quality brie and gluten-free puff pastry for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overbake:</strong> Keep an eye on the brie as it bakes. Overbaking can cause the cheese to become too runny and the pastry to burn.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> Feel free to get creative with your toppings. Try adding dried fruits, different herbs, or even a drizzle of balsamic glaze for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>
