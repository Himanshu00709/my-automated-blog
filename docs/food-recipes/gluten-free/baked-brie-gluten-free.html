    <h1>Baked Brie Gluten-Free: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>Baked brie is a classic appetizer that has been enjoyed for generations. Its creamy, gooey texture paired with a crispy crust makes it a crowd-pleaser at any gathering. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, traditional baked brie recipes can be off-limits due to the use of gluten-containing ingredients. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can enjoy a delicious gluten-free baked brie that is just as indulgent and satisfying as the original.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Baked Brie?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals looking to improve their overall health. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and inflammation in some people. By opting for a gluten-free baked brie, you can enjoy this luxurious dish without compromising your dietary needs or health goals.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Baked Brie</h2>
    <p>Creating a gluten-free baked brie is easier than you might think. The key is to use gluten-free alternatives for the crust and any additional toppings. Here’s a list of ingredients you’ll need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 wheel of brie cheese (about 8 ounces)</li>
        <li>1 sheet of gluten-free puff pastry or phyllo dough</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of honey or maple syrup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of chopped nuts (such as almonds or pecans)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of dried fruit (such as cranberries or apricots)</li>
        <li>1 egg (for egg wash)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free baked brie:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Set your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the brie:</strong> If desired, you can remove the rind from the brie, but it’s not necessary. The rind is edible and adds a nice texture to the dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Wrap the brie:</strong> Roll out your gluten-free puff pastry or phyllo dough and place the brie in the center. Fold the dough over the brie, sealing the edges tightly. You can use a little water to help seal the dough if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Add toppings:</strong> Drizzle the honey or maple syrup over the top of the wrapped brie, then sprinkle with chopped nuts and dried fruit.</li>
        <li><strong>Brush with egg wash:</strong> Beat the egg and brush it over the top of the pastry. This will give your baked brie a beautiful golden color.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the brie on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the cheese is melted.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Allow the baked brie to cool for a few minutes before serving. It pairs wonderfully with gluten-free crackers, sliced apples, or fresh bread.</li>
    </ol>
