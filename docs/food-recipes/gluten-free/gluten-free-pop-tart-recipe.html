    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by combining the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, salt, and granulated sugar in a large mixing bowl. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

    <p>Gradually add cold water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Once the dough is formed, divide it into two equal portions, shape them into discs, wrap them in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Roll Out the Dough</h3>

    <p>After the dough has chilled, remove one disc from the refrigerator and roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Roll the dough to about 1/8-inch thickness. Use a knife or a pastry cutter to cut the dough into rectangles, approximately 3x4 inches in size.</p>

    <h3>3. Add the Filling</h3>

    <p>Place a small spoonful of fruit preserves or jam in the center of half of the rectangles, leaving a small border around the edges. Brush the edges with a little water to help seal the Pop Tarts. Place the remaining rectangles on top of the filled ones and press the edges together with a fork to seal.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Pop Tarts</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer the assembled Pop Tarts to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Allow the Pop Tarts to cool completely on a wire rack before adding the glaze.</p>

    <h3>5. Prepare the Glaze</h3>

    <p>In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk (or non-dairy alternative), and vanilla extract until smooth. Adjust the consistency by adding more milk if needed. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled Pop Tarts and let it set before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. A blend that includes rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch typically works well for pastries.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these Pop Tarts ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the dough and assemble the Pop Tarts ahead of time. Store them in the refrigerator for up to 2 days before baking, or freeze them for longer storage. Just bake them straight from the fridge or freezer, adding a few extra minutes to the baking time if necessary.</p>

        <h3>What other fillings can I use?</h3>
        <p>The possibilities are endless! You can use chocolate spread, peanut butter, or even a savory filling like cheese and herbs. Get creative and try different combinations to find your favorite.</p>
