    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free chicken casserole in the slow cooker:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong> Place the chicken breasts at the bottom of the slow cooker. Season them with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Sauce:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free cream of chicken soup, gluten-free chicken broth, and gluten-free all-purpose flour until smooth. Pour this mixture over the chicken in the slow cooker.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Vegetables:</strong> Spread the frozen mixed vegetables evenly over the chicken and sauce mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook:</strong> Cover the slow cooker and cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high for 3-4 hours, until the chicken is cooked through and tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> In the last 30 minutes of cooking, sprinkle the gluten-free breadcrumbs and shredded cheddar cheese over the top of the casserole. Cover and continue cooking until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Chicken Casserole</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free chicken casserole turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Ingredients:</strong> Since gluten-free cooking relies heavily on the quality of ingredients, make sure to use high-quality gluten-free products, especially the cream of chicken soup and breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook:</strong> Slow cookers are designed to cook food gently, but it’s still possible to overcook chicken. Check the chicken after 6 hours on low or 3 hours on high to ensure it’s tender but not dry.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize Your Vegetables:</strong> Feel free to swap out the frozen mixed vegetables for your favorite fresh or frozen veggies. Broccoli, carrots, and peas are all great options.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Some Heat:</strong> If you like a bit of spice, consider adding a pinch of cayenne pepper or a dash of hot sauce to the sauce mixture.</li>
    </ul>
