    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Potatoes</h3>

    <p>Start by peeling the russet potatoes and cutting them into small chunks. Place the potato chunks in a pot of salted water and bring to a boil. Cook until the potatoes are tender but not mushy, about 10-12 minutes. Drain the potatoes and let them cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mash and Season</h3>

    <p>Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, mash them in a large bowl until they are mostly smooth but still have some texture. Add the gluten-free flour, cornstarch, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix everything together until well combined. If you like a bit of spice, you can also add a pinch of paprika or chili powder at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Tater Tots</h3>

    <p>Take small portions of the potato mixture and shape them into small cylinders, about 1 inch long and 1/2 inch in diameter. You can use your hands or a small cookie scoop to make this process easier. Place the shaped tater tots on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake or Fry</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 400째F (200째C). Brush the tater tots lightly with olive oil and bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping them halfway through, until they are golden brown and crispy. Alternatively, you can fry the tater tots in hot oil for 2-3 minutes until they are crispy and golden. Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once the tater tots are cooked, serve them hot with your favorite dipping sauce. Ketchup, ranch dressing, or a spicy aioli all pair wonderfully with these gluten-free tater tots. Enjoy them as a snack, side dish, or even as part of a main meal!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Tater Tots</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use the Right Potatoes:</strong> Russet potatoes are the best choice for tater tots because of their high starch content, which helps them hold together and become crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Over-Mash:</strong> Be careful not to over-mash the potatoes. You want them to have some texture to mimic the classic tater tot consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill Before Baking:</strong> If you have time, chill the shaped tater tots in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before baking or frying. This helps them hold their shape better.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Seasonings:</strong> Feel free to experiment with different seasonings to suit your taste. Smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, or even a bit of grated cheese can add extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these tater tots ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the tater tots up to the shaping stage and then store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before baking or frying. You can also freeze the shaped tater tots for up to 3 months. Just bake or fry them directly from frozen, adding a few extra minutes to the cooking time.</p>

        <h3>Can I use sweet potatoes instead of russet potatoes?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Sweet potatoes can be used as a substitute for russet potatoes. Keep in mind that sweet potatoes have a different texture and flavor, so the final result will be slightly different. You may need to adjust the seasoning to complement the sweetness of the potatoes.</p>

        <h3>Are these tater tots vegan?</h3>
        <p>This recipe is naturally vegan as long as you use a vegan-friendly gluten-free flour. Be sure to check the labels on your ingredients to ensure they meet your dietary requirements.</p>

        <h3>Can I air fry these tater tots?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can air fry these tater tots for a healthier alternative to frying. Preheat your air fryer to 400째F (200째C) and cook the tater tots for 10-12 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through, until they are crispy and golden brown.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

With just a few simple ingredients and some basic kitchen tools, you can create a delicious, crispy snack that everyone will love. Whether you're following a gluten-free diet or just looking for a healthier alternative to store-bought tater tots, this recipe is sure to become a favorite. So why not give it a try?
