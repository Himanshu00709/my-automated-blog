    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions for making this delicious gluten-free cornbread:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you're ready to bake the cornbread, which is crucial for achieving the perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare Your Baking Dish</h3>
    <p>Grease an 8-inch square baking dish or a 9-inch round cake pan with butter or a non-stick cooking spray. This will prevent the cornbread from sticking to the pan and make it easier to remove once it's baked.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the Red Mill Gluten-Free Cornmeal, gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Whisk these ingredients together until they are well combined. This ensures that the leavening agents are evenly distributed, which is essential for a uniform rise.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and melted butter. Make sure the butter has cooled slightly before adding it to the mixture to avoid cooking the eggs. Once combined, pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Mix the Batter</h3>
    <p>Gently stir the wet and dry ingredients together until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense and tough cornbread. The batter should be thick but pourable.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Cornbread</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and spread it evenly with a spatula. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the cornbread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm with butter, honey, or your favorite toppings.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cornbread</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different brand of gluten-free cornmeal?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any brand of gluten-free cornmeal, but Red Mill's cornmeal is highly recommended for its quality and consistency. If you choose a different brand, make sure it's labeled gluten-free to avoid cross-contamination.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the milk with a dairy-free alternative like almond milk, soy milk, or oat milk. Similarly, you can use a dairy-free butter substitute or coconut oil in place of regular butter.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftover cornbread?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover cornbread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and refrigerate for up to a week. You can also freeze the cornbread for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other ingredients to the cornbread?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize this recipe by adding ingredients like shredded cheese, jalapeños, or corn kernels. Just be sure to adjust the baking time if you add extra moisture-heavy ingredients.</p>
