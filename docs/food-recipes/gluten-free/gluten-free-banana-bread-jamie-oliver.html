    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create Jamie Oliver’s gluten-free banana bread:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 180°C (350°F). Grease a loaf tin and line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash the bananas:</strong> In a large bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more flavorful your bread will be.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugar:</strong> In another bowl, cream the butter (or coconut oil) and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Fold in the mashed bananas and any optional add-ins like walnuts or chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf tin and smooth the top. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the banana bread to cool in the tin for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Banana Bread</h2>
    <p>Here are some expert tips to ensure your gluten-free banana bread turns out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use ripe bananas:</strong> The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more flavorful your bread will be. Overripe bananas with brown spots are ideal.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense loaf. Mix until just combined to keep the bread light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking your bread at the 50-minute mark. If the top is browning too quickly, cover it with foil.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with add-ins:</strong> Feel free to customize your banana bread with nuts, seeds, or chocolate chips for added texture and flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend you prefer. However, the combination of gluten-free flour and almond flour in Jamie Oliver’s recipe provides the best texture and flavor.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and use coconut oil instead of butter.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the banana bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the banana bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly and freeze for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other fruits to the recipe?</h3>
        <p>While bananas are the star of this recipe, you can add other fruits like blueberries or diced apples for a twist. Just be mindful of the moisture content.</p>
