    <h1>Gluten-Free Flapjack Recipe: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>Flapjacks are a classic British treat, loved for their chewy texture and sweet, oaty goodness. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, traditional flapjacks can be off-limits due to the presence of oats that may contain gluten. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can enjoy a gluten-free version of this beloved snack. In this article, we’ll explore a detailed gluten-free flapjack recipe, along with tips, variations, and answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Flapjacks?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free flapjacks are not just for those with gluten sensitivities. They are a healthier alternative for anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake or explore new dietary options. Gluten-free oats are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, making them a nutritious choice for a snack or breakfast option. Plus, they are incredibly easy to make and can be customized with various add-ins like nuts, seeds, or dried fruits.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Flapjacks</h2>
    <p>To make gluten-free flapjacks, you’ll need the following ingredients:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Ingredient</th>
            <th>Quantity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Gluten-free rolled oats</td>
            <td>250g</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Unsalted butter (or dairy-free alternative)</td>
            <td>125g</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Golden syrup</td>
            <td>100g</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Light brown sugar</td>
            <td>100g</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Optional add-ins (e.g., dried fruits, nuts, seeds)</td>
            <td>50-100g</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 160°C (320°F) and line a baking tin with parchment paper. A 20cm x 20cm tin works well for this recipe.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Melt the Butter, Syrup, and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized saucepan, melt the butter, golden syrup, and light brown sugar over low heat. Stir continuously until the mixture is smooth and well combined. Be careful not to let it boil.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine with Oats</h3>
    <p>Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the gluten-free rolled oats. If you’re using any optional add-ins like dried fruits or nuts, add them at this stage. Mix thoroughly to ensure the oats are evenly coated with the syrup mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Press into the Tin</h3>
    <p>Transfer the mixture into the prepared baking tin and press it down firmly with the back of a spoon or a spatula. Ensure the mixture is evenly spread and compacted to prevent the flapjacks from crumbling later.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the tin in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The center should still be slightly soft as the flapjacks will firm up as they cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Cut</h3>
    <p>Allow the flapjacks to cool completely in the tin before cutting them into squares or rectangles. This step is crucial to ensure they hold their shape.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Flapjacks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use certified gluten-free oats:</strong> Regular oats can be contaminated with gluten during processing, so always opt for certified gluten-free oats.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overbake:</strong> Overbaking can result in dry and crumbly flapjacks. Keep an eye on them during the last few minutes of baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with add-ins:</strong> Customize your flapjacks by adding ingredients like chocolate chips, coconut flakes, or chia seeds for extra flavor and texture.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Are gluten-free flapjacks suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can be made vegan by using a dairy-free butter alternative. Ensure that all other ingredients, including the golden syrup, are vegan-friendly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store gluten-free flapjacks?</h3>

With this simple recipe, you can create a batch of chewy, sweet, and nutritious flapjacks that are perfect for snacking or as a quick breakfast option.
