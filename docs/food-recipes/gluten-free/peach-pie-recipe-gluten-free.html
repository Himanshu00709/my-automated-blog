    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Pie Crust</h3>

    <p>Start by making the gluten-free pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour and xanthan gum (if needed). Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

    <p>Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Divide the dough into two equal portions, shape them into discs, wrap them in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Peach Filling</h3>

    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the peach filling. In a large bowl, combine the sliced peaches, granulated sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, ground cinnamon, and salt. Gently toss the peaches until they are evenly coated with the mixture. Set aside to allow the flavors to meld.</p>

    <h3>3. Roll Out the Dough</h3>

    <p>After the dough has chilled, remove one disc from the refrigerator and roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Roll the dough into a circle large enough to fit your pie dish. Carefully transfer the dough to the pie dish, pressing it gently into the bottom and sides.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Pie</h3>

    <p>Pour the peach filling into the prepared pie crust. Roll out the second disc of dough and place it over the filling. You can create a lattice pattern or simply cover the pie with the dough, cutting a few slits in the top to allow steam to escape. Seal the edges by crimping them with a fork or your fingers.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake the Pie</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the pie on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. If the edges of the crust start to brown too quickly, cover them with aluminum foil to prevent burning.</p>

    <h3>6. Cool and Serve</h3>

    <p>Once the pie is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours. This allows the filling to set and makes it easier to slice. Serve your gluten-free peach pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra special treat.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Peach Pie</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use frozen peaches instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen peaches if fresh ones are not available. However, make sure to thaw and drain them thoroughly before using to avoid excess moisture in the filling.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make the pie crust ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the pie crust dough up to 2 days in advance and store it in the refrigerator. Alternatively, you can freeze the dough for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>3. What can I use instead of xanthan gum?</h3>
        <p>If your gluten-free flour blend does not include xanthan gum, you can substitute it with guar gum or psyllium husk powder. These ingredients help bind the dough and give it a more traditional texture.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store leftover peach pie?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover pie in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze the pie for up to 2 months. To reheat, simply place the pie in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) until warmed through.</p>

With a flaky, buttery crust and a sweet, juicy peach filling, this pie is sure to become a favorite in your household. Whether you’re serving it at a summer barbecue, a holiday gathering, or just as a special treat for yourself, this gluten-free peach pie is a dessert that everyone can enjoy.
