    <h1>Spanish Rice Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Spanish rice, also known as Mexican rice, is a flavorful and versatile dish that has become a staple in many households. Traditionally made with white rice, tomatoes, onions, and a blend of spices, it’s a dish that’s both comforting and satisfying. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying traditional Spanish rice can be a challenge due to potential cross-contamination or hidden gluten in ingredients. In this guide, we’ll explore how to make delicious gluten-free Spanish rice, discuss its nutritional benefits, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Spanish Rice Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>At its core, Spanish rice is naturally gluten-free, as the primary ingredients—rice, tomatoes, and spices—do not contain gluten. However, the risk of gluten contamination often comes from processed ingredients like broth, seasoning mixes, or pre-packaged rice blends. To ensure your Spanish rice is gluten-free, it’s essential to use certified gluten-free ingredients and avoid cross-contamination during preparation.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Spanish Rice</h2>
    <p>Here’s a list of ingredients you’ll need to make gluten-free Spanish rice:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of long-grain white rice (certified gluten-free)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (14.5 oz) of diced tomatoes (check for gluten-free certification)</li>
        <li>4 cups of gluten-free chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of chili powder</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to prepare gluten-free Spanish rice:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Rinse the Rice:</strong> Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming sticky.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Aromatics:</strong> In a large skillet or pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until softened and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast the Rice:</strong> Add the rinsed rice to the skillet and toast it for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently. This step enhances the nutty flavor of the rice.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Tomatoes and Spices:</strong> Stir in the diced tomatoes, cumin, paprika, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 2 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer the Rice:</strong> Pour in the gluten-free broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li><strong>Fluff and Serve:</strong> Remove the skillet from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork, garnish with fresh cilantro if desired, and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
