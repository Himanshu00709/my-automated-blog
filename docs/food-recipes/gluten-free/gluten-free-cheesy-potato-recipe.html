    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get cooking! Follow these simple steps to create a mouthwatering gluten-free cheesy potato casserole:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure that your casserole bakes evenly and comes out perfectly golden and bubbly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Peel and thinly slice the potatoes. You can use a mandoline slicer for even slices, but a sharp knife will work just fine. Place the sliced potatoes in a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from browning while you prepare the cheese sauce.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Cheese Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in the gluten-free all-purpose flour to create a roux. Cook the roux for about 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until it becomes fragrant. Gradually whisk in the milk, ensuring there are no lumps. Continue to cook the sauce until it thickens, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in the shredded cheddar cheese, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Mix until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Drain the sliced potatoes and pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel. In a greased 9x13 inch baking dish, layer half of the potato slices. Pour half of the cheese sauce over the potatoes, spreading it evenly. Repeat with the remaining potatoes and cheese sauce. Make sure the top layer is well-covered with the sauce.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the casserole is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with freshly chopped chives if desired, and serve warm. This dish pairs beautifully with a fresh green salad or roasted vegetables for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While cheddar cheese is a classic choice, you can experiment with other types of cheese like mozzarella, gouda, or even a blend of cheeses for a unique flavor profile.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the casserole up to the point of baking, cover it tightly, and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours. When you're ready to bake, simply remove it from the fridge, let it come to room temperature, and bake as directed.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for freezing?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this gluten-free cheesy potato casserole freezes well. After baking, let it cool completely, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. To reheat, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and bake at 350°F (175°C) until heated through.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other ingredients to the casserole?</h3>
        <p>Certainly! Feel free to add cooked bacon, diced ham, or sautéed vegetables like spinach or mushrooms to the casserole for added flavor and texture.</p>
