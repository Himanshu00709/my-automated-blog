    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Start by slicing the chicken breasts horizontally to create thinner cutlets. This will help the chicken cook evenly and absorb the flavors of the sauce. Season both sides of the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Coat the Chicken with Almond Flour</h3>
    <p>Place the almond flour in a shallow dish. Dredge each chicken cutlet in the almond flour, ensuring an even coating on both sides. The almond flour will give the chicken a crispy texture while keeping it gluten-free.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken cutlets and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the chicken broth, lemon juice, and capers. Bring the mixture to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. This will add depth to the sauce. Stir in the butter until it melts and the sauce thickens slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine and Serve</h3>
    <p>Return the chicken to the skillet, spooning the sauce over the cutlets. Let the chicken simmer in the sauce for an additional 2-3 minutes to absorb the flavors. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve immediately.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can be made dairy-free by using a dairy-free butter alternative. Ensure that the chicken broth you use is also dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>While it’s best served fresh, you can prepare the chicken and sauce separately and store them in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop before serving.</p>

        <h3>What can I serve with gluten-free chicken piccata?</h3>
        <p>This dish pairs well with gluten-free pasta, steamed vegetables, or a fresh green salad. You can also serve it with roasted potatoes or quinoa for a complete meal.</p>
