<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Fold in the diced apples, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Preheat the Air Fryer</h3>

<p>Preheat your air fryer to 375°F (190°C). This step is crucial for achieving the perfect texture and ensuring that your fritters cook evenly.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Form the Fritters</h3>

<p>Using a spoon or a small ice cream scoop, drop portions of the batter onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. You can make them as large or as small as you like, but keep in mind that smaller fritters will cook faster. Gently flatten each portion to form a fritter shape.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Air Fry the Fritters</h3>

<p>Lightly brush the air fryer basket with coconut oil to prevent sticking. Place the fritters in the basket, leaving some space between each one to allow for air circulation. Air fry for 8-10 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the fritters are golden brown and cooked through.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Once the fritters are done, remove them from the air fryer and let them cool slightly. You can dust them with powdered sugar, drizzle them with a glaze, or enjoy them as is. Serve warm for the best flavor and texture.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Apple Fritters</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Fresh Apples:</strong> Fresh, crisp apples like Granny Smith or Honeycrisp work best for this recipe. They provide a nice contrast to the sweet batter.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense fritters. Mix until just combined to keep them light and fluffy.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust Cooking Time:</strong> Cooking times may vary depending on your air fryer model. Keep an eye on the fritters and adjust the time as needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> Get creative with your toppings! Try a cinnamon-sugar mixture, a drizzle of caramel, or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours like almond flour or oat flour. However, the texture may vary, so you may need to adjust the liquid ingredients accordingly.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these fritters ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>While they are best enjoyed fresh, you can store leftover fritters in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Reheat them in the air fryer for a few minutes to restore their crispiness.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free apple fritters?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the fritters for up to a month. Place them in a single layer on a baking sheet to freeze, then transfer them to a freezer-safe bag. Reheat in the air fryer when ready to eat.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a different sweetener?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute honey or maple syrup with other sweeteners like agave nectar or stevia. Adjust the quantity to suit your taste.</p>

<p>Gluten-free apple fritters made in the air fryer are a delicious and healthier alternative to the traditional deep-fried version.
