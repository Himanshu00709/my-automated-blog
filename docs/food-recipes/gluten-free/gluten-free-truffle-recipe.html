    <h2>Ingredients You'll Need</h2>
    <p>Before diving into the recipe, it's essential to gather all the necessary ingredients. Here's what you'll need:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>

                <th>Quantity</th>

                <td>200g</td>
                <td>Ensure it's at least 70% cocoa</td>
            </tr>

                <td>100ml</td>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chocolate Ganache</h3>
    <p>Start by finely chopping the gluten-free dark chocolate and placing it in a heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat until it just begins to simmer. Pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolate and let it sit for a minute to allow the chocolate to melt. Stir gently until the mixture is smooth and glossy. Add the softened butter and vanilla extract, stirring until fully incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Chill the Ganache</h3>
    <p>Once the ganache is ready, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until the mixture is firm enough to handle. This step is crucial for achieving the right consistency for rolling the truffles.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Truffles</h3>
    <p>After the ganache has chilled, use a small spoon or a melon baller to scoop out portions of the mixture. Roll each portion between your palms to form smooth, round balls. If the ganache becomes too soft to handle, return it to the refrigerator for a few minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Coat the Truffles</h3>
    <p>Place the gluten-free cocoa powder in a shallow dish. Roll each truffle in the cocoa powder until fully coated. You can also experiment with other coatings, such as crushed nuts, shredded coconut, or even a dusting of powdered sugar.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once coated, the truffles are ready to serve. Arrange them on a platter or store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to enjoy. These truffles make a perfect after-dinner treat or a thoughtful homemade gift.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Truffles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Chocolate:</strong> The quality of the chocolate you use will significantly impact the flavor of your truffles. Opt for a high-quality gluten-free dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa content.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill Thoroughly:</strong> Ensure the ganache is well-chilled before rolling to make the process easier and to achieve the perfect texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Coatings:</strong> While cocoa powder is a classic choice, don't be afraid to get creative with other gluten-free coatings like crushed nuts, coconut, or even a drizzle of melted chocolate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use milk chocolate if you prefer a sweeter truffle. However, keep in mind that milk chocolate has a lower cocoa content, which may affect the texture and firmness of the truffles. Adjust the chilling time accordingly.</p>

        <h3>How long do gluten-free truffles last?</h3>
        <p>When stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator, gluten-free truffles can last up to two weeks. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to three months. Just be sure to let them come to room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these truffles dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make dairy-free truffles, substitute the heavy cream with a dairy-free alternative like coconut cream and replace the butter with a dairy-free margarine. Ensure all other ingredients are also dairy-free.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Creating gluten-free truffles at home is a rewarding experience that allows you to enjoy a luxurious treat without compromising on dietary needs. With just a few simple ingredients and some patience, you can whip up a batch of these decadent delights that are sure to impress. Whether you're sharing them with friends or savoring them on your own, these gluten-free truffles are a testament to the fact that indulgence and dietary restrictions can indeed go hand in hand.</p>
