    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get cooking! Follow these steps to create a delicious gluten-free chicken and dumplings dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken and Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Start by cooking your chicken breast. You can boil, bake, or use a rotisserie chicken for convenience. Once cooked, shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces. In a large pot, sauté the diced onions, carrots, and celery in a bit of olive oil until they begin to soften. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Create the Broth Base</h3>
    <p>Add the shredded chicken to the pot with the vegetables. Pour in the gluten-free chicken broth and stir to combine. Season with salt, black pepper, thyme, and add the bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Dumplings</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free Bisquick mix with the milk. Stir until a soft dough forms. Drop spoonfuls of the dough into the simmering broth. The dumplings will expand as they cook, so be sure to leave some space between them.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Dumplings</h3>
    <p>Cover the pot and let the dumplings cook for about 10 minutes. Avoid stirring the pot during this time, as it can cause the dumplings to break apart. After 10 minutes, check the dumplings to ensure they are cooked through. They should be fluffy and firm to the touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the dumplings are cooked, remove the pot from the heat. Discard the bay leaf and ladle the chicken and dumplings into bowls. Serve hot and enjoy your gluten-free comfort food!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Chicken and Dumplings</h2>
    <p>Here are some additional tips to ensure your dish turns out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh vegetables and herbs will enhance the flavor of your dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dumpling Dough:</strong> Overmixing can make the dumplings tough. Stir just until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer Gently:</strong> A gentle simmer is key to cooking the dumplings evenly without breaking them apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Seasonings:</strong> Taste the broth before adding the dumplings and adjust the seasonings as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour mix?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use another gluten-free flour mix, but the texture and flavor may vary slightly. Bisquick is specifically formulated to mimic the texture of traditional dumplings, so it’s recommended for best results.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the milk in the dumpling dough with a dairy-free alternative like almond milk or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave, adding a bit of broth if needed to loosen the mixture.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this dish?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze gluten-free chicken and dumplings. However, the texture of the dumplings may change slightly upon reheating. It’s best to freeze the broth and dumplings separately if possible.</p>
