    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free potato casserole:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure that your casserole bakes evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the potatoes:</strong> Peel and thinly slice the potatoes. You can use a mandoline slicer for even slices, which will help the casserole cook uniformly.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the gluten-free flour and whisk until smooth. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Cook until the sauce thickens, then remove from heat and stir in half of the shredded cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer the casserole:</strong> In a greased baking dish, layer the sliced potatoes. Pour the cheese sauce over the potatoes, ensuring they are evenly coated. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Add optional toppings:</strong> If you’re using gluten-free breadcrumbs, bacon bits, or chives, sprinkle them over the top of the casserole for added texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the potatoes are tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Let the casserole cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy your gluten-free potato casserole as a main dish or a side!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Variations and Tips</h2>
    <p>One of the best things about a gluten-free potato casserole is its versatility. Here are a few variations and tips to customize your dish:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Add vegetables:</strong> Incorporate vegetables like broccoli, spinach, or bell peppers for added nutrition and color.</li>
        <li><strong>Use different cheeses:</strong> Experiment with different types of gluten-free cheeses, such as mozzarella, gouda, or feta, to change the flavor profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Make it vegan:</strong> Substitute the butter and milk with plant-based alternatives, and use a vegan cheese to make the casserole dairy-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Spice it up:</strong> Add a pinch of paprika, garlic powder, or cayenne pepper to the sauce for a bit of heat.</li>
    </ul>
