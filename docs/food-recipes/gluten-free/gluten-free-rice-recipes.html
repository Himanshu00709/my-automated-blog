    <h1>Gluten-Free Rice Recipes: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Rice is a staple food for billions of people around the world, and for good reason. It’s versatile, affordable, and naturally gluten-free, making it an excellent choice for those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake. In this blog post, we’ll explore a variety of gluten-free rice recipes that are not only delicious but also easy to prepare. Whether you’re a seasoned chef or a beginner in the kitchen, these recipes will inspire you to make rice a star ingredient in your meals.</p>

    <p>Rice is inherently gluten-free, which means it’s safe for individuals who need to avoid gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Rice, on the other hand, is a safe and nutritious alternative. It’s rich in carbohydrates, provides energy, and can be paired with a variety of ingredients to create balanced meals. Additionally, rice is a blank canvas, allowing you to experiment with flavors, textures, and cuisines from around the world.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sushi rice</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Nori sheets</li>
        <li>Fillings of your choice (cucumber, avocado, cooked shrimp, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
