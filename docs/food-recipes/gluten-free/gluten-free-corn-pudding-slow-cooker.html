<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Slow Cooker</h3>

<p>Start by greasing the inside of your slow cooker with a little butter or cooking spray. This will prevent the pudding from sticking and make cleanup easier.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix the Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free cornbread mix, drained corn kernels, creamed corn, eggs, milk, melted butter, sugar, salt, and black pepper. Stir until all the ingredients are well combined and the mixture is smooth.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cook in the Slow Cooker</h3>

<p>Pour the mixture into the prepared slow cooker. Cover with the lid and cook on low heat for 4-5 hours or on high heat for 2-3 hours. The pudding is done when it is set in the center and the edges are golden brown.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Once the pudding is cooked, let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Scoop out portions and enjoy this creamy, gluten-free delight as a side dish or even as a dessert!</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Corn Pudding</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh corn kernels can be used instead of canned for a more vibrant flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a sweeter pudding, increase the sugar to 1/2 cup. For a savory version, reduce the sugar to 1 tablespoon.</li>
    <li><strong>Add-ins:</strong> Consider adding shredded cheese, diced jalape√±os, or cooked bacon for extra flavor and texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Leftover corn pudding can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave or oven before serving.</li>
</ul>
