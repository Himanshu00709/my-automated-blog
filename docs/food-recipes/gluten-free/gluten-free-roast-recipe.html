    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This will ensure that your roast cooks evenly and retains its moisture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Roast</h3>
    <p>Pat the roast dry with paper towels. This helps the seasoning stick to the meat. In a small bowl, mix the olive oil, minced garlic, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper. Rub this mixture all over the roast, ensuring it’s evenly coated.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Sear the Roast</h3>
    <p>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and sear the roast on all sides until it’s browned. This step locks in the flavors and creates a delicious crust on the outside of the roast.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Prepare the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>While the roast is searing, prepare your vegetables. Slice the carrots, quarter the potatoes, and slice the onions. These will be added to the roasting pan later.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Assemble the Roast</h3>
    <p>Place the seared roast in a large roasting pan. Surround it with the prepared vegetables. Pour the gluten-free soy sauce or tamari and broth over the roast and vegetables. This will add moisture and flavor to the dish as it cooks.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Roast in the Oven</h3>
    <p>Cover the roasting pan with aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Roast for about 2-2.5 hours, or until the internal temperature of the roast reaches 145°F (63°C) for medium-rare or 160°F (71°C) for medium. Baste the roast with the pan juices every 30 minutes to keep it moist.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Rest and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the roast is cooked to your desired doneness, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 15-20 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, ensuring a tender and flavorful roast. Slice the roast and serve it with the roasted vegetables and pan juices.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use chicken, lamb, or even a plant-based roast if you prefer. Just adjust the cooking time accordingly to ensure the meat is cooked through.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free soy sauce?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free soy sauce or tamari, you can use coconut aminos as a substitute. It has a similar flavor profile and is also gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>How do I know if the roast is cooked properly?</h3>
        <p>The best way to ensure your roast is cooked to the right temperature is by using a meat thermometer. Insert it into the thickest part of the roast, avoiding any bones, and check the internal temperature.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the roast and vegetables ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator. When you’re ready to cook, simply follow the roasting instructions. You may need to add a few extra minutes to the cooking time if the roast is cold from the fridge.</p>
