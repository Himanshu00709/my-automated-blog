<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these dry ingredients together until well combined. In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing until fully incorporated. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough begins to form. If the dough is too dry, add milk one tablespoon at a time until the dough comes together.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Roll Out the Dough</h3>

<p>Once the dough is ready, divide it into two equal portions. Place one portion between two sheets of parchment paper and roll it out to about ¼ inch thickness. Using animal-shaped cookie cutters, cut out shapes from the dough and carefully transfer them to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat this process with the second portion of dough.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Bake the Crackers</h3>

<p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the crackers for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Keep an eye on them, as baking times may vary depending on your oven. Once baked, remove the crackers from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Enjoy!</h3>

<p>Once the crackers have cooled, they’re ready to enjoy! Store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. These gluten-free animal crackers are perfect for snacking, packing in lunchboxes, or serving at parties. They’re also a great option for those following a gluten-free diet, as they’re free from gluten and made with wholesome ingredients.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Animal Crackers</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. Almond flour is used in this recipe to add a nutty flavor and help with the texture, but you can substitute it with another gluten-free flour if needed.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I make these crackers dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a dairy-free milk substitute like almond milk or oat milk.</p>

    <h3>3. How long do these crackers stay fresh?</h3>
    <p>When stored in an airtight container at room temperature, these gluten-free animal crackers will stay fresh for up to a week. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to three months.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I add flavors or spices to the dough?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can customize the flavor of your crackers by adding spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, or even a pinch of cocoa powder. Just be mindful of the quantities to avoid overpowering the dough.</p>
