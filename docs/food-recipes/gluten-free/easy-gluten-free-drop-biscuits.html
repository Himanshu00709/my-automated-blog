    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free drop biscuits is straightforward, but following these steps carefully will ensure the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 425°F (220°C). This ensures the biscuits bake evenly and rise properly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. This ensures even distribution of leavening agents.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut in the Butter:</strong> Add cold, cubed butter to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Milk:</strong> Gradually pour in the milk, stirring until the dough just comes together. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to tough biscuits.</li>
        <li><strong>Drop the Dough:</strong> Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop mounds of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Space them about 2 inches apart to allow for spreading.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown on top. Let them cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Drop Biscuits</h2>

    <p>Here are some expert tips to help you achieve the best results:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Ingredients:</strong> Cold butter and milk help create flaky layers in the biscuits. Avoid using room-temperature ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to dense biscuits. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Add cheese, herbs, or even a touch of honey to customize the flavor of your biscuits.</li>
        <li><strong>Let Them Rest:</strong> Allow the biscuits to cool for a few minutes before serving. This helps them set and makes them easier to handle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Drop Biscuits</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour can be used, but it will result in a denser texture. For lighter biscuits, stick to a gluten-free flour blend that includes xanthan gum.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these biscuits ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes! You can prepare the dough and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours before baking. Alternatively, bake the biscuits and store them in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Are these biscuits suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the butter with a plant-based alternative and use non-dairy milk to make these biscuits vegan-friendly.</p>
