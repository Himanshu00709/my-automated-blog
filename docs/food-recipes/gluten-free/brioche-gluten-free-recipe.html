            <tr>

                <td>1/4 cup</td>
                <td>Granulated or cane sugar.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Active dry yeast</td>
                <td>2 1/4 teaspoons</td>
                <td>Ensure it’s gluten-free.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>1/2 teaspoon</td>
                <td>Fine sea salt or kosher salt.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Activate the Yeast</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine the warm milk and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the mixture and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes, or until it becomes frothy. This step ensures that the yeast is active and ready to help the dough rise.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and salt. Add the softened butter and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the yeast mixture and eggs, mixing until a soft dough forms. The dough will be sticky, but that’s normal for gluten-free brioche.</p>

    <h3>3. Let the Dough Rise</h3>
    <p>Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size. Gluten-free dough may not rise as much as traditional dough, but it should still increase in volume.</p>

    <h3>4. Shape the Brioche</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, gently punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough into equal portions and shape them into brioche rolls or place them in a loaf pan for a traditional brioche loaf. Cover the shaped dough and let it rise again for about 30-45 minutes.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake the Brioche</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Brush the tops of the brioche with an egg wash (1 beaten egg mixed with 1 tablespoon of water) for a shiny, golden crust. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the brioche is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.</p>

    <h3>6. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the brioche to cool on a wire rack before serving. Enjoy it fresh out of the oven with a pat of butter, or use it to make French toast, sandwiches, or bread pudding.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Brioche</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense texture. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the dough rise in a warm place:</strong> A warm environment helps the yeast work more effectively, resulting in a better rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Add vanilla extract, citrus zest, or spices like cinnamon to customize your brioche.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. A blend of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch often works well.</p>

        <h3>How do I store gluten-free brioche?</h3>
        <p>Store the brioche in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter. Just ensure that the substitute has a similar fat content to achieve the desired texture.</p>

        <h3>Why is my gluten-free brioche dense?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free brioche can sometimes be denser than traditional brioche due to the lack of gluten. To achieve a lighter texture, make sure to use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend and avoid overmixing the dough.</p>
