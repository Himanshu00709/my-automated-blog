<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your cobbler bakes evenly and achieves the perfect golden-brown topping.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Blueberry Filling</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the fresh blueberries, granulated sugar, and lemon juice. Gently toss the ingredients until the blueberries are evenly coated. Set the mixture aside to allow the flavors to meld while you prepare the topping.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Cut the cold unsalted butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract until the dough just comes together. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Assemble the Cobbler</h3>
<p>Transfer the blueberry mixture to a greased 9x9-inch baking dish. Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler topping evenly over the blueberries. Don’t worry about covering every inch—the topping will spread as it bakes.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the blueberry filling is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
<p>This gluten-free blueberry cobbler is best served warm. You can enjoy it on its own or pair it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra indulgent treat. The contrast between the warm cobbler and the cold ice cream is simply irresistible.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to prevent excess moisture in the filling.</p>

    <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best for this recipe?</h3>
    <p>A 1:1 gluten-free flour blend, such as those from brands like Bob’s Red Mill or King Arthur, works well in this recipe. These blends are designed to mimic the texture of all-purpose flour.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a non-dairy milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This gluten-free blueberry cobbler recipe is a testament to the fact that dietary restrictions don’t have to mean sacrificing flavor or enjoyment. With a few simple substitutions and careful preparation, you can create a dessert that’s both delicious and inclusive. Whether you’re serving it at a family gathering or enjoying it as a cozy treat at home, this blueberry cobbler is sure to be a hit.
