    <h1>Swedish Pancakes: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>Swedish pancakes, known for their thin, crepe-like texture, are a beloved breakfast staple in Sweden and beyond. Traditionally made with wheat flour, these pancakes can easily be adapted to a gluten-free diet without sacrificing their delicate flavor and texture. In this article, we’ll explore the history of Swedish pancakes, how to make them gluten-free, and why they’re a fantastic option for anyone with dietary restrictions.</p>

    <h2>The History of Swedish Pancakes</h2>
    <p>Swedish pancakes, or "pannkakor," have been a part of Swedish cuisine for centuries. Unlike their thicker American counterparts, Swedish pancakes are thin, light, and often served with lingonberry jam, whipped cream, or fresh fruit. They are similar to French crepes but are typically smaller and slightly thicker. The tradition of making pancakes dates back to medieval times, and they have remained a popular dish in Sweden, often enjoyed during family gatherings and holidays.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular due to the rise in gluten-related disorders such as celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. For those who must avoid gluten, finding delicious alternatives to traditional recipes is essential. Swedish pancakes are no exception. By substituting wheat flour with gluten-free alternatives, you can enjoy this classic dish without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and then add the milk and melted butter. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, whisking until the batter is smooth and free of lumps.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat. Lightly grease the pan with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour about ¼ cup of batter into the pan, tilting it to spread the batter evenly into a thin layer.</li>
        <li>Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the edges begin to lift and the bottom is golden brown. Flip the pancake and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, stacking the pancakes on a plate as you go.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings, such as fresh berries, whipped cream, or maple syrup.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Swedish Pancakes</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free Swedish pancakes turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the batter rest:</strong> Allowing the batter to rest for 10-15 minutes before cooking can help the flour absorb the liquid, resulting in a smoother texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Control the heat:</strong> Cooking over medium heat ensures that the pancakes cook evenly without burning.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with toppings:</strong> Swedish pancakes are versatile and can be paired with both sweet and savory toppings. Try Nutella, smoked salmon, or even a sprinkle of powdered sugar.</li>
    </ul>
