    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Sweet Potato Buns</h2>
    <p>Sweet potato buns are not only delicious but also highly nutritious. Sweet potatoes are an excellent source of beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A. This vitamin is essential for maintaining healthy vision, skin, and immune function. Additionally, sweet potatoes are rich in dietary fiber, which aids in digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut.</p>

    <p>By using gluten-free flour, these buns are suitable for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Gluten-free flours, such as almond flour or rice flour, are often lower in carbohydrates and higher in protein compared to traditional wheat flour. This makes sweet potato buns a healthier option for those looking to reduce their carbohydrate intake or increase their protein consumption.</p>
