    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps to remove excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming sticky.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or pot, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until it becomes translucent, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute, being careful not to burn it.</li>
        <li>Add the rinsed rice to the skillet and stir to coat it with the oil or butter. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the rice becomes slightly toasted.</li>
        <li>Pour in the gluten-free broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Stir in the diced carrots and peas during the last 5 minutes of cooking. If you are using nuts, dried fruits, or herbs, you can add them at this time as well.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste, and fluff the rice with a fork before serving.</li>
    </ol>
