    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crock Pot</h3>
    <p>Start by greasing the inside of your crock pot with a little bit of oil or cooking spray. This will prevent the ingredients from sticking to the sides and make cleanup easier.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Place the chicken breasts at the bottom of the crock pot. Add the diced potatoes, frozen mixed vegetables, diced onion, and minced garlic on top of the chicken. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free chicken broth, gluten-free all-purpose flour, heavy cream (or coconut milk), salt, pepper, and thyme. Pour this mixture over the ingredients in the crock pot.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook on Low Heat</h3>
    <p>Cover the crock pot with its lid and set it to cook on low heat for 6-8 hours. The slow cooking process will allow the flavors to meld together and the chicken to become tender and juicy.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Shred the Chicken</h3>
    <p>After the cooking time is up, carefully remove the chicken breasts from the crock pot and shred them using two forks. Return the shredded chicken to the crock pot and stir everything together.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Prepare the Pie Crust</h3>
    <p>While the chicken mixture is cooking, you can prepare your gluten-free pie crust. If you’re using a store-bought crust, follow the package instructions for baking. If you’re making your own, roll out the dough and cut it into strips or shapes to place on top of the pot pie filling.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer the chicken mixture from the crock pot to a baking dish. Arrange the pie crust strips or shapes on top of the filling. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Chicken Pot Pie</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh vegetables and high-quality chicken will enhance the flavor of your pot pie.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Seasonings:</strong> Feel free to adjust the seasonings to suit your taste. You can add more thyme, rosemary, or even a pinch of paprika for extra flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> This recipe is perfect for meal prep. You can prepare the filling in advance and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days before baking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the chicken with turkey or even beef if you prefer. Just adjust the cooking time accordingly to ensure the meat is fully cooked and tender.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the heavy cream with coconut milk or another dairy-free alternative. The flavor will be slightly different, but still delicious.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this dish?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cooked pot pie. Allow it to cool completely, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. It will keep for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before reheating.</p>
