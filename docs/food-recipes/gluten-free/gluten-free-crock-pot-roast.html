    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to prepare your gluten-free crock pot roast:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Season the Roast:</strong> Generously season the beef chuck roast with salt and pepper on all sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Sear the Meat:</strong> In a large skillet, sear the roast on all sides until it develops a rich, brown crust. This step is optional but highly recommended for added flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Vegetables:</strong> While the roast is searing, peel and chop the carrots, potatoes, and onion. Mince the garlic cloves.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer the Ingredients:</strong> Place the chopped vegetables at the bottom of the crock pot. Add the seared roast on top of the vegetables.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Liquids and Seasonings:</strong> Pour the gluten-free beef broth and Worcestershire sauce over the roast. Sprinkle the dried thyme and rosemary evenly over the top.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook:</strong> Cover the crock pot and cook on low for 8-10 hours or on high for 4-6 hours, until the meat is tender and easily shreds with a fork.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once the roast is done, remove it from the crock pot and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing. Serve with the cooked vegetables and a ladle of the flavorful broth.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Crock Pot Roast</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free crock pot roast turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Cut of Meat:</strong> Beef chuck roast is ideal for slow cooking because it has enough fat to keep the meat moist and tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Gluten-Free Broth:</strong> Always check the label on your beef broth to ensure it’s gluten-free. Some broths may contain hidden gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook:</strong> While slow cooking is forgiving, overcooking can result in dry meat. Check the roast after 8 hours on low or 4 hours on high.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Fresh Herbs:</strong> If you have fresh thyme or rosemary on hand, feel free to use them instead of dried herbs for a more vibrant flavor.</li>
    </ul>
