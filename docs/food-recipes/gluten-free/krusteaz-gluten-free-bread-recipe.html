    <h2>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2>

    <p>To make Krusteaz Gluten-Free Bread, you’ll need the following ingredients:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Quantity</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Krusteaz Gluten-Free Bread Mix</td>
                <td>1 package</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>1 1/2 cups</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Eggs</td>
                <td>2 large</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Butter or Oil</td>

    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your bread bakes evenly and rises properly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Bread Pan</h3>
    <p>Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with butter or oil, or line it with parchment paper. This prevents the bread from sticking to the pan.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the Krusteaz Gluten-Free Bread Mix, water, eggs, butter (or oil), and apple cider vinegar. Stir until the mixture is smooth and well combined. Avoid overmixing, as this can affect the texture of the bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Let the Batter Rest</h3>
    <p>Allow the batter to rest for 5-10 minutes. This step is crucial for gluten-free baking, as it gives the ingredients time to hydrate and results in a better texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Bread</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing. This ensures that the bread holds its shape and doesn’t crumble.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Bread</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Cold eggs or water can affect the rise and texture of the bread. Let them come to room temperature before mixing.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense loaf. Stir just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Add seeds, nuts, or dried fruit to the batter for extra flavor and texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Gluten-free bread tends to dry out faster than traditional bread. Store it in an airtight container or wrap it tightly in plastic wrap.</li>
    </ul>
