    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Courgettes:</strong> Grate the courgettes using a box grater. Place the grated courgettes in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much moisture as possible. This step is crucial to ensure the fritters hold together well.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the grated courgettes, gluten-free flour, eggs, minced garlic, chopped parsley, salt, and black pepper. Mix until all ingredients are well incorporated.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong> Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Fritters:</strong> Scoop about 2 tablespoons of the mixture for each fritter and flatten it slightly to form a patty. Carefully place the patties in the hot oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Fritters:</strong> Cook the fritters for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove from the skillet and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the fritters warm with your favorite dipping sauce or a side salad.</li>
