    <h1>Fried Zucchini Gluten-Free: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>Fried zucchini is a beloved dish that combines the natural sweetness and crunch of zucchini with the satisfying crispiness of a fried coating.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Zucchini</h3>
    <p>Start by washing the zucchini thoroughly and patting them dry with a paper towel. Slice the zucchini into 1/4-inch thick rounds or lengthwise strips, depending on your preference. Sprinkle the slices lightly with salt and let them sit for 10 minutes to draw out excess moisture. Pat them dry again before proceeding.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Set Up Your Breading Station</h3>
    <p>Prepare three shallow bowls for the breading process. In the first bowl, place the gluten-free flour. In the second bowl, beat the eggs. In the third bowl, combine the gluten-free breadcrumbs with your chosen seasonings, such as garlic powder, paprika, or Italian herbs.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bread the Zucchini</h3>
    <p>Dip each zucchini slice into the gluten-free flour, shaking off any excess. Next, dip it into the beaten eggs, ensuring it’s fully coated. Finally, press the zucchini into the breadcrumb mixture, making sure it’s evenly covered. Place the breaded zucchini on a plate or baking sheet.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Fry the Zucchini</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the breaded zucchini slices in a single layer, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry each side for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Transfer the fried zucchini to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve the gluten-free fried zucchini immediately while they’re still warm and crispy. They pair wonderfully with a dipping sauce like marinara, ranch, or a simple aioli. These make a great appetizer, side dish, or even a snack!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fried Zucchini</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I bake the zucchini instead of frying?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake the zucchini for a healthier alternative. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and place the breaded zucchini on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Lightly spray or brush the zucchini with olive oil and bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden and crispy.</p>

        <h3>What are the best gluten-free flours to use?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour, rice flour, and gluten-free all-purpose flour blends work well for this recipe. Each flour has a slightly different texture and flavor, so feel free to experiment to find your favorite.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the eggs with a vegan alternative like a flaxseed meal mixture (1 tbsp flaxseed meal + 2.5 tbsp water per egg) or a store-bought egg replacer. Use vegan breadcrumbs to keep the recipe entirely plant-based.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
