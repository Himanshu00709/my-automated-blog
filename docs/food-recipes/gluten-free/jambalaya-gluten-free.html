    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Jambalaya</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free jambalaya is a straightforward process that involves layering flavors and cooking everything in one pot. Here’s how you can do it:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by chopping your vegetables (bell peppers, onions, and celery) and slicing your sausage. If you’re using shrimp, make sure they’re peeled and deveined. Measure out your spices and have your broth ready.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Sausage and Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat some oil over medium heat. Add the sausage and cook until it’s browned. Remove the sausage and set it aside. In the same pot, add the chopped vegetables and sauté until they’re softened, about 5-7 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Rice and Spices</h3>
    <p>Stir in the rice and let it toast for a couple of minutes. This helps to enhance the nutty flavor of the rice. Add your spices (paprika, cayenne, thyme, etc.) and stir to coat the rice and vegetables evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Pour in the Broth and Tomatoes</h3>
    <p>Add the broth and tomatoes to the pot, stirring to combine everything. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Chicken or Shrimp</h3>
    <p>If you’re using chicken, add it during the last 10 minutes of cooking to ensure it’s fully cooked. If you’re using shrimp, add them during the last 5 minutes, as they cook quickly. Stir in the cooked sausage and let everything heat through.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once everything is cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for a few minutes. Serve your gluten-free jambalaya hot, garnished with fresh parsley or green onions if desired.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Jambalaya</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use any type of rice for gluten-free jambalaya?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any type of rice, but long-grain rice is traditionally used in jambalaya because it holds up well during cooking and doesn’t become too sticky. Just make sure the rice is labeled gluten-free to avoid cross-contamination.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of Andouille sausage?</h3>
        <p>If you can’t find gluten-free Andouille sausage, you can use any other gluten-free sausage, such as chorizo or smoked sausage. Alternatively, you can make your own sausage at home using gluten-free ingredients.</p>

        <h3>Is jambalaya spicy?</h3>
        <p>Jambalaya can be as spicy as you like. The level of heat depends on the amount of cayenne pepper and other spices you use. If you prefer a milder dish, you can reduce the amount of cayenne or omit it altogether.</p>

        <h3>Can I make jambalaya ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, jambalaya can be made ahead of time and reheated. In fact, the flavors often deepen and improve after sitting for a day. Store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator and reheat it on the stove or in the microwave.</p>
