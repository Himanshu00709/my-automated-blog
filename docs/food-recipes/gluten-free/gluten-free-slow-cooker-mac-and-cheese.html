<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pasta</h3>
<p>Start by cooking the gluten-free elbow macaroni according to the package instructions. Be sure to cook it al dente, as it will continue to soften in the slow cooker. Drain the pasta and set it aside.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Make the Cheese Sauce</h3>
<p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in the gluten-free flour to create a roux. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly. Gradually add the milk, whisking continuously to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, then reduce the heat and stir in the shredded cheddar cheese until melted and smooth. Season with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and paprika (if using).</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine and Cook</h3>
<p>In your slow cooker, combine the cooked pasta and cheese sauce. Stir well to ensure the pasta is evenly coated. Cover and cook on low for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Avoid overcooking, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once the mac and cheese is creamy and heated through, serve it hot. Garnish with additional shredded cheese or a sprinkle of paprika for extra flavor. Pair it with a side salad or steamed vegetables for a complete meal.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Choose the Right Pasta:</strong> Not all gluten-free pastas are created equal. Look for brands that hold their shape well during cooking, such as those made from brown rice or quinoa.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Freshly Shredded Cheese:</strong> Pre-shredded cheese often contains anti-caking agents that can affect the texture of your sauce. Shred your cheese for a smoother, creamier result.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overcook:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to soften faster than traditional pasta. Keep an eye on the cooking time to avoid a mushy texture.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Slow Cooker Mac and Cheese</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! While sharp cheddar is a classic choice, you can experiment with other cheeses like Gouda, Monterey Jack, or even a blend of cheeses for a unique flavor profile.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute dairy-free cheese and milk alternatives like almond milk or oat milk. Just ensure that the cheese melts well to achieve a creamy texture.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop, adding a splash of milk to restore creaminess.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze this dish?</h3>
    <p>While you can freeze gluten-free mac and cheese, the texture may change slightly upon thawing. For best results, consume it fresh or refrigerated.</p>
