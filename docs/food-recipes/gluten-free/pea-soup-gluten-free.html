<h1>Gluten-Free Pea Soup: A Nutritious and Delicious Choice</h1>

<p>Pea soup has been a staple in many cultures for centuries, known for its rich flavor, hearty texture, and nutritional benefits. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding comforting and satisfying meals can sometimes be a challenge. Fortunately, pea soup is naturally gluten-free, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to enjoy a wholesome meal without worrying about gluten. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free pea soup, how to make it, and answer some common questions about this delightful dish.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Pea Soup?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those who simply choose to avoid gluten for health reasons. Pea soup, made from split peas, is naturally free from gluten, making it a safe and nutritious option. Beyond its gluten-free status, pea soup is packed with protein, fiber, and essential vitamins and minerals, making it a powerhouse of nutrition.</p>

<p>Split peas, the main ingredient in pea soup, are a great source of plant-based protein, which is particularly beneficial for vegetarians and vegans. They also contain high levels of dietary fiber, which aids in digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut. Additionally, split peas are rich in iron, potassium, and B vitamins, all of which contribute to overall health and well-being.</p>

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Pea Soup</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free pea soup is simple and requires just a few basic ingredients. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating a delicious and nutritious pot of pea soup:</p>

    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Rinse the Split Peas:</strong> Start by rinsing the split peas under cold water to remove any debris or dust.</li>
    <li><strong>Sauté the Vegetables:</strong> In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery, and sauté until the vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the Split Peas and Broth:</strong> Stir in the rinsed split peas, broth, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer.</li>
    <li><strong>Simmer:</strong> Allow the soup to simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the split peas are tender and the soup has thickened. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Season:</strong> Remove the bay leaves and season the soup with salt and pepper to taste. If you prefer a smoother texture, you can use an immersion blender to partially puree the soup.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Ladle the soup into bowls and serve hot. You can garnish with fresh herbs or a drizzle of olive oil if desired.</li>
