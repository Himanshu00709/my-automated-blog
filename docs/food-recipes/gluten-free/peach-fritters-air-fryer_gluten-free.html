    <h1>Peach Fritters in the Air Fryer: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>Peach fritters are a delightful treat that combines the sweetness of ripe peaches with the satisfying crunch of a perfectly fried dough. Traditionally, fritters are deep-fried, which can make them heavy and calorie-laden. However, with the advent of air fryers, you can now enjoy these delicious treats with a fraction of the oil and calories. Moreover, by making them gluten-free, you can cater to those with dietary restrictions without compromising on taste or texture. In this blog post, we’ll explore how to make peach fritters in an air fryer, ensuring they are both gluten-free and irresistibly delicious.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Air Fryer Peach Fritters?</h2>
    <p>Air fryers have revolutionized the way we cook by providing a healthier alternative to traditional frying methods. They use hot air circulation to cook food, resulting in a crispy exterior without the need for excessive oil. This makes air fryer peach fritters a healthier option, especially for those who are mindful of their calorie intake. Additionally, air fryers are incredibly convenient, reducing cooking time and making cleanup a breeze.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, salt, and sugar. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense fritters. Gently fold in the diced peaches.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Preheat the Air Fryer</h3>
    <p>Preheat your air fryer to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that the fritters cook evenly and achieve a crispy exterior. While the air fryer is heating, lightly spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray or brush it with a small amount of oil to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Form and Cook the Fritters</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or a small ice cream scoop, drop portions of the batter into the air fryer basket, leaving space between each fritter to allow for even cooking. Depending on the size of your air fryer, you may need to cook the fritters in batches. Cook for 8-10 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the fritters are golden brown and cooked through.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the fritters are done, remove them from the air fryer and let them cool slightly. You can dust them with powdered sugar, drizzle them with honey, or serve them with a dollop of whipped cream for an extra indulgent treat. Enjoy your gluten-free peach fritters warm for the best flavor and texture.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Peach Fritters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Ripe Peaches:</strong> The sweetness and juiciness of ripe peaches will enhance the flavor of your fritters. If fresh peaches are not available, you can use thawed frozen peaches, but be sure to drain any excess liquid.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough fritters. Mix the batter until just combined, and don’t worry if there are a few lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Cooking Time:</strong> Air fryers can vary in temperature and cooking time, so keep an eye on your fritters and adjust the cooking time as needed to achieve the desired level of crispiness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While peaches are the star of this recipe, you can easily substitute them with other fruits like apples, berries, or even bananas. Just make sure to adjust the cooking time if the fruit has a different moisture content.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these fritters ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the batter ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. When you’re ready to cook, simply give the batter a quick stir and proceed with the recipe as directed.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover fritters?</h3>
        <p>Leftover fritters can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. To reheat, place them in the air fryer for a few minutes until warmed through and crispy.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze these fritters?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cooked fritters. Allow them to cool completely, then place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze until solid. Transfer the frozen fritters to a zip-top bag or airtight container and store for up to 3 months. To reheat, place them in the air fryer at 350°F (175°C) for 5-7 minutes.</p>
