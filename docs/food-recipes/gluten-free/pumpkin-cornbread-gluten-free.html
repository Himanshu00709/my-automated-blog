    <h1>Gluten-Free Pumpkin Cornbread: A Fall Delight</h1>
    <p>As the leaves begin to change and the air turns crisp, there's nothing quite like the comforting aroma of freshly baked pumpkin cornbread wafting through your kitchen. This gluten-free version of the classic cornbread is not only a delicious treat but also a healthier alternative for those with gluten sensitivities. Whether you're hosting a fall gathering or simply craving a cozy snack, this pumpkin cornbread is sure to become a seasonal favorite.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Pumpkin Cornbread?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance but also among individuals seeking to reduce inflammation or improve digestive health. Traditional cornbread recipes often include wheat flour, which contains gluten. By substituting gluten-free flour blends, you can enjoy the same moist, crumbly texture without the adverse effects of gluten.</p>
    <p>Adding pumpkin to the mix not only enhances the flavor but also boosts the nutritional profile. Pumpkin is rich in vitamins A and C, fiber, and antioxidants, making this cornbread a guilt-free indulgence. The combination of pumpkin and cornmeal creates a unique, slightly sweet, and earthy flavor that perfectly complements the season.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan or cast-iron skillet with butter or oil to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free cornmeal, gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and pumpkin pie spice (if using). Whisk these dry ingredients together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs, milk, honey or maple syrup, and melted butter or coconut oil. Ensure the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Gently fold the mixture together until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cornbread.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan or skillet. Smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cornbread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before slicing. Serve warm with a drizzle of honey or a dollop of butter for an extra touch of indulgence.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh pumpkin puree. Simply roast a small sugar pumpkin, remove the skin, and blend the flesh until smooth. Ensure it has a similar consistency to canned pumpkin puree.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and use a dairy-free milk and butter alternative. The texture may be slightly different, but it will still be delicious.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store leftover cornbread?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover cornbread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
    </div>
