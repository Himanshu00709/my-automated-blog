<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
<p>Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper on both sides. In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes. Remove the chicken and set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
<p>In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in the sliced bell peppers and mushrooms, cooking until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add the Tomatoes and Seasonings</h3>
<p>Stir in the canned diced tomatoes, tomato paste, red wine (if using), and chicken broth. Add the dried oregano, basil, and bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the mixture to a simmer.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Braise the Chicken</h3>
<p>Return the chicken thighs to the skillet, nestling them into the sauce. Cover the skillet and reduce the heat to low. Let the chicken simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</h3>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked, remove the bay leaf and discard it. Garnish the dish with freshly chopped parsley. Serve the Chicken Cacciatore hot, ideally over gluten-free pasta, rice, or with a side of crusty gluten-free bread.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chicken Cacciatore</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Is Chicken Cacciatore naturally gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, Chicken Cacciatore is naturally gluten-free as it primarily consists of chicken, vegetables, and tomatoes. However, it’s essential to check the labels of store-bought ingredients like chicken broth, canned tomatoes, and wine to ensure they are gluten-free.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I make Chicken Cacciatore without wine?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! If you prefer not to use wine, you can substitute it with additional chicken broth or even a splash of balsamic vinegar for added depth of flavor.</p>

    <h3>3. What can I serve with Chicken Cacciatore?</h3>
    <p>Chicken Cacciatore pairs well with gluten-free pasta, rice, or mashed potatoes. You can also serve it with a side of steamed vegetables or a fresh salad.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I use chicken breasts instead of thighs?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use chicken breasts if you prefer. However, chicken thighs are more flavorful and tend to stay juicier during the braising process. If using chicken breasts, reduce the cooking time slightly to prevent them from drying out.</p>
