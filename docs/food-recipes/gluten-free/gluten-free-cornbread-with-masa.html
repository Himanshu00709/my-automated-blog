    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cornbread with Masa</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular cornmeal instead of gluten-free cornmeal?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular cornmeal if you don’t have a gluten intolerance. However, ensure that the cornmeal is labeled gluten-free if you’re cooking for someone with celiac disease, as cross-contamination can occur during processing.</p>
