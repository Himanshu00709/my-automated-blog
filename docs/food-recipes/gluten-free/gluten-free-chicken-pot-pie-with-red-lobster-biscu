    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get cooking! Follow these step-by-step instructions to create a delicious gluten-free chicken pot pie:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the gluten-free flour blend and whisk until smooth. Gradually add the chicken broth and milk, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens. Add the shredded chicken and mixed vegetables, and season with salt and pepper. Cook for another 5-7 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the gluten-free pie crust and place it into a pie dish. Pour the chicken and vegetable mixture into the crust. Cover with the top crust, sealing the edges with a fork. Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Pie</h3>
    <p>Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Red Lobster Biscuits</h2>
    <p>No chicken pot pie is complete without a side of biscuits, and Red Lobster’s famous Cheddar Bay Biscuits are a fan favorite. Here’s how to make a gluten-free version of these cheesy, buttery delights:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Quantity</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Gluten-free baking mix</td>
                <td>2 cups</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Shredded cheddar cheese</td>
                <td>1 cup</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Garlic powder</td>
                <td>1/2 tsp</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Butter (melted)</td>
                <td>1/2 cup</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Milk (or dairy-free alternative)</td>
                <td>2/3 cup</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Step 1: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free baking mix, shredded cheddar cheese, and garlic powder. Add the melted butter and milk, and stir until a soft dough forms.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Form the Biscuits</h3>
    <p>Drop spoonfuls of the dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 10-12 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Brush with Butter</h3>
    <p>While the biscuits are still warm, brush them with additional melted butter and sprinkle with a little extra garlic powder for that signature Red Lobster flavor.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour for the pot pie?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. Just make sure it’s a 1:1 substitute for regular flour to ensure the right consistency.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the biscuits ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the biscuit dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before baking. This makes it easy to have fresh, warm biscuits ready to serve with your pot pie.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the pot pie?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the pot pie either before or after baking. If freezing before baking, simply assemble the pie, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and foil, and freeze. When ready to bake, you can cook it directly from frozen, adding extra time as needed.</p>
