    <h1>Gluten-Free Monster Cookie Recipe</h1>
    <p>Monster cookies are a beloved treat, known for their chewy texture and delightful mix of flavors. Traditionally, they are packed with oats, peanut butter, chocolate chips, and M&M's.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free monster cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free oats, gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugars:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, peanut butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Mix-ins:</strong> Gently fold in the gluten-free chocolate chips and M&M's.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop Dough:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may look slightly underbaked, but they will firm up as they cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Monster Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Certified Gluten-Free Oats:</strong> Regular oats can sometimes be contaminated with gluten during processing. Always use certified gluten-free oats to ensure safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky, chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before scooping. This will make it easier to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Mix-ins:</strong> Feel free to customize your cookies with different mix-ins like dried fruit, nuts, or white chocolate chips.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>No, regular flour contains gluten, which will make the cookies unsuitable for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Always use a gluten-free flour blend for this recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make vegan gluten-free monster cookies by substituting the butter with vegan butter, the egg with a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water), and using vegan chocolate chips and M&M's.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use almond butter instead of peanut butter?</h3>
        <p>Yes, almond butter can be used as a substitute for peanut butter. However, keep in mind that it will alter the flavor slightly.</p>
