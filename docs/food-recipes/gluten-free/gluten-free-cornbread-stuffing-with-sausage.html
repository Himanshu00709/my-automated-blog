<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Cornbread</h3>
<p>Start by baking or purchasing a gluten-free cornbread. Once cooled, cut it into 1-inch cubes and let them sit out overnight to dry slightly. This step ensures the stuffing has the right texture.</p>

<h3>2. Cook the Sausage</h3>
<p>In a large skillet, cook the ground sausage over medium heat until browned and cooked through. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside, leaving the drippings in the pan.</p>

<h3>3. Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
<p>In the same skillet, add the diced onion, celery, and minced garlic. Sauté until the vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes. This step builds the flavor base for your stuffing.</p>

<h3>4. Combine Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cubed cornbread, cooked sausage, and sautéed vegetables. Add the chopped parsley and sage, then season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<h3>5. Add Broth</h3>
<p>Gradually pour the chicken or vegetable broth over the mixture, stirring gently to combine. The cornbread should be moist but not soggy. Adjust the amount of broth as needed.</p>

<h3>6. Bake the Stuffing</h3>
<p>Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 30-40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the stuffing is heated through.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

<p>Gluten-free cornbread stuffing with sausage is not only delicious but also offers several nutritional benefits. Cornmeal is a good source of fiber and essential minerals like magnesium and iron. Sausage provides protein and healthy fats, while the vegetables add vitamins and antioxidants. This dish is a well-rounded addition to any meal, offering both flavor and nutrition.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make this stuffing ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the stuffing up to a day in advance. Simply assemble the ingredients, cover the dish, and refrigerate. When you’re ready to serve, bake it as directed, adding a few extra minutes to the cooking time if needed.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! While sausage is a popular choice, you can substitute it with ground turkey, chicken, or even a plant-based sausage for a vegetarian option.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Leftover stuffing can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat it in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

    <h3>Is this stuffing suitable for freezing?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the stuffing for up to 2 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and reheat it in the oven until warmed through.</p>
