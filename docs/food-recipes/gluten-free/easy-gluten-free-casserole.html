    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making a Gluten-Free Casserole</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Choose Your Base</h3>
    <p>The base of your casserole will determine its texture and flavor. Popular gluten-free bases include cooked quinoa, rice, or gluten-free pasta. These ingredients provide a hearty foundation and help absorb the flavors of the other components.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add Protein</h3>
    <p>Protein is an essential part of any casserole. You can use lean meats like chicken or turkey, or opt for plant-based proteins like beans, lentils, or tofu. Make sure to cook your protein thoroughly before adding it to the casserole.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Incorporate Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Vegetables not only add color and texture but also boost the nutritional value of your casserole. Consider using a mix of fresh or frozen vegetables like broccoli, spinach, bell peppers, or zucchini. Chop them into bite-sized pieces for even cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Create a Flavorful Sauce</h3>
    <p>The sauce is what ties everything together. For a gluten-free casserole, you can make a simple cheese sauce using gluten-free flour and milk, or a creamy sauce using coconut milk or almond milk. Add herbs and spices to enhance the flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Top It Off</h3>
    <p>To give your casserole a crispy topping, sprinkle it with gluten-free breadcrumbs, crushed gluten-free crackers, or shredded cheese. This adds a delightful contrast to the creamy interior.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake and Serve</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and bake the casserole for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>
