    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Rinse the Rice</h3>
    <p>Start by rinsing the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This step removes excess starch and helps prevent the rice from becoming too sticky.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Onion and Garlic</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until it becomes translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Then, add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Toast the Rice</h3>
    <p>Add the rinsed rice to the skillet and stir to coat it with the oil, onion, and garlic mixture. Toast the rice for about 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it becomes slightly golden. This step enhances the nutty flavor of the rice.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Tomato Sauce and Spices</h3>
    <p>Stir in the tomato sauce, ground cumin, chili powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to ensure that the rice is evenly coated with the sauce and spices.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cook the Rice</h3>
    <p>Pour in the gluten-free chicken or vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and let the rice simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fluff and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the rice is cooked, remove it from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Then, fluff the rice with a fork and garnish with fresh cilantro if desired. Serve hot as a side dish or as a base for your favorite protein.</p>
