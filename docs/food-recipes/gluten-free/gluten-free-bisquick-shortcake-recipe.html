    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). This ensures that your shortcake bakes evenly and rises properly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the Gluten-Free Bisquick and sugar. Add the cold, cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and vanilla extract. Pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense shortcake.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Shape the Shortcakes</h3>
    <p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour if necessary). Gently pat the dough into a circle about 1/2 inch thick. Use a round biscuit cutter or a glass to cut out individual shortcakes. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Bake the shortcakes in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Assemble Your Shortcake</h3>
    <p>To assemble your shortcake, slice the baked shortcakes in half horizontally. Place a generous amount of sliced strawberries on the bottom half, top with whipped cream, and then place the other half of the shortcake on top. Garnish with additional strawberries and a dollop of whipped cream if desired.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Shortcake</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for creating a flaky texture in your shortcake. Make sure your butter is well-chilled before incorporating it into the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to a tough shortcake. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Use fresh strawberries and high-quality whipped cream for the best flavor. If strawberries are out of season, you can use other fresh fruits like blueberries or peaches.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store any leftover shortcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. You can also freeze the baked shortcakes for up to a month.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour mix?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a different gluten-free flour mix, but the texture and flavor may vary slightly. Gluten-Free Bisquick is specifically formulated to mimic the texture of traditional Bisquick, so it’s recommended for this recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and use a non-dairy milk such as almond milk or oat milk. For the whipped cream, you can use a non-dairy whipped topping.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other fruits to the shortcake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize your shortcake with any fruits you like. Blueberries, raspberries, peaches, and even bananas make excellent additions.</p>

        <h3>How do I know when the shortcakes are done baking?</h3>
        <p>The shortcakes are done when they are golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Be careful not to overbake, as this can dry out the shortcakes.</p>
    </div>

With just a few simple ingredients and some basic baking techniques, you can enjoy a classic dessert that’s safe for those with gluten sensitivities.
