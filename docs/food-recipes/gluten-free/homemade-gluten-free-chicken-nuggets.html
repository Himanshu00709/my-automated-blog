    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Start by cutting the chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces, roughly 1 to 1.5 inches in size. Pat the chicken pieces dry with a paper towel to ensure the coating adheres properly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Set Up Your Breading Station</h3>
    <p>In three separate bowls, prepare your breading station. In the first bowl, place the gluten-free flour. In the second bowl, beat the eggs. In the third bowl, mix the gluten-free breadcrumbs with the garlic powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Coat the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Dip each piece of chicken first into the gluten-free flour, ensuring it’s fully coated. Next, dip it into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off. Finally, coat the chicken in the seasoned breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to ensure the breadcrumbs stick.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Nuggets</h3>
    <p>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the breaded chicken pieces in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until the nuggets are golden brown and cooked through. Transfer the cooked nuggets to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve your homemade gluten-free chicken nuggets with your favorite dipping sauces, such as honey mustard, barbecue sauce, or a gluten-free ranch dressing. They’re perfect as a snack, appetizer, or even a main dish when paired with a side of vegetables or a salad.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Homemade Gluten-Free Chicken Nuggets</h2>

    <p>Homemade gluten-free chicken nuggets offer several health benefits compared to their store-bought counterparts. By using lean chicken breast, you’re getting a good source of high-quality protein, which is essential for muscle repair and growth. The gluten-free coating, made from almond flour or chickpea flour, provides additional nutrients such as fiber, healthy fats, and vitamins. Additionally, by avoiding processed ingredients and additives, you’re reducing your intake of unhealthy fats, sodium, and artificial preservatives.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I bake the chicken nuggets instead of frying them?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake the chicken nuggets for a healthier alternative. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and place the breaded nuggets on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Lightly spray the nuggets with cooking oil and bake for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through, until they’re golden brown and cooked through.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can use any gluten-free flour you prefer, such as almond flour, rice flour, chickpea flour, or even a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Each type of flour will give the nuggets a slightly different texture and flavor, so feel free to experiment.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftover chicken nuggets?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover chicken nuggets in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, place them in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes, or until heated through. You can also reheat them in an air fryer for a crispy texture.</p>

        <h3>Are these chicken nuggets suitable for kids?</h3>
        <p>Yes, these homemade gluten-free chicken nuggets are a great option for kids. They’re free from gluten and artificial additives, making them a healthier choice for children. Plus, you can customize the seasoning to suit your child’s taste preferences.</p>
