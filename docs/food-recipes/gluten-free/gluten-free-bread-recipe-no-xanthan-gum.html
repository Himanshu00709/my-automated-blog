    <h1>Gluten-Free Bread Recipe Without Xanthan Gum</h1>

    <p>Gluten-free baking can be a challenge, especially when you're trying to avoid common additives like xanthan gum. Xanthan gum is often used in gluten-free recipes to mimic the elasticity and structure that gluten provides. However, some people prefer to avoid it due to dietary restrictions or personal preferences. In this article, we'll explore a delicious and easy-to-make gluten-free bread recipe that doesn't rely on xanthan gum. Whether you're new to gluten-free baking or a seasoned pro, this recipe is sure to become a staple in your kitchen.</p>

    <h2>Why Avoid Xanthan Gum?</h2>

    <p>Xanthan gum is a common ingredient in gluten-free baking, but it's not without its drawbacks. Some people experience digestive discomfort when consuming xanthan gum, while others simply prefer to avoid processed additives. Fortunately, there are natural alternatives that can provide the same binding and thickening properties. In this recipe, we'll use a combination of psyllium husk and flaxseed meal to achieve the desired texture and structure.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>Here's what you'll need to make this gluten-free bread:</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these steps to make your gluten-free bread:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a loaf pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, psyllium husk, flaxseed meal, baking powder, and salt. Whisk until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the warm water, apple cider vinegar, olive oil, and eggs (or flax eggs). Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Knead the dough for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. This helps to activate the psyllium husk and flaxseed meal, which will give the bread its structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Shape the dough into a loaf and place it in the prepared loaf pan. Smooth the top with a spatula or your hands.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the bread in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free bread turns out perfectly:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Good Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Skip the Psyllium Husk:</strong> Psyllium husk is crucial for binding the dough and giving the bread its structure. If you don't have psyllium husk, you can try using chia seeds, but the texture may be slightly different.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Bread Cool Completely:</strong> Gluten-free bread can be a bit crumbly when it's warm. Letting it cool completely will make it easier to slice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a different gluten-free flour blend, but the texture and flavor of the bread may vary. Look for a blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch for the best results.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this bread vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the eggs with flax eggs. To make a flax egg, mix 1 tablespoon of flaxseed meal with 3 tablespoons of water and let it sit for 5 minutes until it becomes gel-like. Use two flax eggs in place of the regular eggs.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the bread for up to 3 months. Just slice it before freezing for easy thawing.</p>
