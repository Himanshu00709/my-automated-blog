    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a loaf pan with a little oil or line it with parchment paper to prevent the bread from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the buckwheat flour, almond flour, psyllium husk, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure that all the dry ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs (or flax eggs), olive oil, water, and apple cider vinegar. If you're using flax eggs, mix 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed with 3 tablespoons of water for each egg and let it sit for 5 minutes to thicken.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until a thick dough forms. The psyllium husk will help bind the dough, giving it a bread-like texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Shape the Dough</h3>
    <p>Transfer the dough to the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. You can also sprinkle some seeds like sesame or sunflower on top for added texture and flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Bread</h3>
    <p>Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve with your favorite toppings, such as avocado, nut butter, or jam.</p>
