    <h1>Gluten-Free Slow Cooker Pulled Pork: A Delicious and Easy Recipe</h1>

    <p>Pulled pork is a classic comfort food that’s perfect for family dinners, gatherings, or meal prep. But if you’re following a gluten-free diet, finding recipes that fit your needs can be a challenge. The good news? Slow cooker pulled pork is naturally gluten-free when made with the right ingredients, and it’s incredibly easy to prepare. In this blog post, we’ll walk you through a step-by-step guide to making tender, flavorful gluten-free pulled pork in your slow cooker. Plus, we’ll answer some frequently asked questions to ensure your dish turns out perfectly every time.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Slow Cooker Pulled Pork?</h2>

    <p>Slow cookers are a game-changer for busy individuals and families. They allow you to prepare meals with minimal effort, and the long, slow cooking process ensures that the meat becomes incredibly tender and flavorful. Pulled pork is particularly well-suited for slow cooking because the low heat breaks down the tough connective tissues in the pork shoulder, resulting in meat that’s easy to shred and packed with flavor.</p>

    <p>When it comes to gluten-free cooking, slow cookers are also a great option because they allow you to control the ingredients that go into your dish. By using gluten-free sauces and seasonings, you can create a meal that’s safe for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pork</h3>

    <p>Start by trimming any excess fat from the pork shoulder. While some fat is necessary for flavor and moisture, too much can make the dish greasy. Once trimmed, pat the pork dry with paper towels. This helps the seasoning stick to the meat.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Season the Pork</h3>

    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Rub this seasoning mixture all over the pork shoulder, ensuring it’s evenly coated. This step is crucial for building layers of flavor in your pulled pork.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Liquid Ingredients</h3>

    <p>In your slow cooker, combine the gluten-free barbecue sauce, apple cider vinegar, chicken or vegetable broth, and brown sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved and the ingredients are well combined. This mixture will serve as the cooking liquid and sauce for your pulled pork.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Pork</h3>

    <p>Place the seasoned pork shoulder into the slow cooker, making sure it’s submerged in the liquid. Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours or on high for 4-6 hours. The longer cooking time on low heat will yield the most tender results.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Shred the Pork</h3>

    <p>Once the pork is cooked, remove it from the slow cooker and place it on a large cutting board. Use two forks to shred the meat, discarding any large pieces of fat. Return the shredded pork to the slow cooker and mix it with the cooking liquid. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes to absorb the flavors.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Your gluten-free slow cooker pulled pork is now ready to serve! It’s perfect on gluten-free buns, over rice, or even as a topping for salads. Add your favorite gluten-free sides, such as coleslaw or roasted vegetables, for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Slow Cooker Pulled Pork</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different cut of pork?</h3>
        <p>While pork shoulder (also known as pork butt) is the best cut for pulled pork due to its fat content and tenderness, you can use other cuts like pork loin. However, leaner cuts may result in slightly drier meat.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I know if my barbecue sauce is gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Always check the label for gluten-free certification or look for sauces that don’t contain wheat, barley, or rye. Many brands now offer gluten-free options, but it’s always best to double-check.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this recipe in an Instant Pot?</h3>
        <p>Yes! You can adapt this recipe for an Instant Pot by cooking the pork on high pressure for about 90 minutes, followed by a natural release. Shred the pork as usual and mix it with the sauce.</p>

        <h3>4. How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover pulled pork in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop with a splash of broth to keep it moist.</p>
