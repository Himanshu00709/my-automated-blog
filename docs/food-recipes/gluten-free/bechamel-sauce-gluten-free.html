    <p>Béchamel sauce, also known as white sauce, is a classic French sauce that serves as the foundation for many dishes, from lasagna to macaroni and cheese.

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Béchamel Sauce</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free béchamel sauce is similar to the traditional method, with a few adjustments. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Roux</h3>
    <p>In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the gluten-free flour and whisk continuously to form a smooth paste. Cook the roux for 1-2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste, but be careful not to let it brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Milk</h3>
    <p>Gradually pour in the milk while whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Continue to whisk until the mixture thickens and comes to a gentle simmer.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Season the Sauce</h3>
    <p>Once the sauce has thickened, season it with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Use or Store</h3>
    <p>Your gluten-free béchamel sauce is now ready to use in your favorite recipes. If you’re not using it immediately, you can store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove, adding a splash of milk if needed to restore the consistency.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Béchamel</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free béchamel sauce turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours behave the same way. Rice flour and almond flour are popular choices, but you can also use a gluten-free flour blend designed for baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk Constantly:</strong> To avoid lumps, whisk continuously while adding the milk to the roux.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Consistency:</strong> If your sauce is too thick, add more milk a little at a time until you reach the desired consistency. If it’s too thin, cook it a bit longer to thicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add grated cheese, garlic, or herbs to customize your béchamel sauce for different dishes.</li>
    </ul>
