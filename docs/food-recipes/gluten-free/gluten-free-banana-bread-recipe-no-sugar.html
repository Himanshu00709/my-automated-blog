    <h1>Gluten-Free Banana Bread Recipe (No Sugar)</h1>
    <p>Banana bread is a classic comfort food that many of us love. However, for those who are gluten-intolerant or looking to reduce their sugar intake, traditional recipes may not be suitable.

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free and No-Sugar Banana Bread?</h2>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to make your gluten-free, no-sugar banana bread:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a loaf pan with a little oil or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash the bananas:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Add wet ingredients:</strong> Add the eggs, unsweetened applesauce, honey or maple syrup, and vanilla extract to the mashed bananas. Mix well until combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon (if using).</li>
        <li><strong>Mix wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Add optional ingredients:</strong> If you’re using chopped nuts or seeds, fold them into the batter at this stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the banana bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Banana Bread</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your banana bread turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use ripe bananas:</strong> The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more flavorful your bread will be. Look for bananas with brown spots on the skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose the right flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. A blend of rice flour, almond flour, and tapioca flour works well for this recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense and tough loaf. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking your bread at the 50-minute mark. If the top is browning too quickly, cover it loosely with aluminum foil.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different sweetener?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute honey or maple syrup with other natural sweeteners like agave nectar or date syrup. However, keep in mind that the flavor and texture may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>To make this recipe vegan, you can replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg). Ensure that your gluten-free flour blend is also vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the banana bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the banana bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add chocolate chips?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you’d like to add chocolate chips, make sure to use sugar-free or dark chocolate chips to keep the recipe low in sugar.</p>
