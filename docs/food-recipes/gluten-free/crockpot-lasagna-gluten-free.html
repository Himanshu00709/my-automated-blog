    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Meat Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef or turkey over medium heat. Drain any excess fat, then add the minced garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in the marinara sauce, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Cheese Filling</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, half of the shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, and the egg. Mix well until the ingredients are fully incorporated. This creamy mixture will add richness and depth to your lasagna.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Layer the Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Begin by spreading a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom of your crockpot. This prevents the noodles from sticking. Next, place a layer of gluten-free lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. You may need to break the noodles to fit the shape of your crockpot. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by another layer of meat sauce. Repeat this process until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook in the Crockpot</h3>
    <p>Cover the crockpot and cook on low heat for 4-6 hours or on high heat for 2-3 hours. About 30 minutes before the cooking time is up, sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese on top. This will create a gooey, golden crust that’s irresistible.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the lasagna is cooked, let it sit for about 10 minutes before serving. This allows the layers to set, making it easier to slice. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired, and enjoy your gluten-free crockpot lasagna!</p>
