    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free green bean casserole:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Set your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the green beans:</strong> If using fresh green beans, trim the ends and cut them into bite-sized pieces. If using frozen green beans, thaw them completely and drain any excess water.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the Progresso Creamy Mushroom Soup, milk, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. Stir until well combined. Add the green beans and mix until they are evenly coated with the soup mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Transfer to the baking dish:</strong> Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and spread it out evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the toppings:</strong> Sprinkle the gluten-free fried onions evenly over the top of the casserole. If you’re using shredded cheese, add it now as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the casserole in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the casserole is bubbly and the onions are golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove the casserole from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Green Bean Casserole</h2>

        <li><strong>Don’t skip the fried onions:</strong> The crispy fried onions are a key component of the casserole. Make sure to use a gluten-free version to keep the dish safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with toppings:</strong> If you’re not a fan of fried onions, try using crushed gluten-free crackers or breadcrumbs as a topping instead.</li>
