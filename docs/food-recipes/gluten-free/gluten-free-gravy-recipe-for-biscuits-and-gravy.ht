<h1>Gluten-Free Gravy Recipe for Biscuits and Gravy</h1>

<p>Biscuits and gravy is a classic comfort food that many people love, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this dish can be a challenge. Traditional gravy is made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, with a few simple substitutions, you can create a delicious gluten-free gravy that pairs perfectly with your favorite gluten-free biscuits. In this article, we'll walk you through a step-by-step guide to making gluten-free gravy, along with tips and tricks to ensure it turns out perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Gravy?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause serious health issues for people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Even if you don't have a gluten-related condition, you might choose to avoid gluten for other health reasons. Fortunately, making gluten-free gravy is easier than you might think. By using gluten-free flour and other simple ingredients, you can enjoy a rich, flavorful gravy that's safe for everyone to eat.</p>

<h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Gravy</h2>

<p>Here’s what you’ll need to make gluten-free gravy:</p>

    <tr>
        <th>Ingredient</th>
        <th>Quantity</th>

        <td>1/2 cup</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Roux</h3>

<p>Start by melting the butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Once the butter is melted, add the gluten-free flour and whisk continuously to combine. Cook the mixture for about 2-3 minutes, or until it becomes slightly golden in color. This step is crucial as it helps to cook out the raw flour taste and thickens the gravy.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Add the Milk</h3>

<p>Slowly pour in the milk while whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Continue to whisk until the mixture is smooth and begins to thicken. This should take about 5-7 minutes. If you prefer a thicker gravy, you can let it simmer for a few more minutes. If it’s too thick, you can add a little more milk to reach your desired consistency.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Season the Gravy</h3>

<p>Once the gravy has thickened, season it with salt and pepper to taste. If you’re using cooked sausage or bacon crumbles, now is the time to stir them in. This will add a delicious savory flavor to your gravy. Let the gravy simmer for another 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Your gluten-free gravy is now ready to serve! Pour it over warm gluten-free biscuits and enjoy a comforting, hearty meal that’s safe for everyone at the table.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Gravy</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a good quality gluten-free flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Rice flour and almond flour are popular choices, but you can also use a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend.</li>
    <li><strong>Whisk continuously:</strong> To avoid lumps, make sure to whisk the gravy continuously as you add the milk.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust the consistency:</strong> If your gravy is too thick, add more milk. If it’s too thin, let it simmer a bit longer to thicken.</li>
    <li><strong>Add flavor:</strong> Don’t be afraid to experiment with additional seasonings like garlic powder, onion powder, or even a pinch of cayenne pepper for a little kick.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make this gravy ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make the gravy ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. When you’re ready to serve, simply reheat it on the stovetop, adding a little milk if needed to adjust the consistency.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free gravy?</h3>
    <p>While you can freeze gluten-free gravy, the texture may change slightly upon thawing. To freeze, let the gravy cool completely, then transfer it to an airtight container or freezer bag. It can be stored in the freezer for up to 2 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before reheating.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of butter?</h3>
    <p>If you’re dairy-free, you can use a gluten-free margarine or a neutral-tasting oil like avocado oil or coconut oil in place of butter.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a different type of milk?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can use any type of milk you prefer, whether it’s dairy or non-dairy. Almond milk, soy milk, and oat milk are all great options.</p>
