    <h2>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2>
    <p>To make crock pot gluten-free mac and cheese, you’ll need the following ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup milk (any variety)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to make your crock pot gluten-free mac and cheese:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong> Boil the gluten-free elbow macaroni according to the package instructions until it’s al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crock Pot:</strong> Grease the inside of your crock pot with a little butter or cooking spray to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Ingredients:</strong> In the crock pot, combine the cooked pasta, cheddar cheese, mozzarella cheese, heavy cream, milk, Parmesan cheese, butter, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir well to ensure everything is evenly mixed.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook:</strong> Cover the crock pot and cook on low for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent the cheese from sticking to the bottom.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once the cheese is fully melted and the mixture is creamy, your gluten-free mac and cheese is ready to serve. Garnish with additional Parmesan cheese or fresh herbs if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your crock pot gluten-free mac and cheese turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Pasta:</strong> Not all gluten-free pastas are created equal. Look for brands that hold their shape well during cooking, such as those made from brown rice or quinoa.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can become mushy if overcooked. Be sure to cook it al dente before adding it to the crock pot.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Freshly Shredded Cheese:</strong> Pre-shredded cheese often contains anti-caking agents that can affect the texture of your dish. For the creamiest results, shred your cheese fresh.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir Occasionally:</strong> Stirring the mixture occasionally while it cooks will help prevent the cheese from sticking to the bottom of the crock pot and ensure even cooking.</li>
    </ul>
