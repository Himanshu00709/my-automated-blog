    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free Marry Me Chicken:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong> Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong> Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 5-6 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Sauce:</strong> In the same skillet, add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant. Add the sun-dried tomatoes, heavy cream, chicken broth, and Italian seasoning. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer:</strong> Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese until melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Return the Chicken:</strong> Add the chicken breasts back to the skillet, spooning the sauce over them. Let the chicken simmer in the sauce for another 5-7 minutes, or until fully cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Garnish with fresh basil if desired, and serve hot with your favorite gluten-free side dishes.</li>
