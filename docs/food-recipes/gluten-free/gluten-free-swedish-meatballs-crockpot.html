    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Meatballs</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, ground pork, gluten-free breadcrumbs, egg, chopped onion, minced garlic, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, and allspice. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed. Shape the mixture into small meatballs, about 1 inch in diameter. You should have around 20-25 meatballs.</p>

    <h3>2. Brown the Meatballs</h3>
    <p>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add a small amount of oil. Brown the meatballs on all sides, working in batches if necessary. This step is crucial as it helps to lock in the flavors and gives the meatballs a nice texture. Once browned, transfer the meatballs to your crockpot.</p>

    <h3>3. Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the gluten-free flour and whisk it into the remaining fat. Gradually pour in the beef broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it thicken slightly. Add the heavy cream and stir until the sauce is smooth and creamy.</p>

    <h3>4. Cook in the Crockpot</h3>
    <p>Pour the sauce over the meatballs in the crockpot. Cover and cook on low for 4-6 hours or on high for 2-3 hours. The longer cooking time allows the flavors to meld together, resulting in tender, juicy meatballs and a rich, creamy sauce.</p>

    <h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the meatballs are cooked through and the sauce has thickened, serve them over mashed potatoes, gluten-free pasta, or rice. For an authentic Swedish touch, add a dollop of lingonberry jam on the side. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use only ground beef instead of a mix of beef and pork?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use only ground beef if you prefer. However, the combination of beef and pork adds a richer flavor and a more tender texture to the meatballs.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free breadcrumbs, you can use almond flour, crushed gluten-free crackers, or even cooked quinoa as a substitute.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the heavy cream with a dairy-free alternative like coconut cream or almond milk. Just make sure to adjust the seasoning as needed.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze the meatballs and sauce for up to 3 months. Reheat gently on the stove or in the microwave.</p>

With simple substitutions and a slow cooker, you can create a meal that’s both comforting and suitable for those with gluten sensitivities.
