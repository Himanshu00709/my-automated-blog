    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Ground Beef</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Drain any excess fat and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Gluten-Free Pasta</h3>
    <p>Cook the gluten-free pasta according to the package instructions. Be sure not to overcook it, as it will continue to cook in the sauce later. Drain and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet used for the beef, add the gluten-free flour and stir to combine with the remaining fat. Gradually whisk in the milk and broth, ensuring there are no lumps. Add the tomato paste, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir until the sauce thickens.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Everything</h3>
    <p>Add the cooked ground beef and pasta to the skillet with the sauce. Stir in the shredded cheddar cheese until melted and well combined. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to let the flavors meld.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve your homemade gluten-free Hamburger Helper hot, garnished with fresh herbs or extra cheese if desired. Pair it with a side salad or steamed vegetables for a complete meal.</p>
