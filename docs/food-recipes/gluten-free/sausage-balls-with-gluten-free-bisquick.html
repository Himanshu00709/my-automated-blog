They are typically baked until golden brown and served warm.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your sausage balls will bake evenly and achieve that perfect golden-brown color.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Combine the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free Bisquick, ground sausage, shredded cheddar cheese, milk, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix everything together until well combined. The mixture should be slightly sticky but hold together when rolled into balls.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Form the Sausage Balls</h3>
    <p>Using your hands or a small cookie scoop, form the mixture into 1-inch balls. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat, spacing them about 1 inch apart.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Sausage Balls</h3>
    <p>Bake the sausage balls in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. You can check for doneness by cutting one open to ensure there's no pink in the center.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the sausage balls are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving. They are best enjoyed warm, but they can also be stored and reheated later.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Sausage Balls</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh sausage and cheese will yield the best flavor. Avoid pre-shredded cheese, as it often contains anti-caking agents that can affect the texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can make the sausage balls tough. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add other seasonings or spices to the mix, such as smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, or even a bit of hot sauce for a spicy kick.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> You can prepare the sausage balls ahead of time and refrigerate them until you're ready to bake. This is a great time-saver for parties or busy mornings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Sausage Balls</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I Freeze Sausage Balls?</h3>
        <p>Yes, sausage balls freeze very well. After baking, let them cool completely, then place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze. Once frozen, transfer them to a zip-top bag or airtight container. They can be reheated in the oven or microwave.</p>

        <h3>Can I Use a Different Type of Cheese?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While cheddar cheese is traditional, you can experiment with other types of cheese, such as pepper jack, mozzarella, or even a blend of cheeses for a unique flavor profile.</p>

        <h3>What Can I Serve with Sausage Balls?</h3>
        <p>Sausage balls are versatile and can be served with a variety of dips, such as ranch dressing, marinara sauce, or even a spicy mustard. They also pair well with fresh vegetables or a simple salad for a more complete meal.</p>

        <h3>Can I Make These Dairy-Free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make dairy-free sausage balls by using a dairy-free cheese alternative and a non-dairy milk, such as almond or oat milk. Just be sure to check that all your ingredients are gluten-free and dairy-free.</p>
