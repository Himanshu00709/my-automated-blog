    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Pumpkin Filling</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, granulated sugar, eggs, evaporated milk, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt. Whisk the ingredients together until smooth and well combined. Pour the mixture into a greased 9x13-inch baking dish, spreading it evenly.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Crisp Topping</h3>

    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free oats, gluten-free flour blend, and brown sugar. Add the melted butter and stir until the mixture is crumbly and well combined. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the pumpkin filling, covering it completely.</p>

    <h3>3. Bake to Perfection</h3>

    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the filling is set. You can test the doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center; it should come out clean when the crisp is ready.</p>

    <h3>4. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Allow the pumpkin crisp to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. This dessert is best enjoyed warm, and you can top it with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra treat.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pumpkin Crisp</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin puree?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh pumpkin puree if you prefer. Simply roast a sugar pumpkin, remove the skin, and blend the flesh until smooth. Make sure to drain any excess liquid to achieve the right consistency.</p>

        <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>A 1:1 gluten-free flour blend, such as those from brands like Bob's Red Mill or King Arthur, works well in this recipe. These blends are designed to mimic the texture of all-purpose flour and provide excellent results in baking.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the evaporated milk with a dairy-free alternative like coconut milk or almond milk. For the butter, use a dairy-free margarine or coconut oil.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftover pumpkin crisp?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat individual servings in the microwave or oven before serving.</p>
