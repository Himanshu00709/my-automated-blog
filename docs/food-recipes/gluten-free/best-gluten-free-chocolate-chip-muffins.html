    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free chocolate chip muffins:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with butter or cooking spray.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. Ensure that these ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in your batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream together the unsalted butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for creating a tender crumb in your muffins.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined; overmixing can lead to dense muffins.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in Chocolate Chips</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Fill Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Scoop the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full. This allows room for the muffins to rise without overflowing.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the muffins in the preheated oven for 18-22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The tops should be golden brown and slightly springy to the touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy warm or at room temperature!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Muffins</h2>

    <p>Here are some additional tips to ensure your gluten-free chocolate chip muffins turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Ensure that your butter, eggs, and milk are at room temperature before mixing. This helps create a smoother batter and more even baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to tough muffins. Mix until just combined to keep the texture light and tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flours:</strong> Different gluten-free flour blends can yield slightly different results. Experiment with a few to find your favorite.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Mix-Ins:</strong> Feel free to customize your muffins by adding nuts, dried fruit, or even a swirl of peanut butter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Muffins</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour can be used, but it will result in a denser, more moist muffin. For a lighter texture, it's best to use a gluten-free flour blend that includes a mix of flours and starches.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Simply substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a non-dairy milk such as almond, soy, or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Dark chocolate chips will give your muffins a richer, more intense chocolate flavor. Feel free to use your favorite type of chocolate chips.</p>
    </div>
