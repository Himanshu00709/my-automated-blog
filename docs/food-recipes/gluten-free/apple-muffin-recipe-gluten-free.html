    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the process of making these delightful gluten-free apple muffins.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, ground cinnamon, and salt. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream together the unsalted butter (or coconut oil) and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with the unsweetened applesauce and milk. Mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fold in Apples</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the diced apples, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Apple Muffins</h2>
    <p>Here are some expert tips to ensure your gluten-free apple muffins turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a reliable gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that’s specifically designed for baking to achieve the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough muffins. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add nuts or raisins:</strong> For extra flavor and texture, consider adding chopped nuts or raisins to the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Keep the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze them for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like almond flour or oat flour. However, the texture and taste may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with coconut oil and use a non-dairy milk alternative like almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How do I know when the muffins are done?</h3>
        <p>Insert a toothpick into the center of a muffin. If it comes out clean or with a few crumbs, the muffins are done.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other fruits to this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add other fruits like blueberries or bananas. Just make sure to adjust the sweetness accordingly.</p>
