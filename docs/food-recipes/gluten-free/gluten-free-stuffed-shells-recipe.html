    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get cooking! Follow these step-by-step instructions to create a delicious batch of gluten-free stuffed shells.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Pasta Shells</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gluten-free jumbo pasta shells and cook according to the package instructions, usually about 8-10 minutes. Be careful not to overcook them, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy. Once cooked, drain the shells and set them aside to cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, egg, chopped parsley, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated. This creamy, cheesy filling is the heart of your stuffed shells.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Stuff the Shells</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Take each cooked pasta shell and carefully spoon the cheese mixture into the shell, filling it generously. Place each stuffed shell into a baking dish that has been lightly greased with olive oil. Continue until all the shells are filled and arranged in the dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Sauce</h3>
    <p>Pour the marinara sauce evenly over the stuffed shells, making sure each one is covered. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese on top for an extra layer of cheesy goodness.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown. Let the dish cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Stuffed Shells</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this recipe dairy-free by substituting the ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses with dairy-free alternatives. Look for plant-based cheeses that melt well and have a similar texture to traditional cheese.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free stuffed shells?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Gluten-free stuffed shells freeze well. After assembling the dish, cover it tightly with plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. When you're ready to eat, bake it directly from frozen, adding an extra 10-15 minutes to the cooking time.</p>

        <h3>What can I serve with gluten-free stuffed shells?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free stuffed shells pair well with a fresh green salad, garlic bread (gluten-free, of course), or steamed vegetables. A glass of red wine or sparkling water with lemon also complements the dish nicely.</p>
