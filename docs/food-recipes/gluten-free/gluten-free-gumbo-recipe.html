<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Roux</h3>

<p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil or butter over medium heat. Add the gluten-free flour and stir continuously to create a roux. Cook the roux until it reaches a dark brown color, which should take about 15-20 minutes. Be careful not to burn it, as this will affect the flavor of your gumbo.</p>

<h3>2. Sauté the Vegetables</h3>

<p>Once the roux is ready, add the chopped onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic to the pot. Sauté the vegetables until they are softened, about 5-7 minutes.</p>

<h3>3. Add the Protein</h3>

<p>Next, add the sliced Andouille sausage and chicken thighs to the pot. Cook until the sausage is browned and the chicken is no longer pink, about 5-7 minutes.</p>

<h3>4. Incorporate the Broth and Seasonings</h3>

<p>Pour in the gluten-free chicken broth, followed by the sliced okra, diced tomatoes, bay leaves, thyme, oregano, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Stir everything together and bring the mixture to a boil.</p>

<h3>5. Simmer the Gumbo</h3>

<p>Reduce the heat to low and let the gumbo simmer for at least 1 hour, stirring occasionally. The longer it simmers, the more the flavors will meld together. If the gumbo becomes too thick, you can add more broth or water as needed.</p>

<h3>6. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Once the gumbo is ready, remove the bay leaves and serve it over cooked rice. Garnish with chopped green onions or parsley if desired.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Gumbo</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour for the roux?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour that you prefer. Rice flour, almond flour, and even chickpea flour are all good options. Just keep in mind that different flours may slightly alter the texture and flavor of the roux.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this gumbo vegetarian or vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the chicken and sausage with plant-based proteins like tofu, tempeh, or seitan. Use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and ensure that all other ingredients are vegan-friendly.</p>

    <h3>How long can I store leftover gumbo?</h3>
    <p>Leftover gumbo can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months. Just be sure to reheat it thoroughly before serving.</p>

    <h3>What can I serve with gluten-free gumbo?</h3>
    <p>Gumbo is traditionally served over rice, but you can also enjoy it with gluten-free cornbread, a side salad, or even on its own as a hearty stew.</p>
