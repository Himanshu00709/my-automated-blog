    <h1>Gluten-Free Liquorice Recipe: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>Liquorice, with its unique sweet and slightly tangy flavor, has been a beloved treat for centuries. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding gluten-free liquorice can be a challenge.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Gelatin or Agar-Agar</h3>

    <p>In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin or agar-agar over 1/2 cup of water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes to bloom. If you’re using gelatin, you may need to heat the mixture slightly to dissolve it completely. For agar-agar, bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for a few minutes until fully dissolved.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>

    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free flour and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of the salt. This will help enhance the flavor of your liquorice.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>

    <p>In a saucepan, combine the molasses, honey or maple syrup, and liquorice extract. Heat the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly until it becomes smooth and well combined. If you’re using food coloring, add it at this stage and mix thoroughly.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine All Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Gradually add the gelatin or agar-agar mixture to the saucepan, stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Once combined, slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until a thick dough forms. The dough should be pliable but not sticky.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Shape the Liquorice</h3>

    <p>Roll the dough into small logs or use a liquorice mold to create your desired shapes. If you’re rolling the dough by hand, you can cut it into small pieces with a knife or kitchen scissors. Place the shaped liquorice on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Let It Set</h3>

    <p>Allow the liquorice to set at room temperature for at least 2 hours, or until it becomes firm. For a quicker setting time, you can place the liquorice in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Enjoy!</h3>

    <p>Once the liquorice has set, it’s ready to enjoy! Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Liquorice</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour of your choice, such as almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Just ensure that the flour you choose is certified gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe vegan-friendly?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this recipe vegan by using agar-agar instead of gelatin. Agar-agar is a plant-based alternative that works well as a gelling agent.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other flavors to the liquorice?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can experiment with different extracts, such as vanilla, mint, or even citrus, to create unique flavor combinations. Just be sure to adjust the quantities to suit your taste.</p>

        <h3>How long does homemade liquorice last?</h3>
        <p>Homemade liquorice can last up to a week when stored in an airtight container at room temperature. For longer storage, you can keep it in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.</p>
