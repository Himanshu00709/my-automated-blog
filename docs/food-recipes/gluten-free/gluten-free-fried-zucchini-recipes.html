    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Zucchini</h3>
    <p>Start by washing the zucchini thoroughly and patting them dry with a paper towel. Slice the zucchini into 1/4-inch thick rounds or lengthwise strips, depending on your preference. Sprinkle the slices with a little salt and let them sit for about 10 minutes to draw out excess moisture. This step is crucial for achieving a crispy texture.</p>

    <h3>2. Set Up Your Breading Station</h3>
    <p>In three separate shallow bowls, place the gluten-free flour, beaten eggs, and gluten-free breadcrumbs. If you’re using Parmesan cheese, mix it into the breadcrumbs for added flavor. This setup will allow you to coat the zucchini slices evenly.</p>

    <h3>3. Coat the Zucchini</h3>
    <p>Dip each zucchini slice first into the gluten-free flour, shaking off any excess. Next, dip it into the beaten eggs, ensuring it’s fully coated. Finally, press the zucchini into the breadcrumb mixture, making sure it’s evenly covered on both sides. Place the coated slices on a plate or baking sheet.</p>

    <h3>4. Fry the Zucchini</h3>
    <p>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the zucchini slices in a single layer, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry each side for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the fried zucchini to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</p>

    <h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve the gluten-free fried zucchini immediately while they’re still warm and crispy. They pair wonderfully with a dipping sauce like marinara, ranch, or a simple garlic aioli. Enjoy as an appetizer, side dish, or even a light main course!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Fried Zucchini</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Zucchini:</strong> Fresh zucchini will yield the best results. Avoid zucchini that’s too soft or has blemishes.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Salting Step:</strong> Salting the zucchini helps remove excess moisture, which is key to achieving a crispy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Oil:</strong> Use an oil with a high smoke point, such as olive oil or avocado oil, for frying.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcrowd the Pan:</strong> Frying too many slices at once can lower the oil temperature, resulting in soggy zucchini.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Seasonings:</strong> Add herbs and spices like paprika, garlic powder, or Italian seasoning to the breadcrumbs for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fried Zucchini</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I bake the zucchini instead of frying?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake the zucchini for a healthier alternative. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and place the breaded zucchini slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Lightly spray or brush the slices with oil and bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden and crispy.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free breadcrumbs, you can use crushed gluten-free crackers, cornmeal, or even ground nuts like almonds or pecans for a different texture and flavor.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make this recipe vegan, replace the eggs with a plant-based alternative like flaxseed meal mixed with water or a commercial egg replacer. Use vegan Parmesan cheese or omit it entirely.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover fried zucchini?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover fried zucchini in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat them in the oven or toaster oven to maintain their crispiness.</p>
