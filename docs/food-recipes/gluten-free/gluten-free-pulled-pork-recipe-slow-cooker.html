    <h1>Gluten-Free Pulled Pork Recipe for Slow Cooker</h1>
    <p>Pulled pork is a classic comfort food that’s perfect for family dinners, gatherings, or meal prepping. But if you’re following a gluten-free diet, finding recipes that fit your needs can be a challenge. The good news is that making gluten-free pulled pork in a slow cooker is not only easy but also incredibly flavorful. This recipe ensures that you can enjoy tender, juicy pulled pork without worrying about gluten. Let’s dive into the details!</p>

    <h2>Why Choose a Slow Cooker for Pulled Pork?</h2>
    <p>Slow cookers are a game-changer when it comes to preparing pulled pork. The low and slow cooking method allows the pork to become incredibly tender, as the connective tissues break down over time. This results in meat that practically falls apart with a fork. Additionally, using a slow cooker means you can set it and forget it, making it a convenient option for busy days.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pork</h3>
    <p>Start by trimming any excess fat from the pork shoulder. While some fat is necessary for flavor and moisture, too much can make the dish greasy. Pat the pork dry with paper towels and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Rub</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Rub this mixture evenly over the entire surface of the pork. This step is crucial for building layers of flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Sear the Pork (Optional)</h3>
    <p>For an extra layer of flavor, you can sear the pork in a hot skillet before placing it in the slow cooker. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and sear the pork on all sides until it’s browned. This step is optional but highly recommended.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble in the Slow Cooker</h3>
    <p>Place the pork in the slow cooker. In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free BBQ sauce, apple cider vinegar, and broth. Pour this mixture over the pork, ensuring it’s evenly coated. Cover the slow cooker and set it to cook on low for 8-10 hours or on high for 5-6 hours.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Shred the Pork</h3>
    <p>Once the pork is cooked and tender, remove it from the slow cooker and place it on a cutting board. Use two forks to shred the meat. Return the shredded pork to the slow cooker and mix it with the cooking liquid. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes to absorb the flavors.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve the pulled pork on gluten-free buns, over rice, or with your favorite sides. It pairs wonderfully with coleslaw, pickles, or a fresh salad.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different cut of pork?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use pork loin or tenderloin, but keep in mind that these cuts are leaner and may not be as tender as pork shoulder or butt. Adjust the cooking time accordingly.</p>

        <h3>How do I know if my BBQ sauce is gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Always check the label for gluten-free certification or ingredients like wheat, barley, or rye. Many brands now offer gluten-free options, but it’s essential to verify.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Pulled pork reheats well and can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 3 months. Reheat it in the microwave or on the stovetop with a splash of broth to keep it moist.</p>

        <h3>What sides go well with gluten-free pulled pork?</h3>
        <p>Great options include gluten-free cornbread, roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh green salad. Coleslaw is also a classic pairing.</p>

The slow cooker does all the heavy lifting, making it an easy and convenient dish for any occasion. Whether you’re serving it at a family dinner or a casual gathering, this pulled pork is sure to be a hit. Give it a try and savor the delicious, gluten-free flavors!</p>
