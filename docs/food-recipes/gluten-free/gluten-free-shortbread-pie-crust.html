    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free shortbread pie crust is simpler than you might think. Follow these steps for a perfect crust every time:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> Ensure all ingredients are measured and ready. The butter should be cold, as this helps create a flaky texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut in the Butter:</strong> Add the cold butter to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Vanilla Extract:</strong> Drizzle the vanilla extract over the mixture and gently mix until the dough begins to come together.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Dough:</strong> Press the dough into a 9-inch pie dish, ensuring it is evenly distributed. Use the back of a spoon or your fingers to smooth the surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Crust:</strong> Place the crust in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to firm up. This step is crucial for preventing the crust from shrinking during baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Bake (Optional):</strong> If your recipe calls for a pre-baked crust, bake at 350°F (175°C) for 10-12 minutes, or until lightly golden. Allow to cool before adding your filling.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free shortbread pie crust turns out perfectly, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as these often contain a mix of flours and starches that mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep Ingredients Cold:</strong> Cold butter is essential for achieving a flaky texture. If the butter becomes too soft, the crust may become dense.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overwork the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a tough crust. Mix just until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill Before Baking:</strong> Chilling the dough helps prevent shrinkage and ensures the crust holds its shape during baking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of sugar?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute granulated sugar with other types of sugar, such as coconut sugar or powdered sugar. However, keep in mind that this may slightly alter the texture and flavor of the crust.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the crust ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! The crust can be prepared and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days before baking. You can also freeze the unbaked crust for up to 3 months. Just be sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap to prevent freezer burn.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of butter?</h3>
        <p>If you need a dairy-free option, you can substitute the butter with a plant-based alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter. Keep in mind that this may change the flavor and texture of the crust.</p>

        <h3>Can I use this crust for savory pies?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this crust works well for both sweet and savory pies. Simply omit the sugar and add a pinch of herbs or spices to complement your filling.</p>
    </div>
