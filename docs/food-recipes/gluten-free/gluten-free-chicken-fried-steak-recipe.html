<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Breading Station</h3>

<p>To begin, set up a breading station with three shallow dishes. In the first dish, place the gluten-free all-purpose flour. In the second dish, whisk together the eggs and milk. In the third dish, combine the gluten-free breadcrumbs with the salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. This will ensure that your steak is evenly coated and flavorful.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Coat the Steak</h3>

<p>Take each piece of steak and first dredge it in the gluten-free flour, shaking off any excess. Next, dip the steak into the egg mixture, allowing any excess to drip off. Finally, press the steak into the breadcrumb mixture, ensuring it is fully coated on both sides. Place the coated steak on a plate and repeat the process with the remaining pieces.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Heat the Oil</h3>

<p>In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. You want the oil to be hot but not smoking, as this will ensure a crispy exterior without burning the breading. To test if the oil is ready, you can drop a small piece of breadcrumb into the oil; if it sizzles and rises to the surface, the oil is ready.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Fry the Steak</h3>

<p>Carefully place the coated steak into the hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd the skillet. Fry each piece for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Once done, transfer the steak to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Serve your gluten-free chicken fried steak hot, accompanied by your favorite sides such as mashed potatoes, green beans, or a fresh salad. For an extra touch, you can also make a gluten-free gravy to drizzle over the top.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Chicken Fried Steak</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a meat mallet:</strong> If you're using round steak instead of cube steak, tenderize the meat with a meat mallet to ensure it's tender and easy to eat.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't skip the seasoning:</strong> The breadcrumb mixture is where most of the flavor comes from, so don't be shy with the spices.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep the oil temperature consistent:</strong> If the oil is too hot, the breading will burn before the steak is cooked through. If it's too cool, the breading will absorb too much oil and become greasy.</li>
    <li><strong>Make it ahead:</strong> You can prepare the breaded steak ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator until you're ready to fry it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours such as almond flour or coconut flour, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>Can I bake the steak instead of frying it?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can bake the steak in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through. However, the texture may not be as crispy as when fried.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of breadcrumbs?</h3>
    <p>If you don't have gluten-free breadcrumbs, you can use crushed gluten-free crackers or even gluten-free cornflakes as a substitute.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use a dairy-free milk alternative such as almond milk or oat milk in place of regular milk.</p>
</div>
