<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Taco Seasoning</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Is this taco seasoning really gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, this taco seasoning is gluten-free as long as you use spices that are certified gluten-free. Always check the labels of pre-packaged spices to ensure they haven’t been processed in facilities that handle gluten.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I adjust the spice level?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! If you prefer a milder seasoning, reduce the amount of crushed red pepper flakes or omit them entirely. For a spicier blend, increase the amount of chili powder or add a pinch of cayenne pepper.</p>

    <h3>3. How long does homemade taco seasoning last?</h3>
    <p>When stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place, homemade taco seasoning can last up to six months. However, for the best flavor, it’s recommended to use it within three months.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I use fresh garlic and onion instead of powder?</h3>
    <p>While fresh garlic and onion can add great flavor to your dishes, they won’t work as well in a dry seasoning blend. The powders are used here to ensure an even distribution of flavor and a longer shelf life.</p>

    <h3>5. Is this seasoning suitable for other cuisines?</h3>
    <p>While this blend is specifically designed for tacos, it can also be used in other Mexican-inspired dishes like enchiladas, burritos, or fajitas. Feel free to experiment!</p>
