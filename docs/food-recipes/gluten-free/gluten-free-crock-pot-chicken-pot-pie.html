    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken and Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Start by placing the boneless, skinless chicken breasts at the bottom of your crock pot. Add the diced potatoes, frozen mixed vegetables, diced onion, and minced garlic on top. These ingredients will form the base of your pot pie filling.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Create the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free chicken broth and gluten-free all-purpose flour until smooth. This mixture will act as a thickening agent for your pot pie filling. Pour the mixture over the chicken and vegetables in the crock pot.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook on Low Heat</h3>
    <p>Set your crock pot to low heat and cook for 6-8 hours. This slow cooking process allows the flavors to meld together and the chicken to become tender and easy to shred.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Shred the Chicken and Add Cream</h3>
    <p>Once the cooking time is up, remove the chicken breasts and shred them using two forks. Return the shredded chicken to the crock pot and stir in the heavy cream or coconut milk. This will give your filling a rich and creamy texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Prepare the Gluten-Free Pie Crust</h3>
    <p>While the filling is finishing up, roll out your gluten-free pie crust and cut it into strips or shapes to create a lattice top. Alternatively, you can place the entire sheet over the filling for a traditional pot pie look.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Transfer the filling to a baking dish and top it with the gluten-free pie crust. Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Crock Pot Chicken Pot Pie</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh vegetables instead of frozen?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Fresh vegetables work just as well in this recipe. Simply chop them into bite-sized pieces and add them to the crock pot along with the chicken.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of heavy cream?</h3>
        <p>If you’re looking for a dairy-free alternative, coconut milk is an excellent substitute. It adds a subtle sweetness and creaminess to the dish.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the filling in advance and store it in the refrigerator for up to two days. When you’re ready to serve, simply reheat the filling, top it with the gluten-free pie crust, and bake as directed.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for freezing?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this gluten-free crock pot chicken pot pie freezes well. Store the baked pie in an airtight container and freeze for up to three months. To reheat, thaw in the refrigerator overnight and bake at 350°F (175°C) until heated through.</p>
