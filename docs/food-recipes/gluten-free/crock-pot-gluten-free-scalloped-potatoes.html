    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Start by washing and peeling the potatoes. Slice them thinly (about 1/8 inch thick) using a sharp knife or a mandoline slicer. Uniform slices ensure even cooking. Place the slices in a bowl of cold water to prevent browning while you prepare the sauce.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Gluten-Free Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the gluten-free flour and whisk continuously to create a roux. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the mixture is smooth and slightly golden. Gradually pour in the milk and heavy cream, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Add the minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Continue cooking until the sauce thickens, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese until melted.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Layer the Potatoes and Sauce</h3>
    <p>Drain the potato slices and pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel. In your crock pot, layer the potatoes and sauce alternately. Start with a thin layer of sauce at the bottom, followed by a layer of potatoes, then more sauce, and repeat until all ingredients are used. Finish with a layer of sauce on top and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook in the Crock Pot</h3>
    <p>Cover the crock pot and cook on low heat for 6-7 hours or on high heat for 3-4 hours. The potatoes should be tender, and the sauce should be bubbly and golden brown on top. Garnish with fresh thyme or parsley before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Scalloped Potatoes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use the Right Potatoes:</strong> Yukon Gold or Russet potatoes work best for scalloped potatoes due to their starch content, which helps create a creamy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Roux:</strong> The roux is essential for thickening the sauce. Make sure to cook it long enough to eliminate the raw flour taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer Evenly:</strong> Even layers of potatoes and sauce ensure that every bite is flavorful and well-cooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Insert a fork into the potatoes to check if they’re tender. If not, cook for an additional 30 minutes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a dairy-free alternative for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the milk and heavy cream with almond milk, coconut milk, or any other dairy-free alternative. Use dairy-free cheese for a completely vegan version.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave or oven until warmed through.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other ingredients to this dish?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can add cooked bacon, ham, or sautéed mushrooms for extra flavor. Just layer them with the potatoes and sauce.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe safe for celiac disease?</h3>
        <p>Yes, as long as you use certified gluten-free ingredients, this recipe is safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.</p>
