    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free crockpot mac and cheese:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong> Boil the gluten-free elbow macaroni according to the package instructions, but reduce the cooking time by 1-2 minutes. The pasta will continue to cook in the crockpot, so you want it to be slightly undercooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Sauce:</strong> In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the cream cheese and stir until smooth. Gradually whisk in the milk, ensuring there are no lumps. Add the shredded cheddar cheese, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika (if using). Stir until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine in the Crockpot:</strong> Transfer the cooked pasta to the crockpot. Pour the cheese sauce over the pasta and stir to combine. Cover and cook on low for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Once the mac and cheese is creamy and heated through, serve it hot. Garnish with additional shredded cheese or a sprinkle of paprika if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free crockpot mac and cheese turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Pasta:</strong> Not all gluten-free pastas are created equal. Look for brands that use a blend of rice, corn, and quinoa for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook the Pasta:</strong> Since the pasta will continue to cook in the crockpot, it’s important to slightly undercook it during the boiling stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Freshly Shredded Cheese:</strong> Pre-shredded cheese often contains anti-caking agents that can affect the smoothness of your sauce. Shred your cheese fresh for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir Occasionally:</strong> Stirring the mac and cheese occasionally while it cooks in the crockpot will help prevent the pasta from sticking to the bottom and ensure even cooking.</li>
    </ul>
