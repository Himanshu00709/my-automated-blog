<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat Your Oven</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 425°F (220°C). This ensures that your shortcake will bake evenly and rise properly.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Shortcake Dough</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the Bisquick Gluten-Free Mix and granulated sugar. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, melted butter, egg, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense shortcake.</p>

<h3>3. Shape and Bake</h3>

<p>Drop the dough by spoonfuls onto a greased baking sheet, forming six equal portions. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the shortcakes are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>4. Assemble the Shortcakes</h3>

<p>Once the shortcakes have cooled slightly, slice them in half horizontally. Place the bottom half on a plate, top with a generous amount of sliced strawberries and whipped cream, and then place the top half of the shortcake over the filling. Serve immediately and enjoy!</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Shortcakes</h2>

<p>Here are some tips to ensure your Bisquick Gluten-Free Shortcakes turn out perfectly every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh strawberries and high-quality whipped cream will make a significant difference in the flavor of your shortcakes.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough shortcakes. Mix until just combined for the best texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> While strawberries and whipped cream are classic, feel free to experiment with other fruits and toppings like blueberries, peaches, or even a drizzle of chocolate sauce.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour mix?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use a different gluten-free flour mix, but the texture and taste may vary slightly. Bisquick Gluten-Free Mix is specifically formulated to mimic the texture of traditional Bisquick, so it’s recommended for this recipe.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the milk with a non-dairy alternative like almond milk or oat milk, and use a dairy-free butter substitute. For the whipped cream, there are many non-dairy options available, such as coconut whipped cream.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftover shortcakes?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover shortcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two days. If you’ve already assembled the shortcakes with strawberries and whipped cream, it’s best to store them in the refrigerator and consume them within 24 hours.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze the shortcakes?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the shortcakes before adding the toppings. Wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe bag. They can be frozen for up to three months. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>
