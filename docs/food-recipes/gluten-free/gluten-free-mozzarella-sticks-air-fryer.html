    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Coating Station</h3>

    <p>Set up a coating station with three shallow bowls. In the first bowl, place the gluten-free all-purpose flour. In the second bowl, beat the eggs. In the third bowl, combine the gluten-free breadcrumbs, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.</p>

    <h3>2. Coat the Mozzarella Sticks</h3>

    <p>Take one mozzarella stick and coat it evenly in the flour, shaking off any excess. Next, dip it into the beaten eggs, ensuring it’s fully coated. Finally, roll it in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to adhere the crumbs to the cheese. Repeat this process for all the mozzarella sticks.</p>

    <h3>3. Freeze the Coated Sticks</h3>

    <p>Place the coated mozzarella sticks on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Freeze them for at least 30 minutes. This step is crucial as it helps the coating stick to the cheese and prevents it from melting too quickly in the air fryer.</p>

    <h3>4. Preheat the Air Fryer</h3>

    <p>Preheat your air fryer to 400°F (200°C) for about 5 minutes. This ensures that the mozzarella sticks cook evenly and become crispy.</p>

    <h3>5. Cook the Mozzarella Sticks</h3>

    <p>Lightly spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Place the frozen mozzarella sticks in the basket in a single layer, making sure they don’t touch each other. Cook for 6-8 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy. Be sure to check them halfway through to ensure they’re cooking evenly.</p>

    <h3>6. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once the mozzarella sticks are done, remove them from the air fryer and let them cool for a minute or two. Serve them with your favorite gluten-free marinara sauce or dipping sauce of choice. Enjoy your crispy, cheesy gluten-free mozzarella sticks!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Mozzarella Sticks</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Cheese:</strong> Opt for high-quality mozzarella sticks that are specifically labeled as gluten-free to avoid any cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Freezing Step:</strong> Freezing the coated mozzarella sticks helps the breading adhere better and prevents the cheese from oozing out during cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Overcrowding:</strong> Make sure to cook the mozzarella sticks in a single layer without overcrowding the air fryer basket. This ensures even cooking and crispiness.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Seasonings:</strong> Feel free to customize the breadcrumb mixture with your favorite herbs and spices to suit your taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular breadcrumbs instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>No, regular breadcrumbs contain gluten, which is not suitable for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Always use gluten-free breadcrumbs to ensure the recipe remains gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these mozzarella sticks ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the mozzarella sticks up to the freezing step and store them in the freezer for up to a month. When you’re ready to cook, simply air fry them straight from the freezer.</p>

        <h3>What dipping sauces pair well with gluten-free mozzarella sticks?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free marinara sauce is a classic choice, but you can also try ranch dressing, garlic aioli, or even a spicy sriracha mayo. Just make sure the sauces are gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>Can I bake these mozzarella sticks instead of using an air fryer?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake them in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown. However, the air fryer provides a crispier texture with less oil.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free mozzarella sticks made in the air fryer are a delicious and healthier alternative to the traditional deep-fried version. With the right ingredients and a few simple steps, you can enjoy this crispy, cheesy snack without worrying about gluten. Whether you’re hosting a party, looking for a quick snack, or simply craving something indulgent, these gluten-free mozzarella sticks are sure to satisfy. So, fire up your air fryer and get ready to enjoy a guilt-free treat that everyone can enjoy!</p>
