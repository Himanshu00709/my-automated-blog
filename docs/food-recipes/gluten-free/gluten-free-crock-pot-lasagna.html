    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the steps to make this gluten-free crock pot lasagna:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Meat Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef or turkey over medium heat. Once cooked, drain any excess fat and add the minced garlic. Stir in the marinara sauce, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Cheese Filling</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and half of the shredded mozzarella cheese. Mix well until the ingredients are fully incorporated. This mixture will serve as the creamy layer in your lasagna.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Start by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of your crock pot. Next, place a layer of gluten-free lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. You may need to break the noodles to fit the shape of your crock pot. Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by another layer of meat sauce. Repeat this process until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Cook in the Crock Pot</h3>
    <p>Cover the crock pot and cook on low for 4-6 hours or on high for 2-3 hours. About 30 minutes before the cooking time is up, sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese on top. Cover again and let the cheese melt and bubble.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the lasagna is cooked, let it sit for about 10 minutes before serving. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to slice. Serve with a side salad or garlic bread for a complete meal.</p>
