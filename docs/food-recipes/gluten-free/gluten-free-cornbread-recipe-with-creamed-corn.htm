    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to make your gluten-free cornbread:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and grease an 8-inch square baking pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free cornmeal, gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk and melted butter. Mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Add creamed corn:</strong> Gently fold in the creamed corn until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the cornbread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cornbread</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use fresh ingredients:</strong> Ensure that your baking powder and gluten-free flour are fresh for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to dense cornbread. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a sweeter cornbread, you can increase the sugar to 1/2 cup.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with add-ins:</strong> Feel free to add shredded cheese, jalapeños, or herbs for a savory twist.</li>
    </ul>
