    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to make your gluten-free cornbread:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan or a cast-iron skillet with butter or cooking spray.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free cornmeal, gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk, melted butter, and honey (or sugar). Mix until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. Fold in the creamed corn gently.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan or skillet. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the cornbread to cool for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy it warm with a pat of butter or a drizzle of honey.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cornbread</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use fresh ingredients:</strong> Fresh baking powder and high-quality gluten-free flour can make a big difference in the texture of your cornbread.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense cornbread. Mix until just combined for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a sweeter cornbread, you can increase the amount of honey or sugar to your liking.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with add-ins:</strong> Feel free to add shredded cheese, jalapeños, or herbs to customize your cornbread.</li>
