<h1>Gluten-Free Sourdough Discard Pancakes: A Delicious and Nutritious Breakfast Option</h1>

<p>In recent years, sourdough baking has seen a resurgence in popularity, and for good reason. The tangy flavor, improved digestibility, and nutritional benefits of sourdough make it a favorite among home bakers.

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Follow these simple steps to make your gluten-free sourdough discard pancakes:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Mix the Batter:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the sourdough discard, gluten-free flour, eggs, milk, baking powder, salt, and sweetener (if using). Mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the pancakes dense.</li>
    <li><strong>Rest the Batter:</strong> Let the batter rest for 10-15 minutes. This allows the gluten-free flour to hydrate and the baking powder to activate, resulting in fluffier pancakes.</li>
    <li><strong>Heat the Pan:</strong> Preheat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter or oil to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the Pancakes:</strong> Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as fresh fruit, maple syrup, or a dollop of yogurt.</li>
</ol>
