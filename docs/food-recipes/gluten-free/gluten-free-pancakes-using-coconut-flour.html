    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pancakes Using Coconut Flour</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I substitute coconut flour with another gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Coconut flour is unique in its ability to absorb a lot of liquid, so substituting it with another flour can be tricky. If you want to use almond flour or oat flour, you’ll need to adjust the liquid and egg ratios in the recipe. It’s best to follow a recipe specifically designed for the flour you’re using.</p>

        <h3>2. Are coconut flour pancakes keto-friendly?</h3>
        <p>Yes, coconut flour pancakes can be keto-friendly, especially if you use low-carb sweeteners and toppings. Coconut flour is naturally low in carbs, making it a great option for those following a ketogenic diet.</p>

        <h3>3. Why are my coconut flour pancakes dry?</h3>
        <p>Coconut flour absorbs a lot of moisture, so it’s important to use enough liquid in your batter. If your pancakes turn out dry, try adding a bit more milk or an extra egg to the batter. Letting the batter sit for a few minutes before cooking can also help.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make these pancakes ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a batch of coconut flour pancakes ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to a month. Simply reheat them in a toaster or microwave before serving.</p>
