    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Sweet Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Wash and peel the sweet potatoes, then cut them into chunks. Place the sweet potato chunks in a large pot, cover them with water, and bring to a boil. Cook until the sweet potatoes are tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain the water and return the sweet potatoes to the pot.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mash and Season</h3>
    <p>Using a potato masher or an electric mixer, mash the sweet potatoes until smooth. Add the butter, brown sugar, milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt. Mix until all the ingredients are well combined and the mixture is creamy.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Transfer the sweet potato mixture to a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread it out evenly with a spatula. Sprinkle the mini marshmallows over the top, covering the entire surface of the casserole.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the casserole in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the marshmallows are golden brown and slightly melted. Keep an eye on the casserole during the last few minutes to prevent the marshmallows from burning.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Remove the casserole from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. This dish pairs beautifully with roasted turkey, ham, or any other holiday main course. It’s also delicious on its own as a sweet treat!</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Information</h2>
    <p>Sweet potatoes are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. They are an excellent source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and fiber. This gluten-free casserole is a healthier alternative to traditional versions, especially when made with minimal added sugar and butter. Here’s a breakdown of the nutritional content per serving:</p>
