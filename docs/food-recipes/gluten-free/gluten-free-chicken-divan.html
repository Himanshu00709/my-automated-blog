    <h1>Gluten-Free Chicken Divan: A Delicious and Healthy Comfort Food</h1>
    <p>Chicken Divan is a classic comfort dish that combines tender chicken, creamy sauce, and broccoli, all baked to perfection. Traditionally, this dish includes ingredients that contain gluten, such as flour-based sauces or breadcrumbs. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets, many people are seeking alternatives that allow them to enjoy their favorite meals without compromising their health. In this blog post, we’ll explore how to make a gluten-free version of Chicken Divan that’s just as delicious and satisfying as the original.</p>

    <h2>What is Chicken Divan?</h2>
    <p>Chicken Divan is believed to have originated in the 1950s at the Divan Parisienne Restaurant in New York City.

By making a gluten-free version of Chicken Divan, you can enjoy this classic dish without worrying about the adverse effects of gluten.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free Chicken Divan.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken and Broccoli</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Cook the chicken breasts by boiling, grilling, or baking them until they’re fully cooked. Once cooked, slice the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Steam the broccoli until it’s tender but still crisp. Arrange the chicken and broccoli in a baking dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Gluten-Free Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add gluten-free flour and whisk until it forms a smooth paste. Gradually add milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Once the mixture thickens, add gluten-free cream of chicken soup, mayonnaise, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir until the sauce is smooth and creamy.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the sauce over the chicken and broccoli in the baking dish. Sprinkle shredded cheese and gluten-free breadcrumbs on top. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Remove the dish from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Gluten-free Chicken Divan pairs well with a side of rice or a fresh salad. Enjoy your delicious and healthy comfort food!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chicken Divan</h2>

        <h3>1. Can I use frozen broccoli instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen broccoli. Just make sure to thaw and drain it well before using it in the recipe to avoid excess moisture in the dish.</p>

        <h3>2. What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free breadcrumbs, you can use crushed gluten-free crackers, almond meal, or even grated Parmesan cheese as a topping.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this dish dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a dairy-free version by using dairy-free cheese, almond milk, and a dairy-free cream of chicken soup. Be sure to check all labels to ensure they’re both gluten-free and dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
