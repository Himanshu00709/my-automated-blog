    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your croutons will bake evenly and achieve the perfect crunch.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Bread</h3>
    <p>Cut the gluten-free bread into 1-inch cubes. If the bread is fresh, you may want to let it sit out for a few hours or toast it slightly to dry it out. This helps the croutons become crispier.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Seasonings</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, garlic powder, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to create a flavorful seasoning blend.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Coat the Bread Cubes</h3>
    <p>Place the bread cubes in a large mixing bowl and drizzle the seasoning mixture over them. Toss the cubes gently to ensure they are evenly coated with the oil and spices.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Croutons</h3>
    <p>Spread the coated bread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the croutons are golden brown and crispy. Be sure to stir the croutons halfway through baking to ensure even cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Store</h3>
    <p>Once the croutons are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely. Store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.</p>

    <h2>Variations and Tips</h2>

    <p>One of the best things about making your own croutons is the ability to customize them to your taste. Here are some variations and tips to consider:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Herb Variations:</strong> Experiment with different herbs such as thyme, rosemary, or parsley to create unique flavor profiles.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese Croutons:</strong> Add a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese before baking for a cheesy twist.</li>
        <li><strong>Spicy Croutons:</strong> Add a pinch of cayenne pepper or chili flakes for a spicy kick.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweet Croutons:</strong> For a sweet version, skip the savory spices and instead toss the bread cubes with cinnamon and sugar before baking.</li>
    </ul>
