    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Biscuits</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 425°F (220°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the milk, stirring until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overmix. Roll out the dough on a floured surface and cut into biscuits using a round cutter. Place the biscuits on a baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Chicken Filling</h3>
    <p>While the biscuits are baking, prepare the chicken filling. In a large skillet, sauté the chopped vegetables until tender. Add the shredded chicken and pour in the gluten-free chicken broth. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then stir in the heavy cream (if using). Allow the sauce to thicken slightly, then season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the biscuits are done, split them in half and place the bottom halves on serving plates. Spoon the chicken filling over the biscuits, then top with the other half. Serve immediately and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chicken and Biscuits</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. A gluten-free flour blend that includes xanthan gum is recommended for the best results.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the butter and milk with dairy-free alternatives like vegan butter and almond milk. You can also skip the heavy cream or use a dairy-free cream substitute.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving. Note that the biscuits may lose some of their crispiness when reheated.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for meal prep?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this dish is great for meal prep. You can prepare the chicken filling and biscuits ahead of time and assemble them when ready to eat. Just be sure to store the components separately to maintain the best texture.</p>
