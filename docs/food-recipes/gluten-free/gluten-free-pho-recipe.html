    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Broth</h3>
    <p>Start by roasting the beef bones in the oven at 200°C (400°F) for about 30 minutes until they are browned. This step adds depth to the broth. Meanwhile, char the onion and ginger over an open flame or in a skillet until they are slightly blackened. This enhances their flavor and aroma.</p>

    <h3>2. Simmer the Broth</h3>
    <p>In a large pot, add the roasted bones, charred onion, ginger, star anise, cinnamon stick, and cloves. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for at least 4-6 hours. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface. Add fish sauce and rock sugar to taste.</p>

    <h3>3. Cook the Rice Noodles</h3>
    <p>While the broth is simmering, cook the gluten-free rice noodles according to the package instructions. Rinse them under cold water to prevent sticking and set aside.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Pho</h3>
    <p>Once the broth is ready, strain it to remove the solids. Slice the beef sirloin thinly and place it in serving bowls. Pour the hot broth over the beef to cook it slightly. Add the cooked rice noodles, fresh herbs, bean sprouts, and lime wedges. Serve immediately with chili slices on the side for an extra kick.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Pho</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use high-quality gluten-free fish sauce:</strong> Not all fish sauces are gluten-free, so check the label carefully.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t rush the broth:</strong> The longer you simmer the broth, the more flavorful it will be.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize your toppings:</strong> Add your favorite herbs, vegetables, or proteins to make the dish your own.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pho</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use chicken instead of beef?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Chicken pho is a popular variation. Simply replace the beef bones with chicken bones and use chicken breast or thigh instead of beef sirloin.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I store leftover pho?</h3>
        <p>Store the broth and noodles separately in airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat the broth before serving and add fresh noodles and toppings.</p>

        <h3>3. Is pho broth naturally gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Traditional pho broth is gluten-free, but some recipes may include soy sauce or other gluten-containing ingredients. Always double-check the ingredients to ensure they are gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Use vegetable broth instead of beef or chicken broth, and replace the fish sauce with a gluten-free soy sauce or tamari. Add tofu or mushrooms for protein.</p>
