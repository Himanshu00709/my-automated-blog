    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Cornbread Casserole</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free cornbread casserole:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter or oil to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of gluten-free cornmeal, 1 cup of gluten-free flour blend, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together 2 eggs (or egg substitute), 1 cup of milk (or dairy-free alternative), and 1/4 cup of melted butter (or oil). Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Optional Ingredients</h3>
    <p>If you’re adding vegetables, cheese, or beans, fold them into the batter at this stage. For example, you can add 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, 1 cup of corn kernels, and 1/2 cup of diced bell peppers for extra flavor and texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the casserole to cool for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving. Pair it with a fresh salad or soup for a complete meal.</p>
