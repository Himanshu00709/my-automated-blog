    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free pancake casserole:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your casserole bakes evenly and achieves the perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Pancake Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free pancake mix, milk, eggs, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Whisk until the batter is smooth and free of lumps. If you’re adding fresh berries or nuts, gently fold them into the batter at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Grease the Baking Dish</h3>
    <p>Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with butter or oil to prevent the casserole from sticking. Pour the pancake batter into the dish, spreading it evenly with a spatula.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the casserole is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The baking time may vary depending on your oven, so keep an eye on it to avoid over-baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Let It Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the casserole is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Slice it into squares and serve warm. You can top it with additional maple syrup, fresh berries, or a dollop of whipped cream for extra indulgence.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Pancake Casserole</h2>

    <p>One of the key advantages of a gluten-free pancake casserole is its nutritional profile. By using gluten-free ingredients, you’re avoiding the potential digestive issues associated with gluten. Additionally, this dish can be a great source of protein, fiber, and healthy fats, depending on the ingredients you choose to include.</p>

    <p>For instance, using almond milk instead of regular milk adds a dose of vitamin E and healthy fats, while fresh berries provide antioxidants and vitamins. Eggs contribute to the protein content, making this casserole a well-rounded meal that can keep you full and energized throughout the morning.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this casserole ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the casserole the night before and store it in the refrigerator. Simply bake it in the morning for a fresh, hot breakfast.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of milk?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can use any type of milk you prefer, whether it’s dairy or a dairy-free alternative like almond, soy, or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>Is this casserole suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>To make this casserole vegan, you can substitute the eggs with a flaxseed or chia seed egg and use a plant-based milk. Ensure that your pancake mix is also vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other ingredients to the casserole?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize the casserole with your favorite ingredients. Consider adding chocolate chips, bananas, or even savory options like spinach and cheese.</p>
