<h1>Gluten-Free Salisbury Steak Recipe: A Comfort Food Classic</h1>

<p>When it comes to comfort food, few dishes can rival the hearty and satisfying Salisbury steak. Traditionally made with ground beef, breadcrumbs, and a rich gravy, this dish is a staple in many households. However, for those following a gluten-free diet, the classic recipe can be off-limits due to the presence of gluten in breadcrumbs and certain gravy thickeners. But fear not! With a few simple substitutions, you can enjoy a delicious, gluten-free Salisbury steak that’s just as comforting and flavorful as the original.</p>

<h2>What is Salisbury Steak?</h2>

<p>Salisbury steak is a dish made from ground beef that’s shaped into patties, seared, and then smothered in a rich onion gravy. It’s often served with mashed potatoes or vegetables, making it a complete and satisfying meal. The dish is named after Dr. James Salisbury, who promoted a meat-centric diet in the 19th century. While the original recipe included breadcrumbs, our gluten-free version uses almond flour and gluten-free breadcrumbs to achieve the same texture and flavor.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Salisbury Steak Patties</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, almond flour, gluten-free breadcrumbs, egg, chopped onion, minced garlic, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper. Mix until all ingredients are well incorporated. Shape the mixture into 4-6 oval-shaped patties, depending on your preferred size.</p>

<h3>2. Cook the Patties</h3>

<p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the patties and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are browned and cooked through. Remove the patties from the skillet and set them aside on a plate.</p>

<h3>3. Prepare the Gravy</h3>

<p>In the same skillet, add the sliced onion and minced garlic. Sauté for about 2-3 minutes until the onions are softened and fragrant. In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and water until smooth. Pour the beef broth into the skillet, followed by the cornstarch mixture. Stir well to combine. Add the Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring constantly, until the gravy thickens.</p>

<h3>4. Combine and Serve</h3>

<p>Return the cooked patties to the skillet, spooning the gravy over them. Reduce the heat to low and let the patties simmer in the gravy for an additional 5 minutes to absorb the flavors. Serve the Salisbury steaks hot, with mashed potatoes or your favorite gluten-free side dish.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour instead of almond flour?</h3>

    <h3>Is Worcestershire sauce always gluten-free?</h3>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the patties and gravy ahead of time and store them separately in the refrigerator. When ready to serve, reheat the patties in the gravy on the stovetop until warmed through.</p>

    <h3>What can I serve with gluten-free Salisbury steak?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free Salisbury steak pairs well with mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or a fresh green salad. You can also serve it over gluten-free pasta or rice.</p>
