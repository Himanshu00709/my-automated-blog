<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Salisbury Steak Patties</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, gluten-free breadcrumbs (or almond flour), egg, chopped onion, minced garlic, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and black pepper. Mix until just combined—avoid overmixing to keep the patties tender. Form the mixture into 4 oval-shaped patties, about 1/2 inch thick.</p>

<h3>2. Cook the Patties</h3>
<p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the patties and cook for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until browned. Remove the patties from the skillet and set aside.</p>

<h3>3. Make the Mushroom Gravy</h3>
<p>In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and chopped onion, cooking until softened and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute. Sprinkle the gluten-free flour over the mixture and stir to combine, cooking for 1-2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.</p>

<p>Gradually whisk in the beef broth and Worcestershire sauce, ensuring there are no lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring constantly, until the gravy thickens. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<h3>4. Combine and Simmer</h3>
<p>Return the cooked patties to the skillet, nestling them into the gravy. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the patties to cook through.</p>

<h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
<p>Serve your gluten-free Salisbury steak with mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, or cauliflower rice for a complete meal. Garnish with fresh parsley for a pop of color and freshness.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Ground turkey or chicken can be used as a leaner alternative to ground beef. Just be sure to adjust the cooking time as needed.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
    <p>Almond flour, crushed gluten-free crackers, or even rolled oats (certified gluten-free) make excellent substitutes for breadcrumbs.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze this dish?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Freeze the cooked patties and gravy in a freezer-safe container for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before reheating.</p>
