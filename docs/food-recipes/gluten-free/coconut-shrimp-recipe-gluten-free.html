    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Coconut Shrimp?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among health-conscious individuals. Traditional coconut shrimp recipes often use wheat flour as a coating, but this version replaces it with gluten-free alternatives, making it accessible to everyone. Plus, the combination of coconut and shrimp is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients like protein, healthy fats, and essential vitamins.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients You'll Need</h2>
    <p>Before diving into the recipe, let's gather all the necessary ingredients. Here's what you'll need to make gluten-free coconut shrimp:</p>
    <table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get cooking! Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free coconut shrimp:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Shrimp</h3>
    <p>Start by patting the shrimp dry with a paper towel. This ensures that the coating will stick better. If your shrimp still have tails, you can leave them on for a more elegant presentation or remove them if you prefer.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Set Up Your Coating Station</h3>
    <p>In three separate bowls, prepare your coating station. In the first bowl, place the gluten-free flour mixed with salt, pepper, and paprika. In the second bowl, beat the eggs. In the third bowl, place the shredded coconut.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Coat the Shrimp</h3>
    <p>Take each shrimp and coat it first in the gluten-free flour mixture, then dip it into the beaten eggs, and finally roll it in the shredded coconut. Make sure each shrimp is evenly coated for the best results.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Fry the Shrimp</h3>
    <p>Heat the coconut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the shrimp in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry each side for about 2-3 minutes or until golden brown. Remove the shrimp and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve your gluten-free coconut shrimp immediately with your favorite dipping sauce. A tangy mango salsa or a sweet chili sauce pairs perfectly with the tropical flavors of the shrimp.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Coconut Shrimp</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I bake the shrimp instead of frying?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake the shrimp for a healthier alternative. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and place the coated shrimp on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 10-12 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the shrimp are golden and cooked through.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of coconut oil?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have coconut oil, you can use other oils with a high smoke point, such as avocado oil or vegetable oil. However, coconut oil adds a subtle coconut flavor that complements the dish.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>While it's best to enjoy coconut shrimp fresh, you can prepare the coated shrimp ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator for up to 2 hours before frying. This can save time if you're hosting a party.</p>
