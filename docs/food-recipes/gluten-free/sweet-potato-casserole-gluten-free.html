    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Sweet Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Wash and peel the sweet potatoes, then cut them into chunks. Boil the sweet potato chunks in a large pot of water until they are tender, which should take about 15-20 minutes. Once cooked, drain the water and mash the sweet potatoes until smooth.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the mashed sweet potatoes with the butter, milk, eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. Mix until all the ingredients are well incorporated. The mixture should be smooth and creamy.</p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the chopped pecans with the gluten-free flour and a bit of brown sugar. This will create a crunchy topping for your casserole. You can also add a pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg for extra flavor.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Transfer the sweet potato mixture into a greased baking dish. Spread the pecan topping evenly over the top. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the casserole is heated through.</p>

    <h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once baked, let the casserole cool for a few minutes before serving. This dish pairs wonderfully with roasted meats, salads, or as a standalone dessert. Enjoy your gluten-free sweet potato casserole!</p>

    <h2>Variations and Tips</h2>

    <p>There are several ways to customize your gluten-free sweet potato casserole to suit your taste preferences:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Add Marshmallows:</strong> For a sweeter twist, add a layer of mini marshmallows on top of the casserole during the last 5 minutes of baking. This will give you that classic marshmallow topping.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Different Nuts:</strong> If you’re not a fan of pecans, you can substitute them with walnuts, almonds, or even a mix of your favorite nuts.</li>
        <li><strong>Spice It Up:</strong> Add a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, or even a dash of cayenne pepper for a unique flavor profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Make It Dairy-Free:</strong> If you’re avoiding dairy, use coconut oil instead of butter and a dairy-free milk alternative.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I make this casserole ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the casserole a day in advance. Simply assemble the dish, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. When you’re ready to bake, let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before placing it in the oven.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>4. Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
