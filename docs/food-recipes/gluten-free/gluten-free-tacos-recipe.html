<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Filling</h3>

<p>Start by heating a large skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef or turkey and cook until browned, breaking it up into small pieces with a spatula. Once the meat is fully cooked, drain any excess fat. Add the gluten-free taco seasoning and a splash of water, stirring to combine. Let the mixture simmer for 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Warm the Taco Shells</h3>

<p>While the meat is simmering, warm your gluten-free taco shells or tortillas. You can do this in the oven, on the stovetop, or in the microwave. If using the oven, preheat it to 350°F (175°C) and wrap the tortillas in foil. Heat them for about 5-10 minutes, or until warm and pliable. If using the stovetop, heat a dry skillet over medium heat and warm each tortilla for about 30 seconds on each side.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble the Tacos</h3>

<p>Once the taco shells are warm, it’s time to assemble your tacos. Start by adding a generous spoonful of the meat mixture to each shell. Top with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, and sliced avocado. If desired, add a sprinkle of shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream or Greek yogurt, and a spoonful of salsa. Finish with a squeeze of fresh lime juice for an extra burst of flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Your gluten-free tacos are now ready to serve! Arrange them on a platter and garnish with additional lime wedges and fresh cilantro if desired. These tacos are perfect for a quick weeknight dinner, a festive gathering, or even a casual lunch. Pair them with a side of gluten-free chips and guacamole for a complete meal.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Tacos</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Are corn tortillas gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, corn tortillas are naturally gluten-free, making them an excellent choice for gluten-free tacos. However, always check the packaging to ensure they haven’t been processed in a facility that handles gluten-containing products.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the ground beef or turkey with a plant-based alternative like crumbled tofu, tempeh, or a store-bought meat substitute. Be sure to use vegan cheese and sour cream if desired.</p>

    <h3>3. How do I store leftover gluten-free tacos?</h3>
    <p>Store the taco filling and toppings separately in airtight containers in the refrigerator. The filling will keep for up to 3 days, while the toppings should be used within 1-2 days. Reheat the filling in a skillet or microwave before assembling fresh tacos.</p>

    <h3>4. What are some gluten-free taco seasoning brands?</h3>
    <p>Some popular gluten-free taco seasoning brands include McCormick, Simply Organic, and Old El Paso. Always check the label to ensure the product is certified gluten-free.</p>
