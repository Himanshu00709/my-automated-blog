<p>Making gluten-free sweetcorn fritters is easier than you might think. Here’s a simple recipe that you can follow:</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>2 cups of sweetcorn kernels (fresh or canned)</li>
    <li>1 cup of chickpea flour (or any gluten-free flour of your choice)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of grated cheese (optional)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of chopped fresh herbs (such as parsley or coriander)</li>

    <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil (for frying)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the sweetcorn, chickpea flour, grated cheese (if using), fresh herbs, baking powder, salt, and black pepper.</li>
