    <h1>Gluten-Free Sloppy Joe Recipe: A Delicious and Healthy Twist</h1>

    <p>If you're looking for a comforting, hearty meal that's both gluten-free and packed with flavor, you've come to the right place. Sloppy Joes are a classic American dish that brings back memories of childhood dinners and family gatherings.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Start by gathering all your ingredients and chopping the onion, garlic, and bell pepper. Having everything prepped and ready to go will make the cooking process much smoother.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Ground Beef</h3>

    <p>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef until it's browned and cooked through. If you're using a leaner meat like turkey, you may need to add a little olive oil to prevent sticking. Once the meat is cooked, drain any excess fat and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>

    <p>In the same skillet, add the chopped onion, garlic, and bell pepper. Sauté until the vegetables are softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes. This step is crucial for building the flavor base of your Sloppy Joes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine the Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Return the cooked ground beef to the skillet with the sautéed vegetables. Add the tomato sauce, tomato paste, gluten-free Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar. Stir everything together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Simmer and Season</h3>

    <p>Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. If you prefer a thicker consistency, let it simmer a bit longer.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once the Sloppy Joe mixture is ready, spoon it onto gluten-free buns or lettuce wraps for a low-carb option. Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious, gluten-free meal!</p>
