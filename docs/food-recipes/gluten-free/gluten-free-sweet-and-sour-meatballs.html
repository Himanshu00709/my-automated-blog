<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Meatballs</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, gluten-free breadcrumbs, egg, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed. Shape the mixture into small meatballs, about 1 inch in diameter, and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through and slightly browned.</p>

<h3>2. Making the Sweet and Sour Sauce</h3>

<p>While the meatballs are baking, you can prepare the sweet and sour sauce. In a medium saucepan, combine the pineapple juice, apple cider vinegar, gluten-free soy sauce, and brown sugar. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with a little water to create a slurry, then add it to the saucepan. Stir continuously until the sauce thickens, which should take about 5 minutes. Once the sauce has reached your desired consistency, remove it from the heat.</p>

<h3>3. Combining the Meatballs and Sauce</h3>

<p>Once the meatballs are done baking, transfer them to a large skillet or frying pan. Add the diced bell peppers and pineapple chunks to the pan, then pour the sweet and sour sauce over the top. Gently stir to coat the meatballs and vegetables evenly with the sauce. Cook over medium heat for an additional 5-10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>

<h3>4. Serving Your Gluten-Free Sweet and Sour Meatballs</h3>

<p>Serve the meatballs hot, garnished with chopped green onions or sesame seeds if desired. They pair wonderfully with steamed rice or quinoa for a complete meal. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! While this recipe calls for ground beef or turkey, you can easily substitute it with ground chicken, pork, or even a plant-based meat alternative. Just make sure to adjust the cooking time accordingly.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
    <p>If you don’t have gluten-free breadcrumbs on hand, you can use almond flour, gluten-free oats, or even crushed gluten-free crackers as a substitute. These alternatives will help bind the meatballs together while keeping them gluten-free.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the meatballs and sauce ahead of time and store them separately in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. When you’re ready to serve, simply reheat the meatballs and sauce together in a skillet until warmed through.</p>

    <h3>Is this recipe suitable for freezing?</h3>
    <p>Yes, gluten-free sweet and sour meatballs freeze well. Place the cooked meatballs and sauce in an airtight container and freeze for up to 3 months. To reheat, thaw in the refrigerator overnight and then warm in a skillet or microwave.</p>
</div>

Whether you’re cooking for someone with gluten intolerance or simply looking to try something new, this recipe is sure to become a favorite.
