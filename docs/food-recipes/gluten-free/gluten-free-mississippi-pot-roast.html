    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Roast</h3>

    <p>Start by seasoning the chuck roast generously with salt and pepper on all sides. This will help to enhance the natural flavors of the meat. If you have time, let the roast sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before cooking to ensure even cooking.</p>

    <h3>2. Assemble the Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Place the seasoned roast in your slow cooker or Instant Pot. Sprinkle the gluten-free ranch seasoning and au jus gravy mix evenly over the top of the roast. Add the butter on top of the seasoning, and then place the pepperoncini peppers around the roast. Pour in a small amount of the pepperoncini brine for added flavor.</p>

    <h3>3. Cook the Roast</h3>

    <p>If using a slow cooker, set it to low and cook for 8 hours, or on high for 4-5 hours. If using an Instant Pot, set it to the “Meat/Stew” setting and cook for 60-90 minutes, depending on the size of the roast. The goal is to cook the roast until it’s tender and easily shreds with a fork.</p>

    <h3>4. Shred and Serve</h3>

    <p>Once the roast is cooked, remove it from the slow cooker or Instant Pot and place it on a cutting board. Use two forks to shred the meat, then return it to the pot to soak up the flavorful juices. Serve the shredded roast with your favorite sides, such as mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or gluten-free bread.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Best Gluten-Free Mississippi Pot Roast</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Cut:</strong> A well-marbled chuck roast is ideal for this recipe, as the fat will render down during cooking, making the meat tender and flavorful.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Labels:</strong> Always double-check the labels on your seasoning mixes to ensure they are certified gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Seasoning:</strong> Feel free to adjust the amount of seasoning and butter to suit your taste preferences. Some people prefer a more peppery flavor, while others like it milder.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Vegetables:</strong> For a complete meal, consider adding carrots, potatoes, or onions to the pot during the last few hours of cooking.</li>
    </ul>
