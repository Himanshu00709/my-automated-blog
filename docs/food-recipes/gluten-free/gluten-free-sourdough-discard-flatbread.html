    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these steps to make your gluten-free sourdough discard flatbread:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free sourdough discard, gluten-free flour blend, water, olive oil, and salt. Mix until a dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour; if it's too dry, add a bit more water.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest the Dough:</strong> Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for 30 minutes. This allows the flour to hydrate and the dough to become easier to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>Divide and Shape:</strong> Divide the dough into equal portions, depending on the size of flatbread you want. Roll each portion into a ball and then flatten it into a disc using your hands or a rolling pin.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Flatbread:</strong> Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Place the flattened dough in the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the flatbread warm with your favorite toppings or use it as a base for wraps, pizzas, or sandwiches.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Sourdough Discard Flatbread</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your flatbread turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Sourdough Discard:</strong> Fresh discard will give your flatbread a better rise and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flours:</strong> Different gluten-free flours can yield different textures and flavors. Try a blend of rice flour, almond flour, and tapioca flour for a balanced result.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overwork the Dough:</strong> Overworking the dough can make it tough. Handle it gently to keep the texture light and airy.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Cooking Time:</strong> Cooking times may vary depending on the thickness of your flatbread. Keep an eye on it to avoid burning.</li>
