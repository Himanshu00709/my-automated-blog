<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Chicken Wings</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). While the oven is heating, rinse the chicken wings under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. This step is crucial for ensuring that the wings crisp up nicely in the oven. Once dry, place the wings in a large mixing bowl.</p>

<h3>2. Creating the Gluten-Free Marinade</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free soy sauce or tamari, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, black pepper, olive oil, honey, and apple cider vinegar. If you like your wings spicy, you can also add gluten-free hot sauce to the mix. Whisk the ingredients together until well combined.</p>

<h3>3. Marinating the Wings</h3>

<p>Pour the marinade over the chicken wings, making sure each wing is evenly coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the wings marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. For best results, you can marinate the wings for up to 4 hours, allowing the flavors to fully penetrate the meat.</p>

<h3>4. Baking the Wings</h3>

<p>After marinating, arrange the wings on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Make sure the wings are spaced out evenly to allow for even cooking. Bake the wings in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, flipping them halfway through to ensure they cook evenly on both sides. The wings should be golden brown and crispy when done.</p>

<h3>5. Serving the Wings</h3>

<p>Once the wings are cooked, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Serve them with your favorite gluten-free dipping sauces, such as ranch or blue cheese dressing, and enjoy!</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chicken Wings</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use frozen chicken wings for this recipe?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen chicken wings, but make sure to thaw them completely before marinating. Thawing ensures that the marinade penetrates the meat properly and that the wings cook evenly.</p>

    <h3>2. Are all soy sauces gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>No, not all soy sauces are gluten-free. Traditional soy sauce is made with wheat, so it’s important to look for gluten-free soy sauce or tamari, which is a gluten-free alternative made from soybeans.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I grill the wings instead of baking them?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Grilling the wings will give them a smoky flavor and a slightly different texture. Just make sure to preheat your grill and cook the wings over medium heat, turning them occasionally to prevent burning.</p>

    <h3>4. How do I know if a hot sauce is gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Most hot sauces are naturally gluten-free, but it’s always a good idea to check the label for any gluten-containing ingredients. Look for hot sauces that are certified gluten-free to be safe.</p>

    <h3>5. Can I make these wings ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the wings ahead of time by marinating them and storing them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before cooking. This can save you time if you’re planning to serve them for a party or gathering.</p>
