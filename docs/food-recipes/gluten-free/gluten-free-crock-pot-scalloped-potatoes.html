    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Start by washing and peeling the potatoes. Slice them thinly, about 1/8-inch thick, using a mandoline slicer or a sharp knife. Even slices ensure even cooking and a uniform texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Gluten-Free Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the gluten-free flour and whisk continuously for 1-2 minutes to create a roux. Gradually pour in the milk and heavy cream, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Add the minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese until melted and smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Layer the Potatoes and Sauce</h3>
    <p>Grease the inside of your crock pot with butter or cooking spray. Layer half of the potato slices at the bottom, followed by half of the cheese sauce. Repeat with the remaining potatoes and sauce. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese on top, along with a dash of paprika for added flavor and color.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook in the Crock Pot</h3>
    <p>Cover the crock pot and cook on low heat for 6-7 hours or on high heat for 3-4 hours. The potatoes should be tender, and the sauce should be bubbly and golden brown on top. Let the dish rest for 10 minutes before serving to allow the sauce to thicken further.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Scalloped Potatoes</h2>
    <p>This dish is not only delicious but also offers several nutritional benefits. Potatoes are a great source of vitamins C and B6, potassium, and fiber. Using gluten-free flour ensures that those with gluten sensitivities can enjoy the dish without discomfort. Additionally, the cheese and milk provide calcium and protein, making this a wholesome side dish or even a main course.</p>
