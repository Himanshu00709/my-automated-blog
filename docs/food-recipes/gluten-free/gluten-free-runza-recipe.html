    <h1>Gluten-Free Runza Recipe: A Delicious Twist on a Classic</h1>
    <p>Runzas, also known as bierocks, are a beloved comfort food originating from Eastern Europe and popularized in the Midwest United States.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum, and salt. Add the yeast mixture, egg, and melted butter. Mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes, then cover it with a damp cloth and let it rise for 1 hour.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is rising, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, sautéing until fragrant. Add the ground beef and cook until browned. Stir in the shredded cabbage, salt, pepper, and paprika. Cook until the cabbage is tender, then remove from heat and let it cool.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Runzas</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball and then flatten it into a circle. Place a generous amount of the filling in the center of each circle, then fold the dough over the filling, sealing the edges. Place the runzas on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Runzas</h3>
    <p>Bake the runzas in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the dough is golden brown. Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough a day in advance. Simply cover it tightly with plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator. When you're ready to use it, let it come to room temperature before rolling it out.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free runzas?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Once baked, let the runzas cool completely, then wrap them individually in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe bag. They can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply bake them in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 15-20 minutes.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of ground beef?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer a different protein, you can substitute ground beef with ground turkey, chicken, or even a plant-based alternative like lentils or crumbled tofu. Adjust the seasoning accordingly to suit your taste.</p>
