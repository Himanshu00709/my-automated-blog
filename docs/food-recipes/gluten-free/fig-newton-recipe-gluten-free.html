    <h1>Gluten-Free Fig Newton Recipe: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>Fig Newtons have been a beloved snack for generations, offering a perfect balance of sweet and chewy flavors. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic treat can be a challenge. Fortunately, with the rise of gluten-free baking, it's now possible to recreate this iconic snack at home. In this blog post, we'll walk you through a detailed gluten-free Fig Newton recipe that is not only delicious but also easy to make. Whether you're a seasoned baker or a beginner, this recipe will guide you step-by-step to create a treat that everyone can enjoy.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Fig Newtons?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals who experience gluten sensitivity or simply want to reduce their gluten intake. Traditional Fig Newtons are made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. By substituting gluten-free flour, you can enjoy the same delightful taste and texture without the adverse effects of gluten. Additionally, making your own Fig Newtons allows you to control the ingredients, ensuring a healthier and more natural snack.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing the Fig Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by preparing the fig filling, which is the heart of your Fig Newtons. In a small saucepan, combine the dried figs, water, and lemon juice. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the figs are soft and the liquid has reduced. Once the figs are soft, transfer the mixture to a food processor and blend until smooth. Set aside to cool.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. The dough should be soft but not sticky. If it's too sticky, you can add a little more gluten-free flour.</p>

    <h3>3. Assembling the Fig Newtons</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide the dough into two equal portions. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one portion of the dough into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread half of the fig filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Carefully roll the dough into a log, starting from one of the longer sides. Repeat with the second portion of dough and filling. Place the logs on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.</p>

    <h3>4. Cooling and Serving</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the Fig Newtons from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes. Transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing into individual cookies. Serve and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh figs instead of dried figs?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh figs, but you may need to adjust the amount of water and cooking time. Fresh figs have a higher moisture content, so you might not need as much water, and they may cook faster.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I substitute almond flour with another type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that different flours have different textures and absorbencies, so you may need to adjust the quantity slightly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store gluten-free Fig Newtons?</h3>
        <p>Store your gluten-free Fig Newtons in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 3 months. Just make sure to thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free Fig Newtons at home is a rewarding experience that allows you to enjoy a classic treat without compromising your dietary needs. With this recipe, you can create a delicious and healthy snack that is perfect for any occasion.
