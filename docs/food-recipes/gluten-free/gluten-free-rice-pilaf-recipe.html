    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Rice</h3>
    <p>Start by rinsing the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming too sticky. Drain the rice thoroughly and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. Sauté the vegetables until they are softened and fragrant, about 5-7 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Toast the Rice</h3>
    <p>Add the rinsed and drained rice to the skillet with the sautéed vegetables. Stir well to coat the rice with the oil or butter. Toast the rice for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, until it becomes slightly translucent.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Broth and Seasonings</h3>
    <p>Pour in the gluten-free chicken or vegetable broth, and add the salt and black pepper. Stir to combine all the ingredients. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the skillet with a tight-fitting lid and let the rice simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fluff and Garnish</h3>
    <p>Once the rice is cooked, remove the skillet from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Then, fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains. Stir in the chopped parsley and, if desired, toasted almonds or pine nuts for added texture and flavor.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>

    <p>This gluten-free rice pilaf pairs beautifully with a variety of main dishes. Serve it alongside grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, or a hearty stew. It also makes a great addition to a holiday meal or potluck. For a complete gluten-free meal, consider pairing it with a fresh salad and a gluten-free dessert.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use brown rice instead of white rice?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute brown rice for white rice in this recipe. Keep in mind that brown rice typically requires a longer cooking time and more liquid, so you may need to adjust the cooking time and broth quantity accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can easily be made vegan by using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and substituting olive oil for butter. Ensure that all other ingredients are vegan-friendly as well.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other vegetables to the pilaf?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Feel free to customize this recipe by adding other vegetables such as bell peppers, peas, or zucchini. Just be sure to adjust the cooking time as needed to ensure all vegetables are properly cooked.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover rice pilaf in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat it in the microwave or on the stovetop with a splash of broth or water to keep it moist.</p>
