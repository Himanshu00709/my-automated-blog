    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by finely chopping the onion, celery, and garlic. Chop the fresh parsley and sage as well. Ensure that all your ingredients are prepped and ready to go before you start cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Sausage Meat</h3>
    <p>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the gluten-free sausage meat. Break it up with a wooden spoon and cook until it's browned and cooked through. This should take about 8-10 minutes. Once cooked, remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the chopped onion, celery, and garlic. Sauté until the vegetables are softened and fragrant, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in the fresh parsley and sage, and cook for another minute.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked sausage meat, sautéed vegetables, and gluten-free breadcrumbs. Gradually add the chicken or vegetable stock, stirring until the mixture is moist but not soggy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Stuffing</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Transfer the stuffing mixture to a greased baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and crispy.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Sausage Meat Stuffing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose Quality Sausage:</strong> Opt for high-quality gluten-free sausage meat to ensure the best flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize the Herbs:</strong> Feel free to experiment with different herbs like thyme or rosemary to suit your taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the Moisture:</strong> If you prefer a drier stuffing, reduce the amount of stock. For a moister stuffing, add a bit more.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> You can prepare the stuffing mixture a day in advance and refrigerate it until you're ready to bake.</li>
    </ul>
