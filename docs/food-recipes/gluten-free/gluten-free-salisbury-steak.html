    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Salisbury Steak</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free Salisbury steak is a straightforward process that involves preparing the patties, cooking them, and then making the gravy. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Patties</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, gluten-free breadcrumbs, egg, chopped onion, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Mix the ingredients thoroughly until well combined. Shape the mixture into oval-shaped patties, about 1/2 inch thick.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Patties</h3>

    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the patties and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are browned and cooked through. Remove the patties from the skillet and set them aside on a plate.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Gravy</h3>

    <p>In the same skillet, add the gluten-free flour and stir it into the remaining oil and juices. Cook for about 1-2 minutes to create a roux. Gradually whisk in the beef broth and Worcestershire sauce, making sure to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the gravy thickens, about 5-7 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine and Serve</h3>

    <p>Return the cooked patties to the skillet, spooning the gravy over them. Let everything simmer together for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Serve the Salisbury steak hot, with mashed potatoes or steamed vegetables on the side.</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>

    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Is Worcestershire sauce gluten-free?</h3>
