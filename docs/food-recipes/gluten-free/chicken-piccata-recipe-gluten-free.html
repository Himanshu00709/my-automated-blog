<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
<p>Start by placing the chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper. Using a meat mallet or rolling pin, gently pound the chicken to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch. This ensures even cooking and tender chicken.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Season and Coat the Chicken</h3>
<p>In a shallow dish, combine the gluten-free flour, salt, and black pepper. Dredge each chicken breast in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess. This coating will help create a golden crust on the chicken.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cook the Chicken</h3>
<p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside on a plate.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Make the Sauce</h3>
<p>In the same skillet, add the butter and minced garlic. Sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant. Pour in the chicken broth and lemon juice, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the capers and let the sauce simmer for 2-3 minutes until slightly reduced.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Combine and Serve</h3>
<p>Return the chicken to the skillet, spooning the sauce over the top. Let it simmer for another 2 minutes to heat through. Sprinkle with fresh parsley before serving. Serve the chicken piccata with your favorite gluten-free pasta, rice, or steamed vegetables.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use chicken thighs if you prefer. They will have a slightly richer flavor and may require a longer cooking time to ensure they are fully cooked.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>If you don’t have gluten-free flour, you can use almond flour or cornstarch as a substitute. Both will work well for coating the chicken.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this dish dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like olive oil or a plant-based butter. The flavor will be slightly different, but it will still be delicious.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in a skillet or microwave before serving.</p>
