    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions for making gluten-free Thin Mints.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure all the dry ingredients are evenly distributed. Add the softened butter, egg, peppermint extract, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms. If the dough is too dry, you can add a tablespoon of milk to bring it together.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Chill the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough is prepared, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Chilling the dough will make it easier to roll out and cut into shapes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Roll and Cut the Cookies</h3>
    <p>After the dough has chilled, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking) to about ¼ inch thickness. Use a round cookie cutter to cut out the cookies. Place the cookies on a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving some space between each cookie.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes. Keep an eye on them to prevent over-baking. Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Prepare the Chocolate Coating</h3>
    <p>While the cookies are cooling, prepare the chocolate coating. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the dark chocolate chips and coconut oil. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate is fully melted and smooth. Add a few drops of peppermint extract to the melted chocolate for an extra minty flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Dip the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Once the cookies are completely cooled, dip each one into the melted chocolate, ensuring they are fully coated. Use a fork to lift the cookies out of the chocolate, allowing any excess to drip off. Place the coated cookies back on the parchment-lined baking sheet.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Let the Chocolate Set</h3>
    <p>Allow the chocolate coating to set at room temperature or place the cookies in the refrigerator for faster setting. Once the chocolate is firm, your gluten-free Thin Mints are ready to enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flour blends, such as almond flour or oat flour. However, the texture and flavor of the cookies may vary slightly depending on the flour you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make vegan gluten-free Thin Mints, substitute the butter with a plant-based alternative and use a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of a regular egg.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store your gluten-free Thin Mints in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. For longer storage, you can keep them in the refrigerator for up to two weeks or freeze them for up to three months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use milk chocolate if you prefer a sweeter flavor. Just make sure the chocolate is gluten-free, as some brands may contain gluten.</p>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Making gluten-free Thin Mints at home is a fun and rewarding process that allows you to enjoy a classic treat without compromising your dietary needs. With the right ingredients and a little patience, you can create cookies that are just as delicious as the original. Whether you’re making them for yourself or sharing with friends and family, these gluten-free Thin Mints are sure to be a hit. Happy baking!</p>
