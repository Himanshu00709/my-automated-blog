    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the steps to make this delicious gluten-free corn pudding.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you’re ready to bake the pudding.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Corn</h3>
    <p>If you’re using fresh corn, cut the kernels off the cob. If you’re using frozen corn, make sure it’s thawed and drained well. You can also use canned corn, but be sure to drain and rinse it thoroughly to remove any excess sodium.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, baking powder, salt, and black pepper. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure they’re evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, heavy cream, milk, and melted butter. Make sure the mixture is well combined and smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Once the mixture is smooth, fold in the corn kernels.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Pudding</h3>
    <p>Pour the mixture into a greased baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the center is set. You can test the doneness by inserting a knife into the center; it should come out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the corn pudding to cool for a few minutes before serving. It’s best enjoyed warm, and it pairs wonderfully with roasted meats, grilled vegetables, or a fresh salad.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Corn Pudding</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free corn pudding turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that’s designed for baking to ensure the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense pudding. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a sweeter pudding, you can increase the amount of sugar. Conversely, if you like it more savory, reduce the sugar or omit it altogether.</li>
        <li><strong>Add-ins:</strong> Feel free to customize your corn pudding by adding ingredients like diced jalapeños, shredded cheese, or fresh herbs.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this recipe dairy-free by substituting the heavy cream and milk with non-dairy alternatives like almond milk, coconut milk, or oat milk. Use a dairy-free butter substitute as well.</p>

        <h3>Can I use canned corn instead of fresh or frozen?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use canned corn. Just make sure to drain and rinse it well to remove any excess sodium.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free corn pudding?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the corn pudding. Allow it to cool completely, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 2 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before reheating.</p>
