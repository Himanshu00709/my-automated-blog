    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free Bisquick cobbler is incredibly straightforward. Follow these steps for a foolproof dessert:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your cobbler bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Fruit</h3>
    <p>Wash and slice your chosen fruit. If you’re using berries, you can leave them whole. For peaches or apples, slice them into thin pieces. Toss the fruit with a tablespoon of sugar and a dash of cinnamon if desired.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Cobbler Batter</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free Bisquick mix, milk, sugar, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Stir until the batter is smooth and free of lumps.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Cobbler</h3>
    <p>Spread the prepared fruit evenly in a baking dish. Pour the batter over the fruit, ensuring it covers the fruit completely. If you like, sprinkle a little extra sugar on top for a caramelized finish.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling. Let the cobbler cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Cobbler</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose Fresh or Frozen Fruit:</strong> Both fresh and frozen fruit work well in this recipe. If using frozen fruit, there’s no need to thaw it beforehand.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add a splash of lemon juice or a pinch of nutmeg to enhance the flavor of your cobbler.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Warm:</strong> Cobbler is best enjoyed warm, preferably with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ul>
