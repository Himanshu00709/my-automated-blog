    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Beef</h3>
    <p>Start by thinly slicing the beef into strips. Season the beef with salt and pepper, then lightly coat it with gluten-free flour. This will help thicken the sauce later on.</p>

    <h3>2. Cook the Beef</h3>
    <p>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil or butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef strips and cook until browned on all sides. Remove the beef from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of olive oil or butter. Sauté the chopped onion and minced garlic until softened, about 2-3 minutes. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and become tender, about 5 minutes.</p>

    <h3>4. Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>Return the beef to the skillet with the vegetables. Pour in the beef broth and bring the mixture to a simmer. Stir in the Dijon mustard and let the sauce thicken slightly. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the sour cream. Be careful not to let the sauce boil, as this can cause the sour cream to curdle.</p>

    <h3>5. Cook the Noodles</h3>
    <p>While the sauce is simmering, cook the gluten-free noodles according to the package instructions. Once cooked, drain and set aside.</p>

    <h3>6. Serve and Garnish</h3>
    <p>To serve, place a portion of the cooked noodles on a plate and top with the beef stroganoff mixture. Garnish with fresh parsley for a pop of color and added flavor.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use chicken or even pork as a substitute for beef. However, the cooking time may vary depending on the type of meat you choose.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of sour cream?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer a dairy-free option, you can use coconut cream or a dairy-free yogurt alternative. Just make sure it’s unsweetened to maintain the savory flavor of the dish.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the beef stroganoff ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop, adding a little extra broth if needed to thin the sauce.</p>

        <h3>What are the best gluten-free noodles to use?</h3>
        <p>Rice noodles, quinoa noodles, or even zucchini noodles (zoodles) are great gluten-free options. Choose based on your personal preference and dietary needs.</p>
