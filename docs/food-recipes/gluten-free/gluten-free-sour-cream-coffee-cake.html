    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get baking! Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free sour cream coffee cake:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round or square baking pan and set it aside. You can also line the pan with parchment paper for easier removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer on medium speed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Incorporate the Sour Cream</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the sour cream to the butter mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. The batter should be smooth and thick.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Prepare the Topping</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar, ground cinnamon, and chopped nuts (if using). This will be your streusel topping.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Layer the Batter and Topping</h3>
    <p>Pour half of the batter into the prepared baking pan. Sprinkle half of the streusel topping over the batter. Add the remaining batter and top with the rest of the streusel mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Bake and Cool</h3>
    <p>Bake the cake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. Just make sure it's a 1:1 substitute for all-purpose flour. Some popular options include almond flour, coconut flour, or a store-bought gluten-free flour blend.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the sour cream with a dairy-free alternative like coconut yogurt or a vegan sour cream. Similarly, you can use a plant-based butter substitute in place of regular butter.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the coffee cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the coffee cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months. Just make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil before freezing.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other toppings?</h3>
        <p>Certainly! Feel free to get creative with your toppings. You can add fresh fruit, chocolate chips, or even a drizzle of glaze on top of the cake for extra flavor.</p>
