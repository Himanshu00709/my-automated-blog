    <h1>Chicken Katsu Gluten-Free: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>Chicken Katsu is a beloved Japanese dish that features crispy, breaded chicken cutlets served with a tangy sauce.

            <td>As needed</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by pounding the chicken breasts to an even thickness. This ensures that they cook evenly.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes: one with gluten-free flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with gluten-free breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Dredge each chicken breast in the flour, shaking off any excess. Then dip it into the beaten eggs, and finally coat it with the breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the breaded chicken breasts and fry until golden brown on both sides, about 4-5 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the skillet and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve the Chicken Katsu with shredded cabbage, steamed rice, and gluten-free katsu sauce.</li>
