    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Coating</h3>
    <p>In a shallow bowl, mix the gluten-free flour, salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. In another bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. Place the gluten-free breadcrumbs in a third bowl. This setup will allow you to coat the steak evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Coat the Steak</h3>
    <p>Take each piece of cube steak and dredge it in the flour mixture, making sure it’s fully coated. Next, dip it into the egg mixture, and finally, coat it with the gluten-free breadcrumbs. Press the breadcrumbs gently onto the steak to ensure they stick.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Fry the Steak</h3>
    <p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the coated steaks into the skillet. Fry each side for about 4-5 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Be careful not to overcrowd the skillet—fry in batches if necessary.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Drain and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the steaks are cooked, transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil. Serve your gluten-free country fried steak with mashed potatoes, gravy, and your favorite vegetables for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Country Fried Steak</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a meat mallet to tenderize the steak before coating it. This will ensure a more even texture.</li>
        <li>If you prefer a lighter version, you can bake the steak in the oven at 375°F (190°C) for 20-25 minutes instead of frying.</li>
        <li>For extra flavor, add a pinch of cayenne pepper or smoked paprika to the flour mixture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use chicken or pork cutlets instead of beef. Just make sure to adjust the cooking time accordingly.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>You can use crushed gluten-free crackers or cornflakes as a substitute for breadcrumbs.</p>

        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the milk with a dairy-free alternative like almond milk or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover steak in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or on the stovetop to maintain crispiness.</p>
