<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free pizza can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll achieve a perfect crust every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Roll it thin:</strong> Gluten-free dough tends to be denser, so rolling it out thin will help it cook evenly and achieve a crispy texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-bake the crust:</strong> For an extra crispy crust, pre-bake the dough for 5 minutes before adding your toppings.</li>
    <li><strong>Use a pizza stone:</strong> A pizza stone helps distribute heat evenly, resulting in a perfectly cooked crust.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't overload with toppings:</strong> Too many toppings can make the dough soggy. Stick to a few high-quality ingredients for the best results.</li>
</ul>
