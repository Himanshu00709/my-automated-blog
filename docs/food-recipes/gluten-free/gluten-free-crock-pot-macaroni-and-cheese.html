    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to make your gluten-free crock pot macaroni and cheese:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong> Boil the gluten-free elbow macaroni according to the package instructions, but reduce the cooking time by 1-2 minutes. The pasta will continue to cook in the crock pot, so you want it to be slightly undercooked. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Sauce:</strong> In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the milk, heavy cream, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and mustard powder. Stir until well combined and heated through. Gradually add the shredded cheddar cheese, stirring constantly until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine in the Crock Pot:</strong> Transfer the cooked pasta to the crock pot. Pour the cheese sauce over the pasta and stir to combine. If desired, sprinkle gluten-free breadcrumbs on top for a crunchy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook on Low:</strong> Cover the crock pot and cook on low for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. The mac and cheese is ready when the sauce is bubbly and the pasta is tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Once cooked, give the mac and cheese a final stir and serve hot. Garnish with additional shredded cheese or fresh herbs if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free crock pot macaroni and cheese turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Pasta:</strong> Not all gluten-free pastas are created equal. Look for brands that hold up well during cooking and don’t become mushy. Brown rice or quinoa-based pastas are great options.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Freshly Shredded Cheese:</strong> Pre-shredded cheese often contains anti-caking agents that can affect the texture of your sauce. For the creamiest results, shred your cheese from a block.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook:</strong> Keep an eye on the cooking time in the crock pot. Overcooking can cause the pasta to become too soft and the sauce to separate.</li>
        <li><strong>Add-ins:</strong> Feel free to customize your mac and cheese with add-ins like cooked bacon, sautéed vegetables, or diced ham for extra flavor and texture.</li>
    </ul>
