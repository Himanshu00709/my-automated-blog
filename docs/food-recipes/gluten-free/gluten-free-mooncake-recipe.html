    <h1>Gluten-Free Mooncake Recipe: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>Mooncakes are a traditional Chinese pastry enjoyed during the Mid-Autumn Festival. These round, dense cakes are often filled with sweet or savory ingredients and are a symbol of reunion and celebration. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, traditional mooncakes can be off-limits due to their wheat-based crust. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can create gluten-free mooncakes that are just as delicious and festive. In this article, we’ll guide you through a step-by-step recipe for gluten-free mooncakes, along with tips, FAQs, and more.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Mooncakes?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free mooncakes are an excellent option for individuals who need to avoid gluten but still want to partake in the Mid-Autumn Festival traditions. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and other health problems for those with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease. By using gluten-free flours and ingredients, you can enjoy mooncakes without compromising your health or dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and almond flour. In a separate bowl, mix the golden syrup, vegetable oil, and water until well combined. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a smooth dough forms. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>If you’re using salted egg yolks, steam them for about 10 minutes until they are firm. Let them cool, then cut them in half. Take small portions of the lotus seed paste and wrap each egg yolk half in the paste, forming a ball. If you’re not using egg yolks, simply roll the lotus seed paste into small balls.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Mooncakes</h3>
    <p>Divide the dough into equal portions, depending on the size of your mooncake mold. Flatten each portion into a disc, place a filling ball in the center, and carefully wrap the dough around the filling. Seal the edges and roll it into a smooth ball.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Shape and Bake</h3>
    <p>Lightly dust your mooncake mold with gluten-free flour. Place the filled dough ball into the mold and press firmly to shape. Gently remove the mooncake from the mold and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Glaze and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the mooncakes are baked, let them cool completely. For a glossy finish, brush the tops with a thin layer of golden syrup. Allow the mooncakes to rest for 1-2 days before serving, as this allows the flavors to meld and the crust to soften slightly.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Mooncakes</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use other fillings besides lotus seed paste?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While lotus seed paste is traditional, you can experiment with other fillings such as red bean paste, black sesame paste, or even chocolate. Just ensure that the fillings are gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I store gluten-free mooncakes?</h3>
        <p>Store your mooncakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate them for up to 2 weeks or freeze them for up to 3 months. Thaw before serving.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make these mooncakes vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make vegan gluten-free mooncakes by substituting the golden syrup with agave syrup or maple syrup and omitting the salted egg yolks. Use a plant-based oil like coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.</p>

        <h3>4. Why do I need to let the mooncakes rest before serving?</h3>
        <p>Resting allows the crust to soften and the flavors to develop fully. Freshly baked mooncakes can be a bit dry, but after resting, they become more tender and flavorful.</p>
