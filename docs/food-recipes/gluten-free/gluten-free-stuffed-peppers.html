    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Peppers</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes. Rinse the peppers thoroughly and set them aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, cook the ground turkey or beef over medium heat until browned. If you’re making a vegetarian version, skip this step. Add the cooked quinoa, black beans, diced tomatoes, and spices to the skillet. Stir well to combine and let the mixture simmer for 5-7 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Stuff the Peppers</h3>
    <p>Carefully spoon the filling into the prepared bell peppers, pressing down gently to pack the mixture. Place the stuffed peppers in a baking dish and top each one with shredded cheese.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake</h3>
    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the cheese is bubbly and golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Let the stuffed peppers cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh herbs like cilantro or parsley for an extra touch of flavor.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Stuffed Peppers</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free stuffed peppers are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. Bell peppers are rich in vitamins A and C, which support immune health and skin vitality. Quinoa provides a complete protein source, making this dish ideal for vegetarians and vegans. Black beans add fiber and plant-based protein, while the spices offer anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>

        <h3>Are stuffed peppers freezer-friendly?</h3>
