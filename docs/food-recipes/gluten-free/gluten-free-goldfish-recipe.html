    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems. Even for those without gluten sensitivities, reducing gluten intake can sometimes improve digestion and overall well-being. By making your own gluten-free Goldfish crackers, you can enjoy a beloved snack without worrying about gluten-related health concerns.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2>

    <p>To make gluten-free Goldfish crackers, you’ll need a few simple ingredients. Most of these can be found in your pantry or at your local grocery store. Here’s what you’ll need:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Quantity</th>

            <tr>

    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by combining the gluten-free flour blend, shredded cheddar cheese, cold butter, salt, and garlic powder in a food processor. Pulse the mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add cold water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overmix the dough, as this can make it tough.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Roll Out the Dough</h3>

    <p>Once the dough is ready, transfer it to a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Roll the dough out to about 1/8-inch thickness. If the dough is too sticky, you can place it between two sheets of parchment paper to make rolling easier.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cut the Crackers</h3>

    <p>Using a small fish-shaped cookie cutter (or any small cutter of your choice), cut out the crackers from the rolled dough. Place the cutouts on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving a little space between each cracker.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Crackers</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the crackers for 10-12 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Keep an eye on them, as they can burn quickly due to their small size.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once baked, remove the crackers from the oven and let them cool completely on the baking sheet. They will continue to crisp up as they cool. Store the crackers in an airtight container for up to a week.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Goldfish Crackers</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Ingredients:</strong> Cold butter and water help create a flaky texture in the crackers.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can make the crackers tough. Mix just until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add other seasonings like paprika, onion powder, or even a pinch of cayenne for a spicy kick.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store the crackers in an airtight container to maintain their crispiness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different types of cheese. However, sharp cheddar cheese provides the best flavor and texture for this recipe. If you use a softer cheese, you may need to adjust the amount of flour to achieve the right dough consistency.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these crackers dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make dairy-free Goldfish crackers by using a dairy-free cheese alternative and vegan butter. Keep in mind that the flavor and texture may vary slightly from the original recipe.</p>

        <h3>How long do these crackers last?</h3>
        <p>When stored in an airtight container, these crackers can last up to a week. For longer storage, you can freeze the baked crackers for up to a month.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different shape for the crackers?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you don’t have a fish-shaped cutter, you can use any small cookie cutter or even cut the dough into small squares with a knife.</p>
    </div>
