    <h1>Kung Pao Chicken Gluten-Free: A Delicious and Healthy Twist</h1>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Kung Pao Chicken</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free Kung Pao Chicken is straightforward and can be done in just a few steps:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the gluten-free soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey (or sugar), and cornstarch. Stir until the cornstarch is fully dissolved. This will be your sauce mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the diced chicken and cook until it’s no longer pink, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Sauté the Aromatics</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the minced garlic, ginger, and dried red chili peppers. Sauté for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Everything</h3>
    <p>Return the cooked chicken to the skillet and pour in the sauce mixture. Stir well to coat the chicken evenly. Add the peanuts and green onions, and continue to cook for another 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens and everything is well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve</h3>
    <p>Serve your gluten-free Kung Pao Chicken hot, garnished with additional green onions if desired. It pairs wonderfully with steamed rice or gluten-free noodles.</p>
