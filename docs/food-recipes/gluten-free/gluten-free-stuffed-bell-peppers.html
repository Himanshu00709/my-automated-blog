<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Bell Peppers</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes. Rinse them thoroughly and set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Cook the Filling</h3>
<p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, sautéing until fragrant. If using ground meat, add it to the skillet and cook until browned. Stir in the cooked quinoa, black beans, diced tomatoes, and your choice of gluten-free spices. Mix well and let the filling simmer for 5-10 minutes.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Stuff the Bell Peppers</h3>
<p>Carefully spoon the filling into each bell pepper, pressing down gently to ensure they are fully stuffed. Place the stuffed peppers in a baking dish.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Bake</h3>
<p>If desired, sprinkle shredded cheese on top of each pepper. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</h3>
<p>Once out of the oven, let the peppers cool for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve warm. Enjoy your gluten-free stuffed bell peppers!</p>
