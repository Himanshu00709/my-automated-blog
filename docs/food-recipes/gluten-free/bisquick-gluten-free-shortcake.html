    <h2>How to Make Bisquick Gluten-Free Shortcake</h2>

    <p>Making Bisquick Gluten-Free Shortcake is a straightforward process that yields delicious results. Follow these steps to create your own gluten-free shortcake:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 425°F (220°C). This ensures that your shortcake bakes evenly and rises properly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the Bisquick Gluten-Free Baking Mix and granulated sugar. Stir until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut in the Butter:</strong> Add the cold butter to the dry ingredients. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, cut the butter into the mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk and egg. Gradually add this mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense shortcake.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour if necessary). Gently pat the dough into a circle about 1/2 inch thick. Cut the dough into rounds using a biscuit cutter or a glass.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the shortcake rounds on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the shortcakes are golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once the shortcakes have cooled slightly, split them in half and top with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Bisquick Gluten-Free Shortcake</h2>

    <p>To ensure your Bisquick Gluten-Free Shortcake turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for creating a flaky texture in your shortcake. If the butter is too warm, it will melt into the dough, resulting in a denser final product.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough shortcakes. Mix the ingredients until just combined, and handle the dough as little as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> While strawberries and whipped cream are classic toppings, feel free to get creative. Try using blueberries, raspberries, or even a drizzle of chocolate sauce for a unique twist.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> If you have leftovers, store the shortcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two days. Reheat them in the oven for a few minutes before serving to restore their freshness.</li>
    </ul>
