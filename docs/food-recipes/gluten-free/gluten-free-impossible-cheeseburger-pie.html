<h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>

<p>If you're using a store-bought gluten-free pie crust, follow the package instructions for pre-baking. If you're making your own crust, prepare it according to your favorite gluten-free recipe. Once the crust is ready, set it aside to cool slightly.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Cook the Filling</h3>

<p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until the onion is translucent. Add the Impossible Burger and cook until it's browned and crumbled. Stir in the tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble the Pie</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread the cooked filling evenly into the prepared pie crust. Sprinkle the shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheese on top, ensuring full coverage.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Bake the Pie</h3>

<p>Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the crust is golden brown. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</p>

<h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Impossible Cheeseburger Pie</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Customize Your Toppings:</strong> Feel free to add your favorite burger toppings, such as pickles, lettuce, or even a drizzle of gluten-free special sauce, after baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Make It Ahead:</strong> You can prepare the filling a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. Assemble and bake the pie when you're ready to serve.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Cheese:</strong> While cheddar and mozzarella are classic choices, you can experiment with other cheeses like pepper jack or gouda for a unique twist.</li>
</ul>
