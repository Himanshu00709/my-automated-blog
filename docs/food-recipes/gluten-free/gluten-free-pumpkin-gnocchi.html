    <h1>Gluten-Free Pumpkin Gnocchi: A Delicious Fall Recipe</h1>
    <p>As the leaves change color and the air turns crisp, there's no better way to embrace the flavors of fall than with a warm, comforting bowl of gluten-free pumpkin gnocchi. This dish combines the earthy sweetness of pumpkin with the pillowy softness of gnocchi, creating a meal that's both nutritious and indulgent. Whether you're gluten-intolerant or simply looking to try something new, this recipe is sure to become a seasonal favorite.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Pumpkin Gnocchi?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals seeking to reduce inflammation or improve digestive health. Traditional gnocchi is made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, by substituting gluten-free flours like rice flour or almond flour, you can enjoy this classic Italian dish without compromising on taste or texture.</p>
    <p>Adding pumpkin to the mix not only enhances the flavor but also boosts the nutritional profile. Pumpkin is rich in vitamins A and C, fiber, and antioxidants, making it a healthy addition to any meal. The combination of gluten-free flour and pumpkin creates a gnocchi that's light, fluffy, and perfect for a cozy autumn dinner.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, pumpkin puree, egg, salt, and nutmeg. Mix until the ingredients come together to form a dough. If the dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour. If it's too dry, add a teaspoon of water. Knead the dough gently until it's smooth and pliable.</p>

    <h3>2. Shape the Gnocchi</h3>
    <p>Divide the dough into four equal parts. Roll each part into a long rope, about 1/2 inch in diameter. Cut the ropes into 1-inch pieces. You can leave the gnocchi as is or use a fork to create ridges, which help the sauce cling to the gnocchi.</p>

    <h3>3. Cook the Gnocchi</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. Cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until the gnocchi float to the surface. Remove them with a slotted spoon and set aside.</p>

    <h3>4. Prepare the Sage Butter Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Add the sage leaves and cook until they become crispy, about 2 minutes. Be careful not to burn the butter. Add the cooked gnocchi to the skillet and toss to coat them in the sage butter sauce.</p>

    <h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Transfer the gnocchi to serving plates and garnish with additional crispy sage leaves if desired. Serve immediately and enjoy the warm, comforting flavors of fall.</p>
