    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get cooking! Follow these steps to create your gluten-free taco pie:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>If you’re using a store-bought gluten-free pie crust, follow the package instructions for pre-baking. If you’re making your own crust, prepare it according to your favorite gluten-free recipe. Pre-baking the crust ensures it stays crisp and holds up well under the filling.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Meat</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or turkey over medium heat until it’s fully browned. Drain any excess fat, then add the taco seasoning and a splash of water. Stir well to combine and let it simmer for a few minutes until the flavors meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Spread the cooked meat evenly over the bottom of the pre-baked pie crust. Layer the black beans, corn, and diced tomatoes on top of the meat. Sprinkle the shredded cheese over the entire pie, ensuring it’s evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Pie</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the assembled pie in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Keep an eye on the crust to ensure it doesn’t over-brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add Toppings and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the pie is out of the oven, let it cool for a few minutes. Add your favorite toppings, such as sour cream, guacamole, and fresh cilantro. Slice and serve warm, enjoying the delicious combination of flavors and textures.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Taco Pie</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make this recipe dairy-free by using a dairy-free cheese alternative and skipping the sour cream. There are many plant-based cheese options available that melt well and taste great.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of ground beef?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use ground beef, you can substitute it with ground turkey, chicken, or even a plant-based meat alternative. Each option will give the pie a slightly different flavor profile, so feel free to experiment.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftover gluten-free taco pie can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply place a slice in the microwave or oven until warmed through.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this dish?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the taco pie either before or after baking. If freezing before baking, assemble the pie but leave off any toppings. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, then freeze for up to 2 months. When ready to bake, thaw in the refrigerator overnight and bake as directed. If freezing after baking, let the pie cool completely, then wrap and freeze. Reheat in the oven when ready to serve.</p>
