    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Tart Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut flour, and granulated sugar. Add the cold, cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until the dough comes together. Press the dough evenly into a tart pan, making sure to cover the bottom and sides. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Let it cool completely before adding the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Creamy Filling</h3>
    <p>While the crust is cooling, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add the heavy cream and powdered sugar, continuing to beat until the mixture is light and fluffy. Spread the filling evenly over the cooled tart crust.</p>

    <h3>3. Arrange the Fresh Fruits</h3>
    <p>Wash and slice your chosen fruits into thin, even pieces. Arrange the fruits on top of the cream filling in a decorative pattern. You can create concentric circles, a rainbow design, or any pattern you like. Be creative and have fun with it!</p>

    <h3>4. Add the Glaze</h3>
    <p>To give your fruit tart a beautiful shine, heat the apricot jam in a small saucepan over low heat until it becomes liquid. Using a pastry brush, gently brush the melted jam over the arranged fruits. This will not only add a glossy finish but also help preserve the freshness of the fruits.</p>

    <h3>5. Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Place the tart in the refrigerator for at least an hour to allow the filling to set. Once chilled, slice and serve your gluten-free fruit tart. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour for the crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like oat flour or tapioca flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this tart ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the crust and filling a day in advance. Just assemble the tart with the fruits and glaze a few hours before serving to keep everything fresh.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What fruits work best for a fruit tart?</h3>
        <p>You can use any fruits you like, but berries, kiwi, mango, and peaches are popular choices. Make sure to use fresh, ripe fruits for the best flavor and presentation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This specific recipe is not vegan due to the use of butter, cream cheese, and heavy cream. However, you can substitute these ingredients with plant-based alternatives like coconut oil, vegan cream cheese, and coconut cream.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
