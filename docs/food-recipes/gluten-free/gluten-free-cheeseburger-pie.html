<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Crust</h3>

<p>Start by making the gluten-free crust. In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and cold butter. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to blend the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>2. Cook the Filling</h3>

<p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the filling. In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Drain any excess fat, then add the diced onion and minced garlic. Cook until the onion is translucent. Stir in the tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble the Pie</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface and transfer it to a pie dish. Press the dough into the dish and trim any excess. Spread the cooked beef mixture evenly over the crust, then sprinkle the shredded cheddar cheese on top.</p>

<h3>4. Bake and Serve</h3>

<p>Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly. Allow the pie to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your gluten-free cheeseburger pie with a side salad or your favorite gluten-free condiments.</p>
