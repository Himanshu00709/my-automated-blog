<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, salt, and chai spice mix.</li>
    <li>In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Add the egg and vanilla extract to the butter mixture, mixing until well combined.</li>
    <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add the milk one tablespoon at a time.</li>
    <li>Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
    <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Chai Cookies</h2>

<p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be tricky, but with these tips, you’ll achieve the perfect batch every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill the dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky, chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before baking. This will make it easier to handle and help the cookies hold their shape.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with chai spices:</strong> Adjust the amount of each spice to suit your taste. You can also add a pinch of black pepper for an extra kick.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chai Cookies</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like almond flour or oat flour. However, the texture and flavor may vary, so adjust the recipe as needed.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Substitute the butter with vegan butter or coconut oil, and use a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) instead of a regular egg.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
    <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I add mix-ins like chocolate chips or nuts?</h3>
    <p>Yes, feel free to add your favorite mix-ins. Chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or even dried fruit would be delicious additions.</p>
