<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Popcorn Balls</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free popcorn balls is a straightforward process that requires just a few ingredients and some basic kitchen tools. Below is a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>8 cups of popped popcorn (ensure it’s gluten-free)</li>
    <li>1 cup of gluten-free marshmallows</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of unsalted butter (or a dairy-free alternative)</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
    <li>Optional: 1/2 cup of gluten-free mix-ins (e.g., chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruit)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Popcorn: Pop the popcorn using an air popper or stovetop method. Ensure that the popcorn is free from any gluten-containing additives.</li>
    <li>Melt the Marshmallows: In a large saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the marshmallows and stir until completely melted and smooth.</li>
    <li>Combine Ingredients: Remove the saucepan from heat and quickly stir in the salt. Pour the melted marshmallow mixture over the popcorn and mix until the popcorn is evenly coated.</li>
    <li>Add Mix-Ins: If using, fold in your chosen mix-ins at this stage.</li>
    <li>Form the Balls: Lightly grease your hands with butter or cooking spray. Scoop up a handful of the popcorn mixture and press it into a ball shape. Repeat until all the mixture is used.</li>
    <li>Cool and Serve: Allow the popcorn balls to cool and set for about 15-20 minutes before serving.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Popcorn Balls</h2>

<p>Creating the perfect gluten-free popcorn balls requires a bit of finesse. Here are some tips to ensure your popcorn balls turn out just right:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Fresh Popcorn:</strong> Freshly popped popcorn works best for this recipe. Stale popcorn may not hold together as well.</li>
    <li><strong>Work Quickly:</strong> The marshmallow mixture can harden quickly, so it’s important to work fast when combining the ingredients and forming the balls.</li>
    <li><strong>Grease Your Hands:</strong> Lightly greasing your hands will prevent the mixture from sticking and make it easier to form the balls.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Don’t be afraid to get creative with your mix-ins. Try adding gluten-free chocolate chips, nuts, or even a dash of cinnamon for a unique twist.</li>
</ul>
