<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Shrimp Scampi</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free shrimp scampi is a straightforward process that involves cooking the pasta, preparing the shrimp, and combining everything in a flavorful sauce. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Cook the Gluten-Free Pasta</h3>

<p>Start by cooking the gluten-free pasta according to the package instructions. Be sure to use a pot of well-salted boiling water to enhance the pasta’s flavor. Once the pasta is al dente, drain it and set it aside. You can toss it with a little olive oil to prevent sticking if needed.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Shrimp</h3>

<p>While the pasta is cooking, prepare the shrimp. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the butter and olive oil. Once the butter has melted, add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute, or until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic, as it can become bitter.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cook the Shrimp</h3>

<p>Add the shrimp to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they turn pink and opaque. Be careful not to overcook the shrimp, as they can become tough and rubbery. Once the shrimp are cooked, remove them from the skillet and set them aside.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Make the Sauce</h3>

<p>In the same skillet, add the white wine and lemon juice, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. This will add depth of flavor to the sauce. Allow the sauce to simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until it has reduced slightly. If you like a bit of heat, you can add red pepper flakes at this stage.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Combine Everything</h3>

<p>Return the shrimp to the skillet and toss them in the sauce to coat. Add the cooked gluten-free pasta and toss everything together until well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and garnish with fresh parsley before serving.</p>
