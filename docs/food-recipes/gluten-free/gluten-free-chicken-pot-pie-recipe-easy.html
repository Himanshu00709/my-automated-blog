    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions to make your gluten-free chicken pot pie.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, and sauté until the onion is translucent. Sprinkle the gluten-free flour blend over the onion and garlic mixture, stirring constantly to create a roux. Cook for about 2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add Liquids and Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Gradually whisk in the chicken broth and milk, ensuring there are no lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring frequently until it thickens. Add the shredded chicken and frozen mixed vegetables, stirring to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out one gluten-free pie crust and place it into a 9-inch pie dish. Pour the chicken and vegetable filling into the crust. Roll out the second pie crust and place it over the filling. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges to seal. Cut a few small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Pie</h3>
    <p>Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free chicken pot pie turns out perfectly, here are a few tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend for the best texture.</li>
        <li>If you’re short on time, store-bought gluten-free pie crusts work just as well as homemade.</li>
        <li>Feel free to customize the filling with your favorite vegetables or herbs.</li>
        <li>Let the pie cool slightly before serving to allow the filling to set.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make this recipe dairy-free by substituting the butter with a dairy-free alternative (such as margarine or coconut oil) and using a dairy-free milk (like almond or oat milk).</p>

        <h3>Can I use fresh vegetables instead of frozen?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Fresh vegetables can be used in place of frozen. Just make sure to cook them until they’re tender before adding them to the filling.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the pie?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the unbaked pie for up to 2 months. When ready to bake, simply place it in the oven directly from the freezer, adding an extra 10-15 minutes to the baking time.</p>
