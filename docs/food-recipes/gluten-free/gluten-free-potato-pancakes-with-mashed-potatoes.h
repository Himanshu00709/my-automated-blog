<h1>Gluten-Free Potato Pancakes with Mashed Potatoes: A Delicious and Healthy Twist</h1>

<p>Potato pancakes, also known as latkes, are a beloved dish in many cultures. Traditionally made with grated potatoes and flour, they are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying this classic dish can be a challenge. That's where gluten-free potato pancakes come in!

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make these delicious gluten-free potato pancakes:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Mashed Potatoes</h3>

<p>If you don't already have mashed potatoes on hand, start by boiling 2-3 medium-sized potatoes until they are tender. Once cooked, mash them thoroughly with a fork or potato masher. Make sure there are no lumps, as this will ensure a smooth texture for your pancakes.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix the Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, eggs, gluten-free breadcrumbs, finely chopped onion, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper. Mix everything together until well combined. The mixture should be thick enough to hold its shape when formed into patties.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Form the Pancakes</h3>

<p>Using your hands, scoop out a portion of the mixture and form it into a small patty, about 2-3 inches in diameter. Repeat this process until all the mixture is used up. You should be able to make around 8-10 pancakes, depending on the size.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Fry the Pancakes</h3>

<p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the potato pancakes in the skillet. Cook each side for about 3-4 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy. Be sure not to overcrowd the skillet, as this can lower the temperature of the oil and result in soggy pancakes.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Once the pancakes are cooked, transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil. Serve them warm with your favorite toppings, such as sour cream, applesauce, or a sprinkle of fresh herbs. These gluten-free potato pancakes are perfect for breakfast, brunch, or even as a side dish for dinner.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Potato Pancakes</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can absolutely use sweet potatoes in this recipe. Sweet potatoes will add a slightly sweeter flavor and a vibrant orange color to your pancakes. Just make sure to mash them thoroughly before mixing with the other ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these pancakes ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the mixture ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. When you're ready to cook, simply form the pancakes and fry them as directed. You can also cook the pancakes in advance and reheat them in the oven or toaster oven to maintain their crispiness.</p>

    <h3>Are these pancakes suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>This recipe includes eggs, which are not vegan. However, you can substitute the eggs with a flaxseed or chia seed egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed or chia seeds mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) to make the pancakes vegan-friendly.</p>

    <h3>Can I bake these pancakes instead of frying them?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can bake the pancakes if you prefer a healthier option. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and place the formed pancakes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Lightly brush the tops with olive oil and bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown and crispy.</p>
