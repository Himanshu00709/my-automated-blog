    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you’ve gathered your ingredients, let’s dive into the cooking process. Follow these steps to create a mouthwatering gluten-free biscuits and gravy casserole:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Biscuit Layer</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free biscuit mix with eggs and milk according to the package instructions. Stir until a dough forms. Set aside while you prepare the gravy.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Sausage</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, cook the gluten-free sausage over medium heat until browned and fully cooked. Break it into crumbles as it cooks. Once done, remove the sausage from the skillet and set aside, leaving the drippings in the pan for the gravy.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Make the Gravy</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the gluten-free flour blend and whisk continuously to create a roux. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the mixture is golden brown. Gradually pour in the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until it thickens. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Casserole</h3>
    <p>In a greased 9x13 inch baking dish, spread the cooked sausage evenly across the bottom. Pour the gravy over the sausage, ensuring it’s evenly distributed. Drop spoonfuls of the biscuit dough on top of the gravy layer, spacing them out to allow for expansion during baking.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Bake and Serve</h3>
    <p>Place the casserole in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the biscuit layer is golden brown and cooked through. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy this comforting dish warm, straight from the oven!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Biscuits and Gravy Casserole</h2>
    <p>To ensure your casserole turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Opt for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Biscuit Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense biscuits. Stir just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Gravy Thickness:</strong> If your gravy is too thick, add a splash of milk. If it’s too thin, let it simmer a bit longer.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to add vegetables like sautéed mushrooms or spinach for extra flavor and nutrition.</li>
    </ul>

        <p>Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
        <h3>Can I freeze this casserole?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the casserole before or after baking. If freezing before baking, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before cooking. If freezing after baking, reheat in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until warmed through.</p>
