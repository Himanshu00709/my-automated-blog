<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make these delicious gluten-free protein pancakes:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, protein powder, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Mix these dry ingredients thoroughly to ensure there are no lumps. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, and sweetener. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until you achieve a smooth batter. If the batter is too thick, you can add a little more milk to reach your desired consistency.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Heat the Pan</h3>

<p>Preheat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease the surface with a small amount of oil or cooking spray to prevent the pancakes from sticking. Allow the pan to heat up for a minute or two before you start cooking.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cook the Pancakes</h3>

<p>Pour about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the heated skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges begin to look set, which should take about 2-3 minutes. Flip the pancake and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes on the other side, or until golden brown. Repeat this process with the remaining batter.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Once all the pancakes are cooked, stack them on a plate and serve with your favorite toppings. Fresh fruits, a drizzle of honey or maple syrup, and a dollop of Greek yogurt are excellent choices. You can also add a sprinkle of nuts or seeds for an extra crunch.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make these pancakes vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can easily make these pancakes vegan by substituting the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and using a plant-based protein powder. Additionally, use a non-dairy milk like almond or oat milk.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze these pancakes?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! These pancakes freeze well. Allow them to cool completely, then place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze. Once frozen, transfer them to a zip-top bag or airtight container. They can be reheated in the toaster or microwave for a quick breakfast.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of protein powder?</h3>
    <p>If you don't have protein powder, you can increase the amount of gluten-free flour or add a mashed banana or some Greek yogurt to the batter for added protein and moisture.</p>

    <h3>Are these pancakes suitable for kids?</h3>
    <p>Yes, these pancakes are kid-friendly and can be a great way to sneak in some extra protein and nutrients into your child's diet. You can also add fun toppings like chocolate chips or fruit to make them more appealing to kids.</p>
