    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the steps to make the perfect gluten-free banana bread:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you’re ready to bake, which is crucial for even cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Banana Bread Mix</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the Krusteaz Gluten-Free Banana Bread Mix with the mashed bananas, eggs, water, and vegetable oil. Mix until all the ingredients are well combined. The batter should be smooth and free of lumps.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Pour the Batter into a Loaf Pan</h3>
    <p>Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with a little oil or use a non-stick spray. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly with a spatula.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Banana Bread</h3>
    <p>Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for 50-60 minutes. To check if the bread is done, insert a toothpick into the center. If it comes out clean, your banana bread is ready. If not, bake for an additional 5-10 minutes and check again.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the banana bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing. Serve warm or at room temperature, and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Banana Bread</h2>
    <p>Here are some expert tips to ensure your Krusteaz Gluten-Free Banana Bread turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Ripe Bananas:</strong> The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more flavorful your bread will be. Look for bananas with brown spots on the skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense and tough bread. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Mix-Ins:</strong> Feel free to add your favorite mix-ins like nuts, chocolate chips, or dried fruit to customize your banana bread.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> To keep your banana bread fresh, store it in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or refrigerate for up to a week.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Krusteaz Gluten-Free Banana Bread</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use this mix to make muffins instead of a loaf?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can! Simply pour the batter into a muffin tin lined with paper liners and bake at 350°F for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

        <h3>2. Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>The original recipe calls for eggs, but you can substitute them with a vegan egg replacer or flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg).</p>

        <h3>3. Can I freeze the banana bread?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Once the bread has cooled completely, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. It can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>
