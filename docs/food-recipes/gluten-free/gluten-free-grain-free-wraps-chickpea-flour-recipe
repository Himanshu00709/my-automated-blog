<h2>Why Chickpea Flour?</h2>

<p>Chickpea flour, also known as gram flour or besan, is made from ground chickpeas. It is naturally gluten-free and grain-free, making it an excellent choice for those with dietary restrictions. Beyond its suitability for gluten-free diets, chickpea flour is packed with nutrients. It is high in protein, fiber, and essential vitamins and minerals such as iron, magnesium, and B vitamins.

<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>

<p>In a mixing bowl, combine the chickpea flour, salt, and any optional spices you'd like to include. Gradually add the water while whisking to avoid lumps. The consistency should be similar to that of pancake batter. If the mixture is too thick, add a little more water. Finally, stir in the olive oil to give the wraps a smooth texture and prevent sticking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Heat the Pan</h3>

<p>Heat a non-stick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat. Lightly grease the pan with a small amount of olive oil or use a non-stick cooking spray. Ensuring the pan is properly heated is crucial for achieving the perfect wrap.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cook the Wraps</h3>

<p>Pour a ladleful of the batter into the center of the pan, tilting it to spread the batter evenly into a thin, round shape. Cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until the edges start to lift and the surface appears set. Flip the wrap carefully and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side. Repeat this process until all the batter is used.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Once cooked, the wraps can be filled with your favorite ingredients. Consider options like grilled vegetables, hummus, avocado, or a protein source like chicken or tofu. The possibilities are endless, making these wraps a versatile addition to your meal repertoire.</p>
