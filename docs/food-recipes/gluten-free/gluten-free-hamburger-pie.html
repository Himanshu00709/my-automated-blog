    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Filling</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until it’s browned. Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, diced carrots, and celery. Cook until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the tomato sauce and season with salt and pepper. Set the filling aside.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Gluten-Free Crust</h3>

    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour with a pinch of salt. Gradually add the milk (or dairy-free alternative) while stirring until a dough forms. Roll out the dough on a floured surface and place it into a pie dish. Press the dough into the dish to form the crust.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>

    <p>Pour the prepared filling into the crust-lined pie dish. If desired, sprinkle cheese on top. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Let the pie cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Hamburger Pie</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free hamburger pie is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. The ground beef provides a good source of protein, while the vegetables add essential vitamins and minerals. Using gluten-free flour ensures that the dish is safe for those with gluten intolerance, and it can also be lower in carbohydrates compared to traditional recipes.</p>
