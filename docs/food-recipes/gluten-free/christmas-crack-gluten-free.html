    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Christmas Crack</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free Christmas Crack:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Pan:</strong> Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Arrange the gluten-free crackers in a single layer on the sheet, ensuring they fit snugly together.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Toffee:</strong> In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the brown sugar and stir continuously until the mixture comes to a boil. Let it boil for 3-4 minutes, stirring constantly, until it thickens and turns a deep caramel color.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour the Toffee:</strong> Carefully pour the hot toffee mixture over the crackers, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Be cautious, as the toffee will be extremely hot.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Chocolate:</strong> Immediately sprinkle the chocolate chips over the hot toffee. Let them sit for a minute to soften, then spread the melted chocolate evenly over the toffee layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> While the chocolate is still soft, sprinkle your desired toppings over the surface. Popular choices include chopped nuts, festive sprinkles, or a pinch of sea salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Break:</strong> Allow the Christmas Crack to cool completely at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Once hardened, break it into pieces and serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Christmas Crack</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Crackers:</strong> Opt for gluten-free crackers that are sturdy and can hold up to the toffee and chocolate layers. Rice crackers or gluten-free saltines work well.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch the Toffee:</strong> Be careful not to overcook the toffee, as it can burn easily. Aim for a deep amber color and a thick consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize Your Toppings:</strong> Get creative with your toppings! Try crushed candy canes, shredded coconut, or even a drizzle of white chocolate for a festive touch.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Store your Christmas Crack in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week, or in the refrigerator for longer shelf life.</li>
    </ul>
