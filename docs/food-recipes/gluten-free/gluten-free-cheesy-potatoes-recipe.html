<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This will ensure that your dish bakes evenly and comes out perfectly golden and bubbly.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Potatoes</h3>
<p>Peel and thinly slice the russet potatoes. Thin slices will help the potatoes cook evenly and absorb the cheesy sauce better. You can use a mandoline slicer for even, consistent slices.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Mix the Sauce</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free cream of mushroom soup, sour cream, melted butter, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Stir until the mixture is smooth and well combined. This creamy sauce will coat the potatoes and give them their signature flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Layer the Potatoes and Cheese</h3>
<p>In a greased 9x13 inch baking dish, layer half of the sliced potatoes. Spread half of the creamy sauce over the potatoes, then sprinkle 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese on top. Repeat the layers with the remaining potatoes, sauce, and cheese.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Add the Topping (Optional)</h3>
<p>If you’d like a crunchy topping, sprinkle gluten-free breadcrumbs over the top layer of cheese. This adds a nice texture contrast to the creamy potatoes.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and the top is golden and bubbly.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Let the dish cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh parsley or chives if desired, and enjoy your gluten-free cheesy potatoes!</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cheesy Potatoes</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of potato?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use Yukon Gold or red potatoes if you prefer. Just keep in mind that the texture and cooking time may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free cream of mushroom soup?</h3>
    <p>You can make a homemade gluten-free cream sauce using gluten-free flour, butter, milk, and mushrooms. Alternatively, you can use gluten-free cream of chicken soup for a different flavor profile.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can assemble the dish up to a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. When you’re ready to bake, let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before putting it in the oven.</p>

    <h3>Is this recipe dairy-free as well?</h3>
    <p>No, this recipe contains dairy in the form of cheese, sour cream, and butter. However, you can substitute with dairy-free alternatives like vegan cheese, coconut cream, and plant-based butter if needed.</p>
