    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free stuffed green peppers:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Peppers:</strong> Cut the tops off the green peppers and remove the seeds and membranes. Blanch the peppers in boiling water for 3-4 minutes, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Filling:</strong> In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Sauté the onion and garlic until softened. Add the ground turkey or beef (if using) and cook until browned. Stir in the cooked quinoa or rice, diced tomatoes, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Stuff the Peppers:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Fill each pepper with the prepared filling, pressing down gently to pack it in. Place the stuffed peppers in a baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> If desired, sprinkle shredded cheese on top of each pepper. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25-30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Allow the peppers to cool slightly before serving. Garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or basil for added flavor.</li>
