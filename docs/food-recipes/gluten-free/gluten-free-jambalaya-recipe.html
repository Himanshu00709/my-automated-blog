<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
<p>Start by dicing the chicken breast, chopping the onion, bell pepper, and celery, and mincing the garlic. Ensure that all your ingredients are prepped and ready to go before you start cooking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Cook the Meats</h3>
<p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced chicken and cook until it’s no longer pink, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken and set it aside. In the same pot, add the Andouille sausage and cook until it’s browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the sausage and set it aside with the chicken.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
<p>In the same pot, add the chopped onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic. Sauté until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. This is the base of your jambalaya, so make sure the vegetables are well-cooked and fragrant.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add the Rice and Spices</h3>
<p>Add the rice to the pot and stir to coat it with the oil and vegetables. Add the paprika, cayenne pepper, thyme, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Simmer the Jambalaya</h3>
<p>Pour in the chicken broth and diced tomatoes, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let it simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and most of the liquid is absorbed.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Add the Shrimp</h3>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, add the shrimp to the pot. Stir well and cover the pot again. Cook for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until the shrimp are pink and cooked through.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Remove the bay leaves and give the jambalaya a final stir. Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley if desired. Enjoy your gluten-free jambalaya with a side of cornbread or a fresh green salad.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Jambalaya</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use brown rice instead of white rice?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use brown rice, but keep in mind that it will take longer to cook. You may need to adjust the cooking time and add more liquid to ensure the rice is fully cooked.</p>

    <h3>Is Andouille sausage always gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Not all Andouille sausages are gluten-free. Always check the label to ensure that the sausage you’re using does not contain any gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe vegetarian?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the chicken, sausage, and shrimp with plant-based alternatives like tofu, tempeh, or seitan (ensure it’s gluten-free). Use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth for a fully vegetarian version.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave, adding a splash of broth or water to keep the rice moist.</p>
