<h1>High Fiber Gluten-Free Bread Recipe</h1>

<p>For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding a bread that is both nutritious and delicious can be a challenge. Traditional gluten-free bread often lacks the fiber content that is essential for digestive health. However, with the right ingredients and a bit of patience, you can create a high-fiber, gluten-free bread that is not only healthy but also incredibly satisfying. In this article, we will guide you through a detailed recipe for making high-fiber gluten-free bread at home.</p>

<h2>Why High Fiber Gluten-Free Bread?</h2>

<p>Fiber is an essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in maintaining digestive health, regulating blood sugar levels, and promoting heart health. Unfortunately, many gluten-free products are low in fiber because they are made with refined flours and starches. By incorporating high-fiber ingredients into your gluten-free bread, you can enjoy the benefits of fiber without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>To make high-fiber gluten-free bread, you will need the following ingredients:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Ingredient</th>
        <th>Quantity</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Almond flour</td>
        <td>1 cup</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Flaxseed meal</td>
        <td>1/2 cup</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Psyllium husk powder</td>
        <td>1/4 cup</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Chia seeds</td>
        <td>2 tablespoons</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Baking powder</td>
        <td>1 teaspoon</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Salt</td>
        <td>1/2 teaspoon</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Eggs</td>
        <td>4 large</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Apple cider vinegar</td>
        <td>1 tablespoon</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Water</td>
        <td>1 cup</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Follow these step-by-step instructions to make your high-fiber gluten-free bread:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a loaf pan and set it aside.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, flaxseed meal, psyllium husk powder, chia seeds, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, apple cider vinegar, and water. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a thick dough forms.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the Dough Rest:</strong> Allow the dough to rest for 5-10 minutes. This will give the psyllium husk and chia seeds time to absorb the liquid and create a gel-like consistency, which is essential for the bread's texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Transfer the dough to the prepared loaf pan. Use a spatula or your hands to shape the dough into an even loaf.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, transfer the bread to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
</ol>
