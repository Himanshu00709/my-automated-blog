<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making the Marinade</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve covered the ingredients, let’s dive into the process of making the marinade. Follow these steps to ensure your carne asada is bursting with flavor:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>

<p>Start by gathering all your ingredients. Freshness is key, so opt for freshly squeezed lime and orange juice, and use fresh garlic and cilantro. Measure out your spices and have them ready to go.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix the Marinade</h3>

<p>In a large bowl, combine the lime juice, orange juice, minced garlic, chopped cilantro, olive oil, cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Whisk everything together until well combined. Taste the marinade and adjust the seasoning if necessary.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Marinate the Meat</h3>

<p>Place your skirt or flank steak in a large resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the meat, making sure it’s fully coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. The longer the meat marinates, the more flavorful it will be.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Grill the Carne Asada</h3>

<p>When you’re ready to cook, preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Remove the steak from the marinade and let any excess drip off. Grill the steak for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until it reaches your desired level of doneness. Let the meat rest for a few minutes before slicing it against the grain.</p>

    <h3>2. How long can I store the marinade?</h3>
    <p>The marinade can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. However, it’s best to use it fresh for maximum flavor.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I use this marinade for other types of meat?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! This marinade works well with chicken, pork, and even tofu. Adjust the marinating time based on the type of protein you’re using.</p>

    <h3>4. Is this marinade spicy?</h3>
    <p>The level of spiciness can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the amount of chili powder. If you prefer a milder flavor, you can omit the chili powder altogether.</p>
