    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create your gluten-free biscochitos:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent the cookies from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer on medium speed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Beat in the egg, anise extract, and brandy (or rum) until well combined. The mixture should be smooth and slightly creamy.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cookies tough.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Shape and Coat the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Roll the dough into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Roll each ball in the cinnamon sugar mixture until fully coated. Place the coated balls on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake, as gluten-free cookies can dry out quickly.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your gluten-free biscochitos with a cup of coffee or tea!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Biscochitos</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. However, make sure it contains xanthan gum or another binding agent to help the cookies hold their shape.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute the anise extract?</h3>
        <p>If you're not a fan of anise, you can substitute it with vanilla extract or almond extract for a different flavor profile.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free biscochitos?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Are these cookies suitable for people with celiac disease?</h3>
        <p>Yes, as long as all the ingredients used are certified gluten-free, these cookies are safe for people with celiac disease.</p>
