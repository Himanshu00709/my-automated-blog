    <h1>Gluten-Free Guacamole Recipe: A Healthy and Delicious Dip</h1>
    <p>Guacamole is a beloved dip that has its roots in Mexican cuisine. Made primarily from avocados, it’s a versatile and nutritious addition to any meal. For those following a gluten-free diet, guacamole is naturally gluten-free, making it a safe and delicious option. In this article, we’ll explore a simple yet flavorful gluten-free guacamole recipe, along with tips, variations, and answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to make the perfect gluten-free guacamole:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Avocados:</strong> Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash the Avocados:</strong> Use a fork or potato masher to mash the avocados to your desired consistency. Some prefer chunky guacamole, while others like it smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Lime Juice:</strong> Pour the lime juice over the mashed avocados to prevent browning and add a tangy flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix in the Vegetables:</strong> Add the chopped red onion, cilantro, diced tomato, minced jalapeño, and garlic (if using) to the bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Season:</strong> Sprinkle salt and black pepper over the mixture and stir everything together until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Taste and Adjust:</strong> Taste the guacamole and adjust the seasoning or lime juice as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Transfer the guacamole to a serving bowl and enjoy immediately with gluten-free tortilla chips or as a topping for your favorite dishes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Best Gluten-Free Guacamole</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Ripe Avocados:</strong> The key to great guacamole is using perfectly ripe avocados. They should be slightly soft but not mushy.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize the Heat:</strong> Adjust the amount of jalapeño to suit your spice tolerance. You can also remove the seeds for a milder flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Texture:</strong> For a chunkier guacamole, leave some avocado pieces unmashed.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Fresh:</strong> Guacamole is best enjoyed fresh, but if you need to store it, press plastic wrap directly onto the surface to minimize air exposure and prevent browning.</li>
    </ul>
