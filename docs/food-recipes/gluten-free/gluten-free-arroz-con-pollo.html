    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong> Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper. In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Brown the chicken on both sides, then remove and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Vegetables:</strong> In the same skillet, add the chopped onion, garlic, and red bell pepper. Sauté until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Rice and Spices:</strong> Stir in the rice, cumin, paprika, and saffron (if using). Cook for 2-3 minutes, allowing the rice to toast slightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Ingredients:</strong> Add the diced tomato, green peas, and gluten-free chicken broth. Stir to combine, then return the chicken thighs to the skillet.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer:</strong> Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 25-30 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the chicken is tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove from heat and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley if desired.</li>
