    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your crackers bake evenly and achieve the perfect crispiness.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the chickpea flour, salt, garlic powder, and any dried herbs you’re using. Stir well to ensure the ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add the olive oil and water to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms. The dough should be firm but pliable. If it’s too dry, add a little more water, one teaspoon at a time.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and roll it out as thinly as possible. The thinner the dough, the crispier the crackers will be. Aim for a thickness of about 1/8 inch.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cut the Crackers</h3>
    <p>Remove the top sheet of parchment paper and use a pizza cutter or knife to cut the dough into your desired cracker shapes. Squares or rectangles work well, but feel free to get creative!</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Transfer the parchment paper with the cut dough onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the crackers are golden brown and crisp. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the crackers to cool completely on the baking sheet. Once cooled, they’re ready to serve! Store any leftovers in an airtight container to maintain their crispiness.</p>
