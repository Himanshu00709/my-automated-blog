<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free shake and bake pork chops is straightforward and requires minimal effort. Follow these steps for a perfect result:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). This ensures that the pork chops cook evenly and develop a crispy coating.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Coating</h3>
<p>In a large resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish, combine the gluten-free breadcrumbs, almond flour, Parmesan cheese (if using), paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to ensure the seasonings are evenly distributed.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Coat the Pork Chops</h3>
<p>Brush each pork chop with olive oil or melted butter. This helps the coating adhere to the meat. Place one pork chop at a time into the bag or dish with the coating mixture, shaking or pressing to ensure it's fully coated. Repeat with the remaining pork chops.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Bake the Pork Chops</h3>
<p>Place the coated pork chops on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145°F (63°C). For extra crispiness, you can broil the pork chops for the last 2-3 minutes, keeping a close eye to prevent burning.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Rest and Serve</h3>
<p>Once the pork chops are done, remove them from the oven and let them rest for 5 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring a moist and flavorful bite. Serve with your favorite sides, such as roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh salad.</p>
