<h1>Gluten-Free Sausage Balls: A Red Lobster-Inspired Delight</h1>

<p>When it comes to comfort food, few dishes can rival the savory, satisfying taste of sausage balls. Traditionally made with a combination of sausage, cheese, and biscuit mix, these bite-sized treats have been a staple at parties, brunches, and family gatherings for decades. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying this classic dish can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free sausage balls—a delicious twist on the original that caters to dietary restrictions without sacrificing flavor.

Plus, with the addition of Red Lobster-inspired flavors, these gluten-free sausage balls are sure to impress even the most discerning palates.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the sausage balls from sticking and make cleanup a breeze.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free baking flour, baking powder, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and dried parsley. Whisk these ingredients together until well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>Add the shredded cheddar cheese, ground sausage, melted butter, and milk to the dry ingredients. Use your hands or a sturdy spoon to mix everything together until a dough forms. The mixture should be slightly sticky but hold together when rolled into balls.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Shape the Sausage Balls</h3>
<p>Using a tablespoon or a small cookie scoop, portion out the dough and roll it into 1-inch balls. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about an inch apart to allow for even baking.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Bake the sausage balls in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. For an extra touch of Red Lobster flavor, brush the tops of the sausage balls with melted butter and sprinkle with a bit of garlic powder and parsley as soon as they come out of the oven.</p>

<h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
<p>These gluten-free sausage balls are incredibly versatile and can be served in a variety of ways. They make an excellent appetizer for parties, a tasty addition to a brunch spread, or even a satisfying snack on their own. Pair them with a dipping sauce like marinara, ranch, or honey mustard for an extra burst of flavor. If you’re feeling adventurous, try serving them alongside a bowl of creamy soup or a fresh salad for a complete meal.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make these sausage balls ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes! You can prepare the sausage balls up to a day in advance and store them in the refrigerator until you’re ready to bake. Alternatively, you can freeze the unbaked sausage balls for up to three months. Simply place them on a baking sheet in the freezer until firm, then transfer them to a freezer-safe bag. When you’re ready to bake, add a few extra minutes to the cooking time.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely. While cheddar cheese is the classic choice for sausage balls, you can experiment with other types of cheese, such as pepper jack, mozzarella, or even a blend of cheeses. Just keep in mind that the flavor and texture may vary slightly depending on the cheese you choose.</p>

    <h3>Are these sausage balls keto-friendly?</h3>
    <p>With a few modifications, these sausage balls can be made keto-friendly. Substitute almond flour or coconut flour for the gluten-free baking flour, and use a low-carb milk alternative. Be sure to check the labels on your sausage and cheese to ensure they are low in carbs as well.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free sausage balls inspired by Red Lobster’s Cheddar Bay Biscuits are a delicious and inclusive twist on a classic recipe. Whether you’re catering to dietary restrictions or simply looking to try something new, these sausage balls are sure to be a hit. With their savory flavor, cheesy goodness, and easy preparation, they’re perfect for any occasion.
