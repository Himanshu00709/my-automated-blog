    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free cabbage rolls is a straightforward process, but it does require a bit of preparation. Follow these steps to create a delicious and satisfying dish:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Cabbage Leaves</h3>
    <p>Start by removing the core from the cabbage and placing the whole head in a large pot of boiling water. Let it simmer for about 5-10 minutes, or until the outer leaves become soft and pliable. Carefully remove the leaves one by one, using tongs to avoid burning yourself. Set the leaves aside to cool.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, cooked rice, chopped onion, minced garlic, and spices. If you’re using gluten-free breadcrumbs, add them to the mixture as well. Mix everything thoroughly until well combined.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Cabbage Rolls</h3>
    <p>Take a cabbage leaf and place a small amount of the filling in the center. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it up tightly, similar to a burrito. Repeat this process with the remaining leaves and filling.</p>

    <h3>4. Cook the Cabbage Rolls</h3>
    <p>Place the rolled cabbage leaves seam-side down in a large baking dish. Pour the tomato sauce over the rolls, making sure they are well-covered. Cover the dish with foil and bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 1.5 hours, or until the cabbage is tender and the filling is cooked through.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cabbage Rolls</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free cabbage rolls turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Cabbage:</strong> A firm, fresh cabbage will make it easier to roll and hold its shape during cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Gluten-Free Ingredients:</strong> Double-check all your ingredients, including the tomato sauce and breadcrumbs, to ensure they are gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overfill:</strong> Be careful not to overfill the cabbage leaves, as this can make them difficult to roll and may cause them to burst during cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to experiment with different spices and herbs to customize the flavor of your cabbage rolls.</li>
    </ul>
