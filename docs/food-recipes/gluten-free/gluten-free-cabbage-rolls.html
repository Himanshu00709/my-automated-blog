    <h1>Gluten-Free Cabbage Rolls: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>Cabbage rolls are a beloved dish in many cultures, known for their comforting flavors and versatility. Traditionally, cabbage rolls are made with a filling of ground meat, rice, and spices, all wrapped in tender cabbage leaves and simmered in a savory sauce.

By opting for gluten-free cabbage rolls, you can enjoy a hearty meal without compromising your health or dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Cabbage Rolls</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cabbage Leaves</h3>

    <p>Start by selecting a large head of cabbage. Remove the outer leaves and carefully peel off the larger leaves, ensuring they remain intact. Blanch the leaves in boiling water for 2-3 minutes until they become pliable. Drain and set aside to cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine your choice of ground meat (beef, pork, or turkey) with cooked gluten-free rice, finely chopped onions, minced garlic, and your preferred spices (such as paprika, thyme, and black pepper). Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Cabbage Rolls</h3>

    <p>Place a portion of the filling onto each cabbage leaf, near the stem end. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it up tightly, similar to a burrito. Repeat this process until all the filling is used.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Cabbage Rolls</h3>

    <p>Arrange the cabbage rolls in a large pot or baking dish, seam side down. Pour gluten-free tomato sauce over the rolls, ensuring they are well-covered. Cover the pot or dish with a lid or aluminum foil and bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the cabbage is tender and the filling is cooked through.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once the cabbage rolls are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving. Garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or dill, and serve with a side of gluten-free bread or a fresh salad for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Cabbage Rolls</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free cabbage rolls are not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Cabbage is a low-calorie vegetable rich in vitamins C and K, as well as fiber, which supports digestive health. The ground meat provides a good source of protein, while the rice adds complex carbohydrates for sustained energy. By using gluten-free ingredients, you can enjoy this dish without the risk of gluten-related health issues.</p>

        <p>Absolutely! Gluten-free cabbage rolls can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days before baking. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months. Just make sure to thaw them completely before cooking.</p>
