<p>Making gluten-free sweet potato waffles is simple and straightforward. Follow these steps to create a delicious and healthy breakfast:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Sweet Potatoes:</strong> Start by cooking the sweet potatoes. You can either bake them in the oven or boil them until they are soft. Once cooked, peel and mash them until smooth.</li>

    <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense waffles.</li>
