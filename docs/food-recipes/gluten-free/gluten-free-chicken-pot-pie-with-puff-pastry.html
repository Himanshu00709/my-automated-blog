<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Filling</h3>

<p>Start by melting the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Once melted, add the gluten-free flour and whisk continuously to create a roux. Cook the roux for 1-2 minutes until it turns a light golden color. Gradually pour in the gluten-free chicken broth, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Add the milk, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper, and continue to cook until the mixture thickens into a creamy sauce.</p>

<p>Next, stir in the shredded chicken and frozen mixed vegetables. Cook for an additional 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.</p>

<h3>2. Assemble the Pot Pie</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Transfer the chicken and vegetable mixture into a pie dish or oven-safe skillet. Roll out the gluten-free puff pastry and place it over the top of the filling, trimming any excess pastry. Use a fork to crimp the edges and create a decorative border. Cut a few small slits in the pastry to allow steam to escape during baking.</p>

<h3>3. Bake to Perfection</h3>

<p>Place the pot pie in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the puff pastry is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Chicken Pot Pie</h2>

<p>This gluten-free chicken pot pie is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. The chicken provides a lean source of protein, while the mixed vegetables add essential vitamins and minerals. Using gluten-free puff pastry ensures that the dish is safe for those with gluten sensitivities, and the use of gluten-free flour in the sauce maintains the creamy texture without compromising on taste.</p>

<p>Additionally, this recipe can be easily adapted to suit other dietary needs. For a dairy-free version, simply substitute the butter and milk with plant-based alternatives. This flexibility makes the dish a great option for a variety of dietary preferences.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chicken Pot Pie</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
