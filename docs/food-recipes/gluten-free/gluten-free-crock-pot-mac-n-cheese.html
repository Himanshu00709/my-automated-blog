    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free crock pot mac and cheese is surprisingly simple. Follow these steps for a foolproof dish:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong> Boil the gluten-free elbow pasta according to the package instructions, but reduce the cooking time by 1-2 minutes. The pasta will continue to cook in the crock pot, so you want it slightly underdone.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Sauce:</strong> In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the milk, heavy cream, garlic powder, mustard powder, salt, and pepper. Stir until well combined and heated through.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Ingredients:</strong> Transfer the cooked pasta to the crock pot. Pour the cheese sauce over the pasta and add the shredded cheddar cheese. Stir gently to combine.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook in the Crock Pot:</strong> Cover the crock pot and cook on low for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. The dish is ready when the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is creamy.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Once done, give the mac and cheese a final stir and serve hot. Garnish with fresh herbs or extra cheese if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free crock pot mac and cheese turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Pasta:</strong> Not all gluten-free pastas are created equal. Look for brands that hold their shape well and have a texture similar to traditional pasta.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can become mushy if overcooked. Always undercook it slightly before adding it to the crock pot.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Cheese:</strong> Pre-shredded cheese often contains anti-caking agents that can affect the texture of your sauce. Shred your cheese fresh for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir Occasionally:</strong> To prevent the pasta from sticking to the bottom of the crock pot, stir the mixture every 30-45 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
