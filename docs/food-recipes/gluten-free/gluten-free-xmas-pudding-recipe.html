    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by gathering all your ingredients. Ensure that your breadcrumbs and flour are certified gluten-free. If you're using dairy-free butter, make sure it's at room temperature for easier mixing.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free breadcrumbs, self-raising flour, mixed dried fruit, dark brown sugar, mixed spice, and ground cinnamon. Stir well to ensure an even distribution of ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, melted butter, brandy (or orange juice), and orange zest. Once combined, pour this mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir thoroughly until everything is well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Steam the Pudding</h3>
    <p>Grease a 1.2-liter pudding basin and pour the mixture into it. Cover the basin with a double layer of baking parchment and foil, securing it with string. Place the basin in a large pot with enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the basin. Cover the pot with a lid and steam the pudding for 4-5 hours, checking occasionally to ensure the water doesn't evaporate completely.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once steamed, remove the pudding from the pot and let it cool slightly before turning it out onto a serving plate. Serve warm with a dollop of brandy butter or custard for an extra festive touch.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this pudding ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! In fact, Christmas puddings often taste better when made a few weeks in advance. Simply store it in a cool, dry place and reheat by steaming for an hour before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use fresh fruit instead of dried fruit?</h3>
        <p>While dried fruit is traditional for Christmas pudding, you can experiment with fresh fruit. Just be aware that fresh fruit may alter the texture and moisture content of the pudding.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can be made vegan by substituting the eggs with a flaxseed or chia seed egg and using dairy-free butter. Ensure all other ingredients are vegan-friendly as well.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the pudding?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the pudding for up to three months. Wrap it tightly in cling film and foil before freezing. Thaw and reheat by steaming when ready to serve.</p>
