<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly and achieve the perfect texture.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Cream the Butter and Sugars</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This step is crucial for creating a soft and chewy cookie texture.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
<p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Then, mix in the vanilla extract. This adds moisture and flavor to your cookies.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free 1-to-1 Baking Flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Overmixing can lead to dense cookies, so be gentle.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Fold in Chocolate Chips</h3>
<p>Stir in the gluten-free chocolate chips until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough. You can also add nuts or other mix-ins if desired.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Scoop and Bake</h3>
<p>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may look slightly undercooked, but they will firm up as they cool.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your delicious gluten-free cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Ensure your butter and eggs are at room temperature for easier mixing and better texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Mix-Ins:</strong> Feel free to add nuts, dried fruit, or even white chocolate chips for variety.</li>
    <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Keep your cookies in an airtight container to maintain their freshness.</li>
</ul>
