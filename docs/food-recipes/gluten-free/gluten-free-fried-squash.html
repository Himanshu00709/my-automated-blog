    <p>Fried squash is a beloved dish in many households, offering a crispy, savory treat that pairs well with a variety of meals.

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Squash:</strong> Wash the squash thoroughly and slice it into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Pat them dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Create the Batter:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cornstarch, salt, pepper, and paprika (if using). In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and milk until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the Squash:</strong> Dip each squash round into the egg mixture, then coat it evenly with the flour mixture. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Squash:</strong> Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the coated squash rounds in the skillet. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Serve:</strong> Remove the fried squash from the skillet and place it on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil. Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauce or as a side dish.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Fried Squash</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Different gluten-free flours have unique textures and flavors. Almond flour adds a nutty taste, while chickpea flour provides a slightly earthy flavor. Experiment to find your favorite.</li>
        <li><strong>Control the Oil Temperature:</strong> If the oil is too hot, the squash will burn on the outside before cooking through. If it’s too cool, the squash will absorb too much oil and become greasy. Aim for a medium heat setting.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Seasonings:</strong> Feel free to customize the seasoning blend to suit your taste. Garlic powder, onion powder, or cayenne pepper can add an extra kick.</li>
    </ul>
