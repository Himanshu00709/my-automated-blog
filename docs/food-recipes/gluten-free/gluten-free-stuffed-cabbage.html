    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free stuffed cabbage:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Cabbage Leaves:</strong> Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Carefully remove the outer leaves of the cabbage and blanch them in the boiling water for 2-3 minutes until they are pliable. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Filling:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the ground meat, cooked quinoa or rice, chopped onion, minced garlic, and spices. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Stuffed Cabbage:</strong> Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each cabbage leaf. Fold the sides over the filling and roll the leaf tightly to enclose the filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Stuffed Cabbage:</strong> Arrange the stuffed cabbage rolls in a large pot or Dutch oven. Pour the tomato sauce over the rolls, ensuring they are fully covered. Simmer on low heat for 1-1.5 hours, or until the cabbage is tender and the filling is cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Serve the stuffed cabbage hot, garnished with fresh herbs if desired. Pair with a side salad or gluten-free bread for a complete meal.</li>
