    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Roux:</strong> In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the gluten-free flour and whisk continuously for about 1-2 minutes until the mixture is smooth and bubbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Milk:</strong> Gradually pour in the milk while whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Continue to cook and stir until the mixture thickens, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate the Cheese:</strong> Reduce the heat to low and add the shredded cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. Stir until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the Sauce:</strong> Add the diced green chilies, ground cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Remove the sauce from heat and serve immediately with your favorite gluten-free tortilla chips, nachos, or other dishes.</li>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Nacho Cheese Sauce</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free nacho cheese sauce turns out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Cheese:</strong> The quality of the cheese you use will significantly impact the flavor of your sauce. Opt for freshly shredded cheese rather than pre-shredded varieties, which often contain anti-caking agents that can affect the texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the Consistency:</strong> If your sauce is too thick, you can thin it out by adding a bit more milk. Conversely, if it’s too thin, let it simmer for a few more minutes to thicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to customize your sauce by adding other ingredients like jalapeños, garlic powder, or hot sauce for an extra kick.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> If you have leftovers, store the sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave, adding a splash of milk if needed to restore the creamy texture.</li>
    </ul>
