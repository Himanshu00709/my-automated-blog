<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your dish will bake evenly and develop a golden crust.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Potatoes</h3>
<p>Peel the potatoes and slice them thinly, about 1/8 inch thick. You can use a mandoline slicer for even slices, which will help the potatoes cook uniformly.</p>

<h3>3. Make the Cream Sauce</h3>
<p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant. Stir in the gluten-free flour and cook for another minute to create a roux. Gradually whisk in the heavy cream, ensuring there are no lumps. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg (if using). Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, then remove from heat.</p>

<h3>4. Layer the Potatoes and Sauce</h3>
<p>In a greased baking dish, arrange a layer of potato slices. Pour a portion of the cream sauce over the potatoes, then sprinkle with a layer of shredded cheese. Repeat the layers until all the potatoes and sauce are used, finishing with a layer of cheese on top.</p>

<h3>5. Bake the Dish</h3>
<p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.</p>

<h3>6. Let It Rest</h3>
<p>Allow the potato au gratin to rest for 10 minutes before serving. This helps the sauce thicken and makes it easier to slice.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Potato Au Gratin</h2>

<p>Gluten-free potato au gratin can be a nutritious addition to your diet, especially when made with wholesome ingredients. Potatoes are a good source of vitamins C and B6, potassium, and fiber. Using gluten-free flour and high-quality cheese adds protein and healthy fats to the dish. Additionally, by controlling the ingredients, you can reduce the amount of sodium and unhealthy additives often found in processed foods.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Potato Au Gratin</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use any cheese that melts well, such as mozzarella, Swiss, or even a blend of cheeses. Just make sure the cheese is gluten-free, as some processed cheeses may contain gluten.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I make this dish dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the heavy cream with a dairy-free alternative like coconut cream or almond milk. Use a dairy-free cheese or nutritional yeast for the cheesy flavor.</p>

    <h3>3. How do I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave until warmed through.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I freeze gluten-free potato au gratin?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the dish before baking. Assemble the layers in a freezer-safe dish, cover tightly with foil, and freeze for up to 2 months. When ready to bake, thaw in the refrigerator overnight and bake as directed.</p>
