    <h1>Gluten-Free Pigs in a Blanket: A Delicious Twist on a Classic</h1>
    <p>Pigs in a blanket are a beloved appetizer that has been a staple at parties, holiday gatherings, and game-day events for decades. Traditionally made with cocktail sausages wrapped in crescent roll dough, this bite-sized treat is a crowd-pleaser. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic snack can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free pigs in a blanket—a delicious and inclusive twist on the original that everyone can enjoy.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Pigs in a Blanket?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free pigs in a blanket are a variation of the traditional recipe, where the dough used to wrap the sausages is made without gluten-containing ingredients. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. By using gluten-free flour blends or pre-made gluten-free dough, you can recreate this classic snack without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>For many people, going gluten-free is not just a dietary choice but a necessity. Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder, requires a strict gluten-free diet to prevent damage to the small intestine. Additionally, some individuals may have non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which can cause symptoms like bloating, headaches, and fatigue. By offering gluten-free options like pigs in a blanket, you can ensure that everyone at your gathering can enjoy the festivities without worry.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Pigs in a Blanket</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free pigs in a blanket is surprisingly simple, and you can choose to make your own dough or use a store-bought gluten-free option. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating this delicious appetizer:</p>

    </table>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> Roll out the gluten-free dough on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Cut the dough into thin strips or triangles, depending on the shape of your dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Wrap the sausages:</strong> Place a cocktail sausage at the wide end of each dough strip and roll it up, ensuring the sausage is fully enclosed. Repeat with all sausages.</li>
        <li><strong>Add egg wash:</strong> Beat the egg in a small bowl and brush it over the wrapped sausages. This will give them a golden, shiny finish. Sprinkle with sesame or poppy seeds if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the pigs in a blanket on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the dough is golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Allow the pigs in a blanket to cool slightly before serving. They are best enjoyed warm!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pigs in a Blanket</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free pigs in a blanket turn out perfectly, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the right dough:</strong> Not all gluten-free doughs are created equal. Look for a brand that is known for its flaky, buttery texture, as this will closely mimic traditional crescent roll dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overfill:</strong> Be careful not to overfill the dough with sausages, as this can cause the dough to tear or not cook evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Add a sprinkle of cheese, herbs, or spices to the dough before wrapping the sausages for an extra flavor boost.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve with dipping sauces:</strong> Gluten-free pigs in a blanket pair wonderfully with mustard, ketchup, or even a spicy aioli for dipping.</li>
    </ul>
