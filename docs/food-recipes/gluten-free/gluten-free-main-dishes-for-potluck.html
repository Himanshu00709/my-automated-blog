<h1>Gluten-Free Main Dishes for Potluck: Delicious and Inclusive Options</h1>

<p>Potlucks are a fantastic way to bring people together, share delicious food, and enjoy a variety of dishes. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, navigating a potluck can be challenging.

In this blog post, we’ll explore some mouth-watering gluten-free main dishes that are perfect for potlucks, ensuring everyone can enjoy the feast without worry.</p>

<h2>Why Gluten-Free Matters</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the intestines. Even for those without gluten-related health concerns, gluten-free dishes can be a healthier option, often incorporating more whole, unprocessed ingredients. By including gluten-free main dishes at your potluck, you’re not only catering to dietary restrictions but also promoting a more inclusive and health-conscious gathering.</p>
