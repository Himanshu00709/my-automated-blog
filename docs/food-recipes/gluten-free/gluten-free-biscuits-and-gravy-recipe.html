<h1>Gluten-Free Biscuits and Gravy: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

<p>For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding comfort food that doesn't compromise on taste or texture can be a challenge.

<p>Gluten-free baking has come a long way in recent years, with a variety of flours and starches available that mimic the texture and taste of traditional wheat flour. This makes it easier than ever to recreate your favorite dishes without compromising on flavor or texture.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Gluten-Free Biscuits</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 450째F (230째C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

<p>Next, slowly add the milk (or non-dairy alternative) to the mixture, stirring until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough biscuits. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a few times. Roll the dough out to about 1/2 inch thickness and use a biscuit cutter to cut out your biscuits. Place the biscuits on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown.</p>

<h3>2. Making the Gluten-Free Gravy</h3>

<p>While the biscuits are baking, you can start on the gravy. In a large skillet, cook the ground sausage over medium heat until it's fully browned and cooked through. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside, leaving the drippings in the pan.</p>

<p>Add the gluten-free all-purpose flour to the skillet and whisk it into the sausage drippings. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, to create a roux. Slowly pour in the gluten-free chicken broth, whisking continuously to prevent lumps from forming. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until it thickens, about 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Stir in the heavy cream (or non-dairy alternative) and return the cooked sausage to the skillet. Season the gravy with black pepper to taste. Let it simmer for another 2-3 minutes, then remove from heat.</p>

<h3>3. Serving Your Gluten-Free Biscuits and Gravy</h3>

<p>Once the biscuits are done baking, split them in half and place them on a plate. Spoon the sausage gravy over the top of the biscuits, and serve immediately. This dish is best enjoyed fresh, but you can store any leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour for the biscuits?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as almond flour or coconut flour. However, keep in mind that these flours have different textures and may require adjustments to the recipe.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the milk and heavy cream with non-dairy alternatives like almond milk, coconut milk, or oat milk. Just make sure to choose unsweetened varieties to avoid altering the flavor of the dish.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover biscuits and gravy in separate airtight containers in the refrigerator. The biscuits can be reheated in the oven, while the gravy can be warmed up on the stovetop. Add a splash of broth or milk to the gravy if it thickens too much upon reheating.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze the biscuits?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked biscuits for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply place them in a preheated oven at 350째F (175째C) for 10-15 minutes, or until warmed through.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free biscuits and gravy is a comforting and satisfying dish that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and a little bit of patience, you can create a meal that's just as delicious as the traditional version. Whether you're new to gluten-free cooking or a seasoned pro, this recipe is sure to become a favorite in your household. So, roll up your sleeves, gather your ingredients, and get ready to enjoy a hearty, gluten-free breakfast that will leave you feeling full and satisfied.</p>
