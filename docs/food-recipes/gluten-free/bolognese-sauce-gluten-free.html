    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Bolognese Sauce</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free Bolognese sauce is straightforward, and the process is similar to making traditional Bolognese. The key is to ensure that all ingredients are gluten-free. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Vegetables</h3>

    <p>Start by finely chopping onions, carrots, and celery. These vegetables form the base of the sauce and add depth of flavor. Sauté them in olive oil until they are soft and fragrant.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Brown the Meat</h3>

    <p>Add your choice of ground meat (beef, pork, or a combination) to the pot. Cook until the meat is browned and no longer pink. Breaking up the meat into small pieces as it cooks will ensure a uniform texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Tomatoes and Seasonings</h3>

    <p>Once the meat is cooked, add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and any additional seasonings like garlic, oregano, and basil. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Simmer the Sauce</h3>

    <p>Pour in gluten-free stock and a splash of gluten-free wine (if using). Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer and let it cook for at least 30 minutes, or longer if you have the time. The longer the sauce simmers, the more the flavors will meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve with Gluten-Free Pasta</h3>

    <p>Once the sauce is ready, serve it over your favorite gluten-free pasta. Garnish with fresh basil or grated Parmesan cheese for an extra touch of flavor.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Bolognese</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh vegetables and high-quality meat will enhance the flavor of your sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Labels:</strong> Always double-check the labels of canned tomatoes, stock, and wine to ensure they are gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Herbs:</strong> Don’t be afraid to experiment with different herbs and spices to customize the flavor of your Bolognese.</li>
        <li><strong>Make It Ahead:</strong> Bolognese sauce tastes even better the next day, so consider making it ahead of time and reheating it when needed.</li>
    </ul>
