    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by combining the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Add the cold, cubed butter to the dry ingredients. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add cold water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Roll Out the Dough</h3>

    <p>Once the dough is formed, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This step is crucial as it allows the dough to firm up, making it easier to roll out. After chilling, roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) to about 1/8-inch thickness. Use a round cookie cutter or the rim of a glass to cut out small circles, similar to the size of Ritz crackers.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Crackers</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the cut-out dough circles on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Using a fork, gently prick each cracker a few times to prevent them from puffing up too much during baking. Brush the tops of the crackers with the beaten egg wash and sprinkle with sea salt flakes. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crackers are golden brown and crisp. Allow them to cool completely on a wire rack before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Ritz Crackers</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Ingredients:</strong> Keeping the butter and water cold ensures a flaky texture, similar to traditional Ritz crackers.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overwork the Dough:</strong> Overworking the dough can lead to tough crackers. Handle it as little as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add herbs, spices, or cheese to the dough for a unique twist on the classic cracker.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Keep the crackers in an airtight container to maintain their crispness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>While almond flour can be used, it will result in a different texture and flavor. For the best results, stick to a 1:1 gluten-free baking flour blend.</p>

        <h3>How long do these crackers stay fresh?</h3>
        <p>When stored in an airtight container, these gluten-free Ritz crackers can stay fresh for up to a week. For longer storage, consider freezing them.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these crackers dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. Just ensure it's cold when you incorporate it into the dough.</p>

        <h3>Are these crackers suitable for people with celiac disease?</h3>
        <p>Yes, as long as all the ingredients used are certified gluten-free, these crackers are safe for individuals with celiac disease.</p>
