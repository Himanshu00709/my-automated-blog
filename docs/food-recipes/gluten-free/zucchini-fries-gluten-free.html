    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Zucchini Fries</h2>
    <p>Making zucchini fries at home is surprisingly easy and requires just a few simple ingredients. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating this delicious snack:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium zucchinis</li>
        <li>1 cup gluten-free breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>Cooking spray or olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Cut the zucchinis into fry-like sticks, about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
        <li>In a shallow bowl, whisk the eggs. In another bowl, mix the gluten-free breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Dip each zucchini stick into the egg mixture, then coat it evenly with the breadcrumb mixture.</li>
        <li>Place the coated zucchini sticks on the prepared baking sheet, making sure they are not touching each other.</li>
        <li>Lightly spray the zucchini fries with cooking spray or drizzle with olive oil to help them crisp up in the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the fries are golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauce, such as marinara, ranch, or aioli.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Zucchini Fries</h2>
    <p>To ensure your zucchini fries turn out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dry the Zucchini:</strong> After cutting the zucchini into sticks, pat them dry with a paper towel. Excess moisture can prevent the coating from sticking properly.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Parchment Paper:</strong> Lining your baking sheet with parchment paper prevents the fries from sticking and makes cleanup easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overcrowd the Pan:</strong> Make sure the zucchini fries are spaced out on the baking sheet. Overcrowding can lead to steaming instead of crisping.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Seasonings:</strong> Feel free to customize the seasoning blend to suit your taste. Add herbs like oregano or thyme, or a pinch of cayenne for a spicy kick.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Zucchini Fries</h2>
    <div class="faq">

    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make zucchini fries without breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer a breadcrumb-free version, you can use almond flour, coconut flour, or crushed gluten-free crackers as a coating. You can also simply season the zucchini sticks with spices and bake them without any coating for a lighter option.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I freeze zucchini fries?</h3>

When ready to cook, bake them directly from frozen, adding a few extra minutes to the cooking time.</p>
    </div>
