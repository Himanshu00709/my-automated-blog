    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get cooking! Follow these steps to create a mouthwatering gluten-free Mongolian beef dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Beef</h3>
    <p>Start by thinly slicing the beef against the grain. This ensures that the meat remains tender when cooked. Once sliced, toss the beef in cornstarch until evenly coated. This step helps to create a crispy exterior when the beef is fried.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine the gluten-free soy sauce or tamari with brown sugar, minced garlic, grated ginger, and red pepper flakes (if using). Stir until the sugar is fully dissolved. This sauce will be the base of your dish, providing the perfect balance of sweet and savory flavors.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Beef</h3>
    <p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the coated beef slices in a single layer. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side until the beef is browned and crispy. Remove the beef from the skillet and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine and Simmer</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the prepared sauce and bring it to a simmer. Allow the sauce to thicken slightly, then return the cooked beef to the skillet. Toss the beef in the sauce until it’s fully coated and heated through.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Finally, garnish your gluten-free Mongolian beef with chopped green onions and sesame seeds. Serve it over steamed rice or gluten-free noodles for a complete meal. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute beef with chicken, pork, or even tofu for a vegetarian option. Adjust the cooking time accordingly to ensure the meat is fully cooked.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for meal prep?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Gluten-free Mongolian beef can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat it in a skillet or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of cornstarch?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use cornstarch, you can substitute it with arrowroot powder or tapioca starch. Both work well as gluten-free thickeners.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish spicier?</h3>
        <p>Yes, if you enjoy a bit of heat, you can increase the amount of red pepper flakes or add a dash of sriracha sauce to the sauce mixture.</p>
    </div>

With simple substitutions and easy-to-follow steps, you can create a meal that’s both delicious and safe for those with gluten sensitivities.
