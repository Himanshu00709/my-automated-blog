    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Meat Sauce</h3>

    <p>Start by browning the ground beef or turkey in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the meat is fully cooked, drain any excess fat and return it to the skillet. Add the marinara sauce, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine and let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes. This will allow the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Cheese Mixture</h3>

    <p>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and half of the grated Parmesan cheese. Mix until well combined. This mixture will add a creamy texture to your lasagna and help bind the layers together.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Layer the Ingredients in the Slow Cooker</h3>

    <p>Now it’s time to assemble the lasagna. Begin by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of the slow cooker. This will prevent the noodles from sticking. Next, add a layer of gluten-free lasagna noodles, breaking them if necessary to fit the shape of your slow cooker. Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat these layers until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Lasagna</h3>

    <p>Cover the slow cooker and set it to cook on low for 4-6 hours or on high for 2-3 hours. The exact cooking time may vary depending on your slow cooker, so it’s a good idea to check the lasagna after a few hours to ensure the noodles are tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once the lasagna is cooked, turn off the slow cooker and let it sit for about 10 minutes before serving. This will allow the lasagna to set slightly, making it easier to slice. Serve with a side salad or garlic bread for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free pasta?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other types of gluten-free pasta, but keep in mind that the cooking time may vary. Lasagna noodles are specifically designed to hold up well in layered dishes, so they are the best choice for this recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this lasagna vegetarian?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply omit the ground meat and add more vegetables, such as spinach, zucchini, or mushrooms, to the sauce. You can also use a plant-based meat substitute if you prefer.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftover lasagna can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply microwave individual portions or warm them in the oven at 350°F until heated through.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this lasagna?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this lasagna freezes well. Allow it to cool completely, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before placing it in the freezer. It can be stored for up to 3 months. To reheat, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and then bake at 350°F until heated through.</p>
