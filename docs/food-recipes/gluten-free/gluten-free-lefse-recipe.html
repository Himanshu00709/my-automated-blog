Made primarily from potatoes, flour, and butter, this soft, delicate bread is often enjoyed during holidays and special occasions. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional lefse can be off-limits due to its wheat flour content.

Lefse is often associated with festive occasions, particularly Christmas, and is a cherished part of Norwegian culinary heritage.</p>

<h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

Additionally, gluten-free diets have gained popularity among those seeking to reduce inflammation or improve overall well-being, making this recipe a great option for a wider audience.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Potatoes:</strong> Peel and boil the potatoes until tender. Mash them thoroughly until smooth, ensuring there are no lumps.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, gluten-free flour, melted butter, salt, and milk. Mix until a soft dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a bit more gluten-free flour.</li>
    <li><strong>Rest the Dough:</strong> Cover the dough and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. This allows the flour to absorb moisture and makes the dough easier to handle.</li>
    <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Divide the dough into small balls (about the size of a golf ball). On a floured surface, roll each ball out into a thin circle, about 1/8 inch thick. Use additional gluten-free flour as needed to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the Lefse:</strong> Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat. Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough to the griddle and cook for about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until lightly browned and cooked through.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once cooked, stack the lefse on a plate and cover with a clean kitchen towel to keep them warm and soft. Serve with your favorite toppings, such as butter, sugar, or cinnamon.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Lefse</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten. Popular options include blends made from rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep the Dough Moist:</strong> Gluten-free dough can dry out quickly, so be sure to cover it while resting and work quickly when rolling it out.</li>
    <li><strong>Use a Lefse Stick:</strong> A lefse stick is a traditional tool used to transfer the delicate dough to the griddle. If you don’t have one, a long, thin spatula can work in a pinch.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> While traditional lefse is often served with sweet toppings, don’t be afraid to get creative. Try savory options like cream cheese and smoked salmon for a unique twist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Lefse</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use any type of potato for gluten-free lefse?</h3>
    <p>Russet potatoes are the best choice for lefse due to their high starch content, which helps create a smooth, pliable dough. However, you can experiment with other varieties, such as Yukon Gold, if desired.</p>

    <h3>Can I make gluten-free lefse ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, gluten-free lefse can be made ahead of time and stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, freeze the lefse between layers of parchment paper and reheat as needed.</p>

    <h3>What’s the best way to reheat gluten-free lefse?</h3>
    <p>To reheat gluten-free lefse, wrap it in a damp paper towel and microwave for 10-15 seconds, or warm it briefly on a griddle. This helps restore its softness and flexibility.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a gluten-free flour blend that doesn’t contain xanthan gum?</h3>
    <p>While you can use a blend without xanthan gum, the dough may be more fragile and harder to roll out. If your blend doesn’t include xanthan gum, consider adding 1/2 teaspoon to the recipe to improve texture.</p>
</div>
