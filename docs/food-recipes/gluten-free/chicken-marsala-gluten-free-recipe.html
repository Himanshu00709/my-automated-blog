<h2>Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
<p>Start by preparing the chicken breasts. Place them between two sheets of plastic wrap and gently pound them to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch. This ensures even cooking. Season both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Coat the Chicken with Gluten-Free Flour</h3>
<p>In a shallow dish, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour with a pinch of salt and pepper. Dredge each chicken breast in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess. This step helps to create a light crust on the chicken and thicken the sauce later.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cook the Chicken</h3>
<p>Heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter has melted and the oil is hot, add the chicken breasts. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside on a plate.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Sauté the Mushrooms and Shallots</h3>
<p>In the same skillet, add the remaining tablespoon of butter. Once melted, add the sliced mushrooms and minced shallots. Sauté for about 5-7 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender and the shallots are translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, stirring frequently to prevent burning.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Deglaze with Marsala Wine</h3>
<p>Pour the Marsala wine into the skillet, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Allow the wine to simmer and reduce by half, which should take about 5 minutes. This step is crucial for developing the deep, rich flavor of the sauce.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Add Chicken Broth and Cream</h3>
<p>Stir in the gluten-free chicken broth and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for another 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Finally, stir in the heavy cream and return the chicken breasts to the skillet. Simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the chicken is heated through and the sauce has thickened slightly.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Garnish and Serve</h3>
<p>Remove the skillet from the heat and sprinkle the dish with freshly chopped parsley. Serve the Chicken Marsala hot, accompanied by your favorite gluten-free pasta, mashed potatoes, or steamed vegetables.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chicken Marsala</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flour alternatives such as almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free baking mix. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly depending on the flour you choose.</p>

    <h3>Is Marsala wine gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Most Marsala wines are naturally gluten-free, but it’s always a good idea to check the label or contact the manufacturer to ensure there are no added ingredients that contain gluten.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this dish dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like olive oil or coconut oil, and replace the heavy cream with a dairy-free cream or coconut milk. The flavor will be slightly different, but still delicious.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave, adding a splash of chicken broth if the sauce has thickened too much.</p>
