    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your own gluten-free sweet potato pancakes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sweet Potato:</strong> Start by cooking the sweet potato. You can either bake it in the oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 45 minutes or microwave it for 5-7 minutes until soft. Once cooked, peel and mash the sweet potato until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, almond milk, and vanilla extract. Add the mashed sweet potato and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pancakes:</strong> Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with coconut oil. Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as fresh fruit, maple syrup, or a dollop of yogurt.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Sweet Potato Pancakes</h2>
    <p>Sweet potato pancakes are not only delicious but also offer a range of health benefits. Here are some of the key nutritional advantages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rich in Vitamins:</strong> Sweet potatoes are an excellent source of vitamin A, which is essential for eye health, and vitamin C, which supports the immune system.</li>
        <li><strong>High in Fiber:</strong> The fiber content in sweet potatoes helps promote digestive health and keeps you feeling full longer, making these pancakes a great option for weight management.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free:</strong> By using gluten-free flours, these pancakes are suitable for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Glycemic Index:</strong> Sweet potatoes have a lower glycemic index compared to regular potatoes, meaning they release sugar into the bloodstream more slowly, helping to maintain stable blood sugar levels.</li>
    </ul>
