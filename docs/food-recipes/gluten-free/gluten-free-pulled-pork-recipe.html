<h2>Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pork</h3>

<p>Start by trimming any excess fat from the pork shoulder. While some fat is necessary for flavor and moisture, too much can make the dish greasy. Once trimmed, pat the pork dry with paper towels. This will help the seasoning stick better.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Season the Pork</h3>

<p>In a small bowl, mix together the paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Rub this seasoning mixture all over the pork, ensuring that it’s evenly coated. Let the pork sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Sear the Pork</h3>

<p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, sear the pork on all sides until it’s nicely browned. This step is crucial for locking in the juices and adding depth of flavor to the final dish.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Slow Cook the Pork</h3>

<p>Transfer the seared pork to a slow cooker. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free BBQ sauce, apple cider vinegar, and brown sugar. Pour this mixture over the pork in the slow cooker. Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours or on high for 4-6 hours. The pork should be tender enough to shred easily with a fork.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Shred and Serve</h3>

<p>Once the pork is cooked, remove it from the slow cooker and place it on a cutting board. Use two forks to shred the meat into bite-sized pieces. Return the shredded pork to the slow cooker and mix it with the cooking juices. Let it sit for an additional 15-20 minutes to absorb the flavors. Serve the pulled pork on gluten-free buns, over rice, or with your favorite sides.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pulled Pork</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different cut of pork?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use pork butt or even pork loin, but keep in mind that pork shoulder is the most flavorful and tender option for pulled pork.</p>

    <h3>2. How do I know if my BBQ sauce is gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Always check the label for gluten-free certification or look for sauces that are free from wheat, barley, and rye. Many brands now offer gluten-free options.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make this recipe in an Instant Pot?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can use the sauté function to sear the pork, then pressure cook it on high for about 90 minutes. Follow the same steps for shredding and serving.</p>

    <h3>4. What are some good gluten-free sides to serve with pulled pork?</h3>
    <p>Some great options include coleslaw, roasted vegetables, gluten-free cornbread, or a fresh green salad.</p>
