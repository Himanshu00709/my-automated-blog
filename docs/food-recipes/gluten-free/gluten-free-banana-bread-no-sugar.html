    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to make your gluten-free, no-sugar banana bread:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a loaf pan with a little oil or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash the bananas:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. The riper the bananas, the sweeter your bread will be.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix wet ingredients:</strong> Add the eggs, unsweetened applesauce, and vanilla extract to the mashed bananas. Mix well until combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free, no-sugar banana bread is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Bananas are a great source of potassium, vitamin C, and dietary fiber. Gluten-free flours like almond flour or oat flour provide healthy fats and protein, making this bread a more nutrient-dense option compared to traditional recipes. Additionally, by avoiding refined sugars, you’re reducing empty calories and promoting better blood sugar control.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or a gluten-free all-purpose blend. Keep in mind that different flours may absorb moisture differently, so you may need to adjust the quantity of wet ingredients slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or chocolate chips?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Adding nuts like walnuts or pecans can provide a nice crunch, while sugar-free chocolate chips can add a touch of indulgence. Just be mindful of the additional calories and adjust accordingly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the banana bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the banana bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months. Simply wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer-safe bag.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe uses eggs, so it’s not vegan. However, you can try substituting the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) for a vegan-friendly version.</p>
