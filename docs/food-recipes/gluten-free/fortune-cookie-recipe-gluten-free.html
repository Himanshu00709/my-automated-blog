    <h1>Gluten-Free Fortune Cookie Recipe: A Delicious and Inclusive Treat</h1>

    <p>Fortune cookies are a beloved treat often associated with Chinese cuisine, though their origins are debated. These crispy, sweet cookies with a hidden message inside are a fun and interactive way to end a meal. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, traditional fortune cookies are off the menu due to their wheat-based ingredients. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can create gluten-free fortune cookies that are just as delightful and inclusive for everyone to enjoy.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Fortune Cookies?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular as more people are diagnosed with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and other health problems for those with these conditions. By using gluten-free flours and other alternative ingredients, you can create fortune cookies that are safe and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Fortune Cookies</h2>

    <p>To make gluten-free fortune cookies, you'll need the following ingredients:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Quantity</th>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Granulated sugar</td>
                <td>1/2 cup</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Vanilla extract</td>
                <td>1/2 tsp</td>
                <td>Optional, for added flavor.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free fortune cookies:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, sugar, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy, then add the vanilla extract and water. Gradually combine the wet and dry ingredients, stirring until you achieve a smooth, thin batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a tablespoon, drop small amounts of batter onto the prepared baking sheet, spreading them into thin, even circles. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Shape the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Immediately after removing the cookies from the oven, place a fortune message in the center of each circle. Fold the cookie in half, then gently bend it over the edge of a cup or bowl to create the classic fortune cookie shape. Hold for a few seconds to set the shape.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool completely on a wire rack before serving. Store in an airtight container to maintain their crispiness.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Fortune Cookies</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a reliable gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that is specifically designed for baking and contains xanthan gum for elasticity.</li>
        <li><strong>Work quickly:</strong> Fortune cookies harden fast, so you need to shape them immediately after removing them from the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice makes perfect:</strong> Shaping fortune cookies can be tricky at first. Don’t be discouraged if your first few attempts aren’t perfect.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour can be used, but it will result in a denser cookie. For the best texture, stick to a gluten-free flour blend designed for baking.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How long do gluten-free fortune cookies last?</h3>

    </div>
