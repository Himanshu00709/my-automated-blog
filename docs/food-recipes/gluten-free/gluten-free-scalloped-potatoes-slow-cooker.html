    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Start by washing and peeling the potatoes. Slice them thinly (about 1/8-inch thick) using a sharp knife or a mandoline slicer. Uniform slices ensure even cooking. If you’re not ready to cook immediately, place the sliced potatoes in a bowl of cold water to prevent browning.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Gluten-Free Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the gluten-free flour and whisk continuously to create a roux. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the mixture is smooth and slightly golden. Gradually add the milk and heavy cream, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Stir in the minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook until the sauce thickens, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Layer the Potatoes and Sauce</h3>
    <p>Grease the inside of your slow cooker with butter or cooking spray. Layer half of the sliced potatoes at the bottom, followed by half of the sauce. Repeat with the remaining potatoes and sauce. If using cheese, sprinkle it evenly over the top layer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook in the Slow Cooker</h3>
    <p>Cover the slow cooker and cook on low for 6-7 hours or on high for 3-4 hours. The potatoes should be tender, and the sauce should be bubbly and creamy. Avoid opening the lid frequently, as this can slow down the cooking process.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once cooked, garnish with fresh thyme or parsley for a pop of color and flavor. Serve warm as a side dish or a main course. Pair it with roasted vegetables, grilled chicken, or a fresh salad for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Scalloped Potatoes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Potatoes:</strong> Yukon Gold or Russet potatoes work best due to their starch content, which helps create a creamy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh garlic and herbs enhance the flavor significantly compared to dried alternatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Cooking Time:</strong> Slow cookers vary, so check the potatoes for doneness towards the end of the cooking time.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Cheese:</strong> Try different cheeses like Gruyère, Parmesan, or a dairy-free alternative for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Substitute the milk and heavy cream with dairy-free alternatives like almond milk, coconut milk, or oat milk. Use vegan butter and skip the cheese or use a dairy-free cheese option.</p>

        <h3>Can I prepare this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. You can assemble the layers in the slow cooker insert, cover it, and refrigerate overnight. When ready to cook, place the insert in the slow cooker and follow the cooking instructions.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave or oven until warmed through.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free scalloped potatoes?</h3>
        <p>Freezing is not recommended, as the creamy sauce may separate upon thawing, affecting the texture.</p>
