    <h2>Classic Gluten-Free Risotto Recipe</h2>

    <p>Here’s a simple yet delicious recipe for classic gluten-free risotto:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</li>
        <li>4 cups gluten-free chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine (ensure it's gluten-free)</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil or butter</li>

        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

    <ol>

    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use other types of rice for gluten-free risotto?</h3>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I store leftover risotto?</h3>
