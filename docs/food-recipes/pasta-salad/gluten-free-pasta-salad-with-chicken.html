    <h1>Gluten-Free Pasta Salad with Chicken: A Healthy and Delicious Meal</h1>
    <p>In recent years, gluten-free diets have gained popularity, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also among health-conscious individuals looking to improve their overall well-being. One dish that has become a staple in gluten-free cooking is the pasta salad.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Pasta</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gluten-free pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Be careful not to overcook, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy. Once cooked, drain and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>If you don’t have pre-cooked chicken, season chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and your favorite herbs. Grill or bake until fully cooked, then shred or dice into bite-sized pieces.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Chop the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>While the pasta and chicken are cooking, prepare the vegetables. Halve the cherry tomatoes, dice the cucumber, finely chop the red onion, and slice the Kalamata olives. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Make the Dressing</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Assemble the Salad</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta, chicken, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, olives, and crumbled feta cheese. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine. Sprinkle with fresh parsley for added flavor and color.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Transfer the salad to a serving dish or individual bowls. This dish can be served immediately or chilled in the refrigerator for an hour to allow the flavors to meld together. It’s perfect for meal prep, picnics, or potlucks!</p>
