    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten and dairy-free pasta salad:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Pasta</h3>
    <p>Start by cooking the gluten-free pasta according to the package instructions. Be sure to cook it al dente, as overcooked pasta can become mushy when mixed with the other ingredients. Once cooked, drain the pasta and rinse it under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set it aside to cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>While the pasta is cooling, prepare the vegetables. Wash and chop the cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, bell pepper, and Kalamata olives. Finely chop the fresh parsley and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Dressing</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. This simple dressing will add a tangy and flavorful kick to your pasta salad.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooled pasta, chopped vegetables, and Kalamata olives. Pour the dressing over the mixture and toss everything together until well combined. Add the chopped parsley and give it one final toss.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>For the best flavor, cover the pasta salad and let it chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld together. Serve cold as a refreshing side dish or a light main course.</p>
