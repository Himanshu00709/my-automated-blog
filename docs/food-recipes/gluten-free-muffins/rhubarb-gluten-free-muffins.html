    <h1>Rhubarb Gluten-Free Muffins: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>Rhubarb is a versatile and tangy vegetable that has been used in baking for centuries. When combined with gluten-free ingredients, it transforms into a delightful treat that is not only delicious but also suitable for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.

    <h2>Why Rhubarb?</h2>

    <p>Rhubarb is a unique vegetable that is often used in desserts due to its tart flavor. It is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, making it a healthy addition to any diet. Rhubarb is particularly high in vitamin K, which is essential for bone health, and vitamin C, which supports the immune system. Additionally, rhubarb is low in calories and contains dietary fiber, which aids in digestion.</p>

By using gluten-free flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend, you can create muffins that are safe for those who need to avoid gluten. Additionally, gluten-free muffins can be lower in carbohydrates and higher in protein, depending on the flours used.</p>

    <p>Here are some of the health benefits of gluten-free muffins:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Digestion:</strong> Gluten-free flours are often easier to digest, especially for those with gluten sensitivities.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich in Nutrients:</strong> Many gluten-free flours, such as almond and coconut flour, are rich in vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower Glycemic Index:</strong> Gluten-free muffins made with low-carb flours can have a lower glycemic index, making them a better option for blood sugar control.</li>
