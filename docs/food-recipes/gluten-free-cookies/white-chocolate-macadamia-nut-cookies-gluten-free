    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free white chocolate macadamia nut cookies:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the Butter and Sugars:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Ensure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in White Chocolate and Macadamia Nuts:</strong> Gently fold in the white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts using a spatula.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and Bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies</h2>

    <p>While cookies are generally considered a treat, gluten-free white chocolate macadamia nut cookies can offer some nutritional benefits, especially when made with high-quality ingredients. Macadamia nuts are rich in monounsaturated fats, which are heart-healthy fats that can help reduce bad cholesterol levels. They also contain essential vitamins and minerals such as vitamin B1, magnesium, and manganese.</p>

    <p>White chocolate, when made with real cocoa butter, provides a source of antioxidants and can be a good source of calcium. However, it’s important to choose high-quality white chocolate that doesn’t contain artificial additives or excessive sugar.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>While almond flour can be used in gluten-free baking, it has a different texture and moisture content compared to a gluten-free flour blend. For best results, stick to a gluten-free flour blend that includes xanthan gum for proper binding.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. Additionally, ensure that the white chocolate chips you use are dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>4. Are macadamia nuts necessary?</h3>
        <p>While macadamia nuts add a unique flavor and texture, you can substitute them with other nuts like almonds or pecans if desired.</p>
    </div>
