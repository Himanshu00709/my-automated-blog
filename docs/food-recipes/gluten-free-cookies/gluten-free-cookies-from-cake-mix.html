    <h1>Gluten-Free Cookies from Cake Mix: A Delicious and Easy Guide</h1>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular as more people discover the benefits of a gluten-free diet, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference. One of the easiest and most versatile ways to create gluten-free treats is by using gluten-free cake mix as a base. In this article, we’ll explore how to make delicious gluten-free cookies using cake mix, along with tips, variations, and answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>Why Use Gluten-Free Cake Mix for Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free cake mix is a fantastic shortcut for baking. It’s pre-measured, pre-mixed, and often includes the perfect blend of gluten-free flours and starches to mimic the texture of traditional baked goods. When used to make cookies, cake mix provides a soft, chewy texture that’s hard to achieve with homemade gluten-free flour blends. Plus, it saves time and reduces the risk of cross-contamination in your kitchen.</p>

    <h2>Basic Recipe for Gluten-Free Cookies from Cake Mix</h2>
    <p>Here’s a simple recipe to get you started. You can customize it with your favorite add-ins like chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruit.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Ingredient</th>
            <th>Quantity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Gluten-free cake mix</td>
            <td>1 box (approx. 15-16 oz)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Eggs</td>
            <td>2 large</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Butter or oil</td>
            <td>1/2 cup (melted)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Vanilla extract</td>
            <td>1 teaspoon</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Add-ins (e.g., chocolate chips)</td>
            <td>1 cup (optional)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free cake mix, eggs, melted butter or oil, and vanilla extract. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>If using add-ins, fold them into the dough until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The cookies will continue to set as they cool.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free cookies from cake mix is easy, but a few tips can help you achieve the best results:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Cake Mix:</strong> Not all gluten-free cake mixes are created equal. Look for one with a fine texture and good reviews for baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Gluten-free cookies are a blank canvas. Try adding nuts, dried fruit, or even sprinkles for a fun twist.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Baking Time:</strong> Ovens vary, so keep an eye on your cookies. They’re done when the edges are golden but the centers are still soft.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Variations to Try</h2>
    <p>Once you’ve mastered the basic recipe, you can experiment with different flavors and textures. Here are a few ideas:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Variation</th>
            <th>Ingredients to Add</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Chocolate Chip Cookies</td>
            <td>1 cup chocolate chips</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Oatmeal Raisin Cookies</td>
            <td>1/2 cup gluten-free oats, 1/2 cup raisins</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Peanut Butter Cookies</td>
            <td>1/2 cup peanut butter, 1/2 cup chopped peanuts</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Lemon Cookies</td>
            <td>Zest of 1 lemon, 1 tablespoon lemon juice</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
