    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free cream cheese cookies:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you're ready to bake the cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cream the Butter and Cream Cheese</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the softened cream cheese and butter. Use an electric mixer to beat them together until they are smooth and creamy. This step is crucial for achieving the perfect texture in your cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Sugar and Egg</h3>
    <p>Next, add the granulated sugar to the cream cheese and butter mixture. Beat until the sugar is fully incorporated. Then, add the egg and vanilla extract, and continue to mix until the batter is smooth and well-combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing on low speed until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Shape the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Make sure to space the cookies about 2 inches apart to allow for spreading during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are lightly golden. The centers should still be soft when you take them out of the oven, as they will continue to cook slightly on the baking sheet.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your delicious gluten-free cream cheese cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cream Cheese Cookies</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, such as almond flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor of the cookies may vary depending on the type of flour you use.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>To make these cookies dairy-free, you can substitute the cream cheese and butter with dairy-free alternatives. Look for vegan cream cheese and plant-based butter at your local grocery store.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 2 months. Just make sure to thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add mix-ins to the dough?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Feel free to add chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruit to the dough for extra flavor and texture. Just be sure to fold them in gently after the dough has formed.</p>
