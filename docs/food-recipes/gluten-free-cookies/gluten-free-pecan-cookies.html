    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free pecan cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly and achieve the perfect texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter (or coconut oil) and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Pecans:</strong> Fold in the chopped pecans, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Cookies:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Leave enough space between each cookie to allow for spreading.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may still look slightly soft, but they will firm up as they cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

Additionally, gluten-free flours, such as almond or oat flour, provide a good amount of fiber and protein, making these cookies a more nutritious option compared to traditional cookies made with refined flour.</p>
