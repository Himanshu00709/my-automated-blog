    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your own batch of gluten-free Almond Joy cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the almond flour, shredded coconut, sugar, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg and vanilla extract. Pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate Chocolate and Almonds:</strong> Fold in the dark chocolate chips and whole almonds into the dough. Make sure they are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Cookies:</strong> Scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of the dough and roll them into balls. Place them on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Allow them to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Almond Joy Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh almond flour and shredded coconut will yield the best results. Stale ingredients can affect the texture and flavor of the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky to handle, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before forming the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Chocolate:</strong> Feel free to use milk chocolate or white chocolate chips instead of dark chocolate for a different flavor profile.</li>
    </ul>
