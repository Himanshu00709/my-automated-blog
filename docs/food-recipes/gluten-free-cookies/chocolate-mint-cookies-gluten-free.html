    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create the perfect gluten-free chocolate mint cookies:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly and achieve the perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. This ensures that all the dry ingredients are evenly distributed, which is crucial for consistent baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This step is essential for creating a soft and chewy cookie texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Egg and Peppermint Extract</h3>
    <p>Beat in the egg and peppermint extract until well combined. The peppermint extract will give your cookies that refreshing mint flavor that pairs perfectly with the chocolate.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to tough cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in the Chocolate Chips</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the chocolate chips until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough. This ensures that every bite of your cookie is packed with chocolatey goodness.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Space them about 2 inches apart to allow for spreading. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your delicious gluten-free chocolate mint cookies!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chocolate Mint Cookies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with coconut oil and use a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) instead of a regular egg. Make sure to use vegan chocolate chips as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store your gluten-free chocolate mint cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months for longer storage.</p>
