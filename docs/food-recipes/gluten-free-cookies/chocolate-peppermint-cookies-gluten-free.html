    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making these delightful cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and peppermint extract, and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Fold in the dark chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Cookies:</strong> Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of dough and roll them into balls. Place them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving enough space between each cookie.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft. Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle with crushed peppermint candies.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Chocolate Peppermint Cookies</h2>
    <p>While cookies are generally considered a treat, gluten-free chocolate peppermint cookies can offer some health benefits, especially when made with high-quality ingredients. Here are a few benefits:</p>

        <li><strong>Rich in Antioxidants:</strong> Dark chocolate is known for its high antioxidant content, which can help reduce inflammation and improve heart health.</li>
        <li><strong>Digestive Health:</strong> Gluten-free flours, such as almond or coconut flour, are often easier to digest and can be gentler on the stomach.</li>
        <li><strong>Mood Booster:</strong> The combination of chocolate and peppermint can have a mood-enhancing effect, making these cookies a perfect pick-me-up during the holiday season.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or oat flour. However, the texture and taste may vary slightly, so it’s best to experiment and find the blend that works best for you.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) instead of a regular egg.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use peppermint oil instead of extract?</h3>
        <p>Yes, but be cautious with the amount. Peppermint oil is much more concentrated than extract, so you’ll only need a few drops to achieve the desired flavor.</p>
