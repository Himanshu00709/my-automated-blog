    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the recipe:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cream the Butter and Cream Cheese</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and butter together until smooth and creamy. This should take about 2-3 minutes using an electric mixer on medium speed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Sugar and Egg</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the granulated sugar to the cream cheese and butter mixture, beating until well combined. Then, add the egg and vanilla extract, and continue to mix until the batter is smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix the dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The cookies will be soft in the center but will firm up as they cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your delicious gluten-free cream cheese cookies!</p>
