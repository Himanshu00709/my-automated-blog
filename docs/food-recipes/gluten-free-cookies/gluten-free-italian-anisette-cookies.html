    <h1>Gluten-Free Italian Anisette Cookies: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Italian Anisette Cookies are a classic dessert that has been enjoyed for generations. These soft, aromatic cookies are traditionally made with anise flavoring, giving them a unique and delightful taste. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying these cookies can be a challenge. That's where gluten-free Italian Anisette Cookies come in! In this blog post, we'll explore everything you need to know about making and enjoying these delicious gluten-free treats.</p>

    <h2>The History of Italian Anisette Cookies</h2>

    <p>Italian Anisette Cookies have a rich history that dates back to ancient times. Anise, the key flavoring in these cookies, has been used in Mediterranean cuisine for centuries. The cookies themselves are believed to have originated in Southern Italy, where they were often made for special occasions and holidays. Over time, the recipe spread throughout Italy and eventually made its way to other parts of the world, including the United States, where it became a staple in Italian-American households.</p>

    <p>Traditionally, these cookies are made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets, many bakers have adapted the recipe to accommodate those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. The result is a gluten-free version of the classic Italian Anisette Cookie that is just as delicious and satisfying as the original.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free Italian Anisette Cookies:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Anise</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, mix in the anise extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. Add the milk and mix until the dough comes together.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Shape the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, scoop out portions of dough and roll them into balls. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake, as the cookies should remain soft.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Glaze</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, prepare the glaze by mixing powdered sugar with water until smooth. Dip the top of each cookie into the glaze and add sprinkles if desired.</p>
