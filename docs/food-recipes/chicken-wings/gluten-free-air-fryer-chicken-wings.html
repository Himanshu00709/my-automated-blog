Enter the air fryer—a kitchen gadget that has revolutionized the way we cook. In this blog post, we’ll explore how to make gluten-free air fryer chicken wings that are crispy, flavorful, and healthier than traditional fried wings. Whether you’re hosting a game day party or simply craving a tasty treat, this recipe is sure to impress.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Air Fryer Chicken Wings?</h2>
    <p>Air fryers have gained immense popularity for their ability to create crispy, fried-like textures with minimal oil. This makes them an excellent choice for those looking to enjoy healthier versions of their favorite fried foods. For gluten-free eaters, air fryers offer an added benefit: they eliminate the risk of cross-contamination that can occur in shared fryers. Plus, air fryers are incredibly easy to use and clean, making them a convenient option for busy households.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Air Fryer Chicken Wings</h2>
    <p>To make gluten-free air fryer chicken wings, you’ll need the following ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs of chicken wings (split into drumettes and flats)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil or avocado oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for a spicy kick)</li>
        <li>Gluten-free sauce of your choice (e.g., buffalo, BBQ, or honey garlic)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create perfectly crispy gluten-free air fryer chicken wings:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Wings:</strong> Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This step is crucial for achieving a crispy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the Wings:</strong> In a large bowl, toss the wings with olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, black pepper, salt, and cayenne pepper (if using). Ensure the wings are evenly coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Air Fryer:</strong> Preheat your air fryer to 400°F (200°C) for about 3-5 minutes. Preheating helps to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Wings:</strong> Place the wings in the air fryer basket in a single layer, ensuring they are not overcrowded. Cook for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the wings are golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Toss in Sauce:</strong> Once the wings are cooked, toss them in your favorite gluten-free sauce. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
