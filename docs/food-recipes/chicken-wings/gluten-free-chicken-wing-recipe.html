    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken Wings</h3>
    <p>Start by patting the chicken wings dry with paper towels. This step is crucial for achieving crispy wings. If the wings are too wet, the coating won’t adhere properly, and they won’t crisp up as well in the oven or air fryer.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Create the Gluten-Free Coating</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, salt, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. Mix well to ensure the spices are evenly distributed. The baking powder helps create a light and crispy texture, while the spices add depth of flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Coat the Wings</h3>
    <p>Toss the chicken wings in the flour mixture, making sure each wing is evenly coated. For extra crispiness, you can let the coated wings sit in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before cooking. This step allows the coating to adhere better and results in a crunchier texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Wings</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) or your air fryer to 375°F (190°C). Arrange the wings on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or in the air fryer basket. Drizzle or spray the wings with olive oil or avocado oil to help them crisp up. Bake in the oven for 40-45 minutes, flipping halfway through, or air fry for 20-25 minutes, shaking the basket occasionally.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Prepare the Sauce (Optional)</h3>
    <p>If you prefer saucy wings, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan and mix it with 1/2 cup of gluten-free hot sauce. Toss the cooked wings in the sauce until evenly coated. Serve immediately for the best flavor and texture.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Chicken Wings</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a wire rack:</strong> Placing the wings on a wire rack over a baking sheet allows air to circulate around them, resulting in even crispiness.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flours:</strong> Different gluten-free flours (e.g., almond flour, rice flour, or chickpea flour) can yield slightly different textures. Choose one that suits your preference.</li>
        <li><strong>Double-coat for extra crunch:</strong> For an even crispier coating, dip the wings in beaten egg before tossing them in the flour mixture, then repeat the process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chicken Wings</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use frozen chicken wings?</h3>
        <p>Yes, but make sure to thaw them completely and pat them dry before coating. Frozen wings can release excess moisture, which can affect the crispiness.</p>

        <h3>2. Are all hot sauces gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Not all hot sauces are gluten-free. Always check the label to ensure the sauce doesn’t contain gluten-containing ingredients like malt vinegar or thickeners.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make these wings in an air fryer?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Air fryers are a great option for gluten-free wings, as they cook quickly and produce a crispy texture with less oil.</p>

        <h3>4. What can I serve with gluten-free chicken wings?</h3>
        <p>Pair your wings with gluten-free sides like celery sticks, carrot sticks, or a fresh salad. For dipping, try gluten-free ranch or blue cheese dressing.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free chicken wings are a fantastic option for anyone looking to enjoy this classic dish without compromising on flavor or texture. With the right ingredients and techniques, you can create wings that are crispy, flavorful, and completely gluten-free. Whether you’re hosting a game-day party or simply craving a tasty snack, this recipe is sure to impress. Give it a try and discover how easy it is to make gluten-free chicken wings at home!</p>
