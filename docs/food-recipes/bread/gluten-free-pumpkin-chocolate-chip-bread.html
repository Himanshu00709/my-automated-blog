<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's walk through the process of making this delicious gluten-free pumpkin chocolate chip bread:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. You can also line it with parchment paper for easier removal.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs, melted coconut oil (or butter), and brown sugar until well combined. The mixture should be smooth and slightly glossy.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and spices. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense loaf.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Fold in the Chocolate Chips</h3>
<p>Gently fold in the chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter. This step is crucial for achieving that perfect chocolatey bite in every slice.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The bread should be golden brown and fragrant.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve with a cup of coffee or tea for the ultimate fall experience.</p>

    <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
    <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 3 months.</p>
