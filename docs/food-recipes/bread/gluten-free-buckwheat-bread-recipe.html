    <h1>Gluten-Free Buckwheat Bread Recipe</h1>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference. One of the challenges of gluten-free baking is finding a bread that is both nutritious and delicious. Enter buckwheat bread—a hearty, gluten-free option that is packed with nutrients and flavor. In this article, we’ll explore a detailed recipe for gluten-free buckwheat bread, along with tips, FAQs, and nutritional insights.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Buckwheat?</h2>
    <p>Buckwheat, despite its name, is not related to wheat and is naturally gluten-free. It is a pseudocereal, meaning it is used similarly to grains but is not a true cereal. Buckwheat is rich in fiber, protein, and essential minerals like magnesium and manganese. It also contains antioxidants, making it a powerhouse ingredient for gluten-free baking. Its nutty flavor and dense texture make it an excellent base for bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Buckwheat Bread</h2>
    <p>Here’s what you’ll need to make a loaf of gluten-free buckwheat bread:</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the buckwheat flour, tapioca flour, psyllium husk powder, baking powder, and salt. Whisk thoroughly to ensure even distribution of ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the apple cider vinegar, olive oil (or melted coconut oil), and warm water. Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, stirring continuously to form a dough. The dough should be thick but pliable.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Let the Dough Rest</h3>
    <p>Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for 10-15 minutes. This allows the psyllium husk to absorb moisture and create a gel-like consistency, which helps bind the bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Shape the Dough</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a loaf pan with oil or line it with parchment paper. Transfer the dough to the pan and shape it into a loaf. Smooth the top with a spatula or your hands.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Bread</h3>
    <p>Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
