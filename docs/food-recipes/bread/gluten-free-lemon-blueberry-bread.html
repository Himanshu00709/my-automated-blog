    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Lemon Blueberry Bread</h2>
    <p>Now that we've covered the key ingredients, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making this delicious bread:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a loaf pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 ½ cups of almond flour, ½ cup of coconut flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Whisk these ingredients together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together 3 large eggs, ¼ cup of honey or maple syrup, ¼ cup of melted coconut oil, the zest of 1 lemon, and 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. Mix until smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fold in Blueberries</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in 1 cup of fresh blueberries into the batter. If you're using frozen blueberries, make sure to toss them in a bit of flour to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve with a drizzle of honey or a dollop of Greek yogurt for an extra treat.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Lemon Blueberry Bread</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh ones?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries. However, make sure to toss them in a bit of flour before folding them into the batter to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the bread.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute almond flour with another gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour provides a unique texture and moisture to the bread. If you need to substitute it, you can try using oat flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze the bread for up to 3 months. Simply wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer-safe bag.</p>

        <h3>Is this bread suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe contains eggs, so it is not vegan. However, you can try substituting the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons of water per egg) for a vegan version.</p>
