    <h1>Gluten-Free Blueberry Banana Bread: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>Banana bread is a classic comfort food, loved by many for its moist texture and sweet flavor. But what if you could enjoy this treat while also adhering to a gluten-free diet? Enter gluten-free blueberry banana bread—a delightful twist on the traditional recipe that combines the natural sweetness of ripe bananas with the tangy burst of fresh blueberries. This recipe is not only gluten-free but also packed with nutrients, making it a guilt-free indulgence for anyone, whether you have celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply want to explore healthier baking options.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Banana Bread?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has gained popularity in recent years, and for good reason. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, avoiding gluten is essential to prevent adverse health effects. However, even for those without gluten-related issues, gluten-free baking can offer a range of benefits. Gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, coconut flour, or oat flour, are often richer in fiber, protein, and healthy fats compared to traditional wheat flour. Additionally, gluten-free recipes can be easier to digest and may help reduce inflammation in some individuals.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free blueberry banana bread:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a loaf pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash the bananas:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. You can leave a few small chunks for texture if desired.</li>

        <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
