    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make this delicious gluten-free blueberry bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with a little oil or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and then add the unsweetened applesauce, honey (or maple syrup), vanilla extract, and milk. Mix until the wet ingredients are fully incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fold in Blueberries</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the blueberries into the batter. If you're using frozen blueberries, there's no need to thaw them beforehand. Just make sure they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve as desired.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Blueberry Bread</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like oat flour, coconut flour, or rice flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and use a non-dairy milk like almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other fruits?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add other fruits like raspberries, strawberries, or even diced apples. Just make sure to adjust the quantity accordingly.</p>
