    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a loaf pan with parchment paper or lightly grease it to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, flaxseed meal, psyllium husk, chia seeds, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, apple cider vinegar, and water. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a thick dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add a little more water, one tablespoon at a time, until the desired consistency is reached.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Shape the Dough</h3>
    <p>Transfer the dough to the prepared loaf pan. Use a spatula or your hands to shape the dough into an even loaf. Smooth the top with a wet spatula or your fingers.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Bread</h3>
    <p>Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
