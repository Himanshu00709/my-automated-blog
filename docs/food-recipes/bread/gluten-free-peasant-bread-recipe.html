<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Activate the Yeast</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, honey (or sugar), and yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy. This indicates that the yeast is active and ready to use.</p>

<h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum (if needed), and salt. Ensure the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the dough.</p>

<h3>3. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Add the activated yeast mixture, olive oil, and apple cider vinegar to the dry ingredients. Mix thoroughly until a sticky dough forms. Gluten-free dough will be softer and stickier than traditional bread dough, so don’t be alarmed.</p>

<h3>4. Let the Dough Rise</h3>
<p>Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. The dough should double in size. If your kitchen is cool, you can place the bowl in a slightly warmed oven (turned off) to help the dough rise.</p>

<h3>5. Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a 9-inch round baking dish or a loaf pan with olive oil or non-stick spray.</p>

<h3>6. Shape the Dough</h3>
<p>Once the dough has risen, transfer it to the prepared baking dish. Use wet hands to shape the dough into a round or oval loaf. Smooth the top with a spatula or your hands.</p>

<h3>7. Bake the Bread</h3>
<p>Bake the bread in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when tapped. If the top browns too quickly, you can cover it loosely with aluminum foil.</p>

<h3>8. Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing. This step is crucial to ensure the bread sets properly.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend for the best results. Some blends already include xanthan gum, so check the label before adding it separately.</li>
    <li>If the dough is too sticky, wet your hands with water or oil when handling it.</li>
    <li>For added flavor, consider mixing in herbs, seeds, or grated cheese into the dough before baking.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Peasant Bread</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like almond flour or oat flour, but the texture and rise may vary. A gluten-free all-purpose flour blend is recommended for the best results.</p>

    <h3>2. How do I store gluten-free peasant bread?</h3>
    <p>Store the bread in an airtight container or wrapped in plastic wrap at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, slice and freeze the bread in a freezer-safe bag for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>3. Why is my bread dense?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free bread can sometimes be denser than traditional bread. Ensure your yeast is fresh and active, and let the dough rise fully before baking. Overmixing the dough can also lead to a denser texture.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I make this bread vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Simply replace the honey with maple syrup or another vegan sweetener, and ensure your gluten-free flour blend is vegan-friendly.</p>
</div>

<p>Gluten-free peasant bread is a wonderful addition to any kitchen, offering a simple and delicious way to enjoy homemade bread without gluten.
