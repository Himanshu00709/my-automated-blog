    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make this delicious gluten-free applesauce bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with a little oil or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and ground cinnamon. Make sure all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the unsweetened applesauce, eggs, granulated sugar, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense bread. If you're adding nuts or raisins, fold them in at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Bread</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The baking time may vary depending on your oven, so keep an eye on it after the 50-minute mark.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the bread is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing. Serve warm or at room temperature, and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>Here are a few tips to ensure your gluten-free applesauce bread turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good-quality gluten-free flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense and tough bread. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Ovens can vary, so start checking the bread at the 50-minute mark. If the top is browning too quickly, you can cover it loosely with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze it for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use homemade applesauce?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Homemade applesauce works just as well as store-bought. Just make sure it's unsweetened and smooth for the best results.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute the sugar with a healthier alternative?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use alternatives like coconut sugar, maple syrup, or honey. Keep in mind that liquid sweeteners may slightly alter the texture of the bread.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this recipe is naturally dairy-free. Just make sure to check the labels on your gluten-free flour and other ingredients to ensure they don't contain any hidden dairy.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other mix-ins?</h3>
        <p>Definitely! Feel free to add chocolate chips, dried fruit, or even shredded carrots for a twist on the classic recipe.</p>
