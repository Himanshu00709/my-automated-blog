    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free brown bread:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) and line a loaf tin with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, ground almonds, psyllium husk, baking soda, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>

        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the bread to cool in the tin for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
