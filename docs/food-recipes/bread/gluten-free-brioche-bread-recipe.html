    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the process of making gluten-free brioche bread. Follow these steps carefully to ensure the best results.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Activate the Yeast</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine the warm milk (around 110°F) with the granulated sugar and active dry yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy. This indicates that the yeast is active and ready to use.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, psyllium husk powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs lightly. Add the activated yeast mixture and the beaten eggs to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough begins to form. Gradually add the softened butter, mixing until the dough is smooth and elastic. This may take about 5-7 minutes using a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: First Rise</h3>
    <p>Once the dough is well-mixed, cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size. Gluten-free dough may not rise as much as traditional dough, but it should still increase in volume.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Shape the Dough</h3>
    <p>After the first rise, gently punch down the dough to release any air bubbles. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) and shape it into a loaf. You can also divide the dough into smaller portions to make brioche rolls or buns. Place the shaped dough into a greased loaf pan or on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Second Rise</h3>
    <p>Cover the shaped dough with a kitchen towel and let it rise again for about 30-45 minutes. During this time, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Brioche</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has completed its second rise, brush the top with an egg wash (1 beaten egg mixed with 1 tablespoon of water) for a shiny, golden crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. If the top begins to brown too quickly, you can cover it loosely with aluminum foil.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Remove the brioche from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve your gluten-free brioche bread with your favorite spreads or enjoy it as is!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free brioche bread can be a bit tricky, but these tips will help you achieve the best results:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t skip the psyllium husk powder:</strong> This ingredient is crucial for adding structure and moisture to the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Be patient with the rising process:</strong> Gluten-free dough may take longer to rise, so give it the time it needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Add a touch of vanilla extract or citrus zest to the dough for an extra layer of flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. A blend of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch often works well.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a non-dairy milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free brioche bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the bread for up to 2 months. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Why is my gluten-free brioche dense?</h3>
        <p>If your brioche turns out dense, it could be due to overmixing the dough, not allowing enough time for the dough to rise, or using a flour blend that doesn’t contain enough binding agents like xanthan gum.</p>
