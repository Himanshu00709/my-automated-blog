    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Persimmons</h3>
    <p>Start by selecting ripe persimmons. The flesh should be soft and easy to scoop out. Remove the skin and seeds, then puree the flesh in a blender or food processor until smooth. You should end up with about 1 cup of persimmon puree.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure they are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, melted coconut oil, vanilla extract, and honey or maple syrup. Once these ingredients are well combined, add the persimmon puree and mix until smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense loaf.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Bread</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a loaf pan and pour the batter into it. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
