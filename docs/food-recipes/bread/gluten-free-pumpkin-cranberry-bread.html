    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get baking! Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free pumpkin cranberry bread:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with a little coconut oil or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs, melted coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract until smooth and well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense bread. Gently fold in the cranberries.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve as is, or with a dollop of your favorite spread.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh cranberries instead of dried?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh cranberries if you prefer. Just make sure to chop them into smaller pieces before adding them to the batter. Fresh cranberries will add a slightly more tart flavor to the bread.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute the coconut oil with another oil?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can use any neutral-flavored oil, such as avocado oil or even melted butter, if you're not strictly dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this recipe vegan by substituting the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and using a plant-based sweetener like maple syrup.</p>
    </div>
