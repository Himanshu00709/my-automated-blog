    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Ensure there are no lumps.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then add the honey (or maple syrup), melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Incorporate Zucchini</h3>
    <p>Fold the grated zucchini into the wet mixture. The zucchini will add moisture and a subtle vegetable flavor that complements the sweetness of the blueberries.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the bread dense.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Add Blueberries</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the fresh blueberries. If you’re using frozen blueberries, toss them in a bit of gluten-free flour to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve with a drizzle of honey or a dollop of Greek yogurt for added indulgence.</p>
