    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free cranberry orange bread:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Ensure there are no lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> Stir in the orange zest and freshly squeezed orange juice into the butter mixture. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Cranberries:</strong> Gently fold in the fresh cranberries, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cranberry Orange Bread</h2>

        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh cranberries and freshly squeezed orange juice will give your bread the best flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense bread. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking your bread at the 50-minute mark. If the top is browning too quickly, cover it with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or refrigerate for up to a week. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</li>
