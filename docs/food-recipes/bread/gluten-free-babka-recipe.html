    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by activating the yeast. In a small bowl, combine the warm milk (around 110°F) with a teaspoon of sugar and the yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum (if needed), remaining sugar, and salt. Add the melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract, followed by the activated yeast mixture. Mix until a soft dough forms. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.</p>

    <h3>2. Roll and Fill the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, transfer it to a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour). Roll it out into a rectangle, about ¼ inch thick. Spread your chosen filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. For a chocolate babka, sprinkle chocolate chips or a chocolate spread. For a cinnamon babka, mix cinnamon and sugar and sprinkle it over the dough.</p>

    <h3>3. Shape the Babka</h3>
    <p>Starting from the long side, tightly roll the dough into a log. Using a sharp knife, cut the log in half lengthwise, exposing the layers of filling. Twist the two halves together, then coil the twisted dough into a loaf pan lined with parchment paper. Cover and let it rise for another 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the babka for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow it to cool slightly before slicing and serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend that includes xanthan gum for the best texture.</li>
        <li>Don't skip the rising time—it's crucial for achieving a light and airy babka.</li>
        <li>Experiment with different fillings, such as Nutella, fruit preserves, or even a savory option like cheese and herbs.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and use a non-dairy milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How do I store gluten-free babka?</h3>
        <p>Store your babka in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly and freeze for up to 2 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>While gluten-free flour blends work best, you can experiment with almond flour or oat flour. Keep in mind that the texture may vary.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
