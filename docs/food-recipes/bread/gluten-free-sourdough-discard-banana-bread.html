<h1>Gluten-Free Sourdough Discard Banana Bread: A Delicious and Nutritious Treat</h1>

<p>Banana bread is a classic comfort food that has been enjoyed by generations. But what if you could make it even better by incorporating the tangy flavor of sourdough discard and making it gluten-free? This recipe for Gluten-Free Sourdough Discard Banana Bread is not only delicious but also a great way to use up your sourdough discard, making it a sustainable and nutritious option for your breakfast or snack time.</p>

<h2>Why Gluten-Free Sourdough Discard Banana Bread?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular, especially among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, gluten-free baked goods can sometimes be dense and lack the texture that gluten provides. That's where sourdough discard comes in. The natural fermentation process of sourdough helps to break down the starches in gluten-free flours, resulting in a lighter, more digestible loaf. Plus, the tangy flavor of sourdough discard adds a unique depth to the banana bread that you won't find in traditional recipes.</p>

<h2>Ingredients You'll Need</h2>

<p>Before you start baking, make sure you have the following ingredients on hand:</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

<h3>2. Mash the Bananas</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until they are smooth. The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more flavorful your bread will be.</p>

<h3>3. Mix Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>Add the eggs, melted coconut oil (or butter), maple syrup (or honey), and vanilla extract to the mashed bananas. Mix well until all the ingredients are fully combined.</p>

<h3>4. Add Sourdough Discard</h3>
<p>Stir in the sourdough discard. The discard should be at room temperature to ensure even mixing. The sourdough discard will add a tangy flavor and help to activate the baking soda, giving your bread a nice rise.</p>

<h3>5. Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense loaf.</p>

<h3>6. Add Optional Ingredients</h3>
<p>If you're using nuts or chocolate chips, fold them into the batter at this stage. This is also a good time to add any other mix-ins you might like, such as dried fruit or seeds.</p>

<h3>7. Bake the Bread</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. If the top of the bread starts to brown too quickly, you can cover it loosely with aluminum foil.</p>

<h3>8. Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Once the bread is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing. This will help the bread set and make it easier to slice.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the bread to be gluten-free. However, the texture and flavor may be slightly different.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of sourdough discard?</h3>
    <p>If you don't have sourdough discard, you can substitute it with an equal amount of plain yogurt or buttermilk. This will add a similar tangy flavor and help with the rise.</p>

    <h3>How should I store the banana bread?</h3>
    <p>Store the banana bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can wrap it tightly and freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make this recipe vegan by substituting the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and using a plant-based oil instead of coconut oil or butter.</p>
</div>
