<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Bread Machine</h3>

<p>Start by ensuring your bread machine is clean and ready to use. Insert the bread pan into the machine and attach the kneading paddle. Most bread machines have a specific order in which ingredients should be added, so consult your machine's manual if you're unsure. Generally, liquids go in first, followed by dry ingredients, with yeast added last.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Add the Wet Ingredients</h3>

<p>Pour the warm water into the bread pan. Add the eggs, vegetable oil, and apple cider vinegar. The warm water helps activate the yeast, while the eggs and oil contribute to the bread's moisture and texture. The vinegar helps to tenderize the gluten-free flour, making the bread less dense.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add the Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, xanthan gum, sugar, salt, and ground cinnamon. Xanthan gum is essential in gluten-free baking as it helps to bind the ingredients together, mimicking the elasticity that gluten provides. Once mixed, add the dry ingredients to the bread pan on top of the wet ingredients.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add the Yeast and Raisins</h3>

<p>Make a small well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the yeast. This prevents the yeast from coming into contact with the wet ingredients too soon, which could affect its performance. Finally, add the raisins. Some bread machines have a dispenser for add-ins like raisins, so you can add them later in the cycle if your machine has this feature.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Select the Gluten-Free Setting</h3>

<p>Most modern bread machines have a gluten-free setting. Select this option on your machine. If your machine doesn't have a gluten-free setting, choose the basic or sweet bread setting. Set the crust color to your preference—medium is usually a good choice for this type of bread.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Start the Machine</h3>

<p>Close the lid of the bread machine and press start. The machine will take care of the mixing, kneading, rising, and baking. The entire process typically takes around 3 to 4 hours, depending on your machine.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>

<p>Once the bread is done, carefully remove the bread pan from the machine using oven mitts. Let the bread cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slicing the bread while it's still warm can cause it to crumble, so patience is key. Once cooled, slice and enjoy!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. A blend of gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch, often works well. Make sure to include xanthan gum if your flour blend doesn't already contain it.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe without a bread machine?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can make this recipe by hand or using a stand mixer. Follow the same steps for mixing the ingredients, then knead the dough by hand or with a dough hook. Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, then bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 30-40 minutes.</p>

    <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
    <p>Store the bread in an airtight container or plastic bag at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the bread. Slice it before freezing, so you can easily take out individual slices as needed.</p>

    <h3>Can I add nuts or other dried fruits?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can customize this recipe by adding nuts like walnuts or pecans, or other dried fruits like cranberries or apricots. Just make sure to keep the total volume of add-ins around 1 cup to avoid overloading the dough.</p>
