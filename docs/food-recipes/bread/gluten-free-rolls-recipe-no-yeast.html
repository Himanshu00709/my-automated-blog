    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it to prevent the rolls from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and xanthan gum (if using). Whisk these ingredients together until well combined. This ensures that the leavening agents are evenly distributed, which is crucial for achieving the perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, eggs, milk, and apple cider vinegar. The vinegar helps to activate the baking soda, giving the rolls a light and airy texture. Make sure the wet ingredients are thoroughly mixed before proceeding to the next step.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir until a soft dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense rolls. The dough should be slightly sticky but manageable.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Shape the Rolls</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or your hands, divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball and place it on the prepared baking sheet. Space the rolls about 2 inches apart to allow for even baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Bake the rolls in the preheated oven for 15-18 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. To check for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of a roll; it should come out clean. Once baked, remove the rolls from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t skip the xanthan gum:</strong> While optional, xanthan gum helps to bind the ingredients together, giving the rolls a more bread-like texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Add herbs, garlic powder, or grated cheese to the dough for a savory twist, or mix in a bit of honey and cinnamon for a sweeter version.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these rolls dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make these rolls dairy-free by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative (like coconut oil) and using a dairy-free milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How do I store these rolls?</h3>
        <p>Store the rolls in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 1 month. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of vinegar?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute apple cider vinegar with white vinegar or lemon juice. The acidity is necessary to activate the baking soda, so don’t skip this ingredient.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>These gluten-free, yeast-free rolls are a game-changer for anyone looking to enjoy bread without the hassle of traditional baking. They’re quick to make, require minimal ingredients, and deliver a soft, fluffy texture that’s hard to resist. Whether you’re serving them with dinner, using them for sandwiches, or enjoying them on their own, these rolls are sure to become a staple in your kitchen.
