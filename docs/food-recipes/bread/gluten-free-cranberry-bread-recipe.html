    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's walk through the steps to make this delicious gluten-free cranberry bread:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with a little oil or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and then add the unsweetened applesauce, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract. Mix until the wet ingredients are fully incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add Cranberries and Orange Zest</h3>
    <p>Fold in the cranberries and orange zest into the batter. The cranberries add a delightful tartness, while the orange zest provides a fresh, citrusy aroma.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve as desired.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cranberry Bread</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free cranberry bread turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Cranberries:</strong> Fresh cranberries provide the best flavor and texture, but frozen cranberries can also be used if fresh ones are unavailable.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense bread. Mix until just combined for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking the bread at the 50-minute mark. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use dried cranberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use dried cranberries, but keep in mind that they are sweeter and less tart than fresh cranberries. If using dried cranberries, consider reducing the amount of sweetener in the recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this bread vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this bread vegan by substituting the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and using a plant-based sweetener like maple syrup.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of almond flour?</h3>
        <p>If you have a nut allergy, you can substitute almond flour with an equal amount of oat flour or another gluten-free flour of your choice.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this bread?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this bread freezes well. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil before placing it in the freezer. It can be stored for up to 3 months.</p>
