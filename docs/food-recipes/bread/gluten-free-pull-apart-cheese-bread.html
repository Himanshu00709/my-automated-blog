    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a loaf pan or baking dish with butter or non-stick spray to prevent the bread from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum (if needed), baking powder, and salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure they are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and melted butter. Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, stirring until a smooth dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the bread dense.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Incorporate Cheese</h3>
    <p>Fold in 1 cup of shredded cheese into the dough, reserving the remaining 1/2 cup for topping. Add garlic powder for extra flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Assemble the Bread</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or your hands, scoop small portions of the dough and roll them into balls. Place these balls into the prepared loaf pan, layering them to create a pull-apart effect. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Bake the bread in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly. If desired, garnish with fresh parsley before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum or add it separately to achieve the right texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't skip the cheese:</strong> Cheese is the star of this dish, so choose a variety that melts well, like cheddar or mozzarella.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Add herbs, spices, or even a touch of chili flakes to customize the bread to your taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Simply substitute the milk with a dairy-free alternative like almond or oat milk, and use vegan cheese and butter.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover bread in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free pull-apart cheese bread?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. Wrap the bread tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and reheat in the oven.</p>
