    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make your gluten-free Easter bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Activate the Yeast</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine the warm milk and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the mixture and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. This step is crucial as it ensures that your bread will rise properly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, salt, and any optional dried fruit. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Add the yeast mixture to the wet ingredients and mix well. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a dough forms. The dough will be sticky, but that's normal for gluten-free bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Let the Dough Rise</h3>
    <p>Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size. Gluten-free dough may not rise as much as traditional dough, but it will still expand.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Shape the Bread</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, gently punch it down and transfer it to a lightly floured surface. Shape the dough into a round loaf or braid it for a more traditional Easter bread look. Place the shaped dough on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Second Rise</h3>
    <p>Cover the shaped dough with a kitchen towel and let it rise for another 30-45 minutes. Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C) during this time.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Bread</h3>
    <p>Before baking, brush the top of the bread with the egg wash. This will give your bread a beautiful golden crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the bread to cool on a wire rack before slicing. Serve it warm or at room temperature, and enjoy the delicious flavors of your gluten-free Easter bread!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Easter Bread</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but keep in mind that the texture and rise of the bread may vary. A blend that includes rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch usually works well.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this bread dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the milk with a non-dairy alternative like almond or oat milk, and use a dairy-free butter substitute.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly and freeze it for up to a month.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other ingredients like nuts or chocolate chips?</h3>
        <p>Yes, feel free to customize your bread by adding nuts, chocolate chips, or even citrus zest for extra flavor.</p>
