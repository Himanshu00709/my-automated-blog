    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free strawberry bread:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a loaf pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the almond flour, oat flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir until well mixed.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, honey (or maple syrup), melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Add strawberries:</strong> Gently fold in the chopped strawberries, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Strawberry Bread</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free strawberry bread is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Almond flour is rich in healthy fats, protein, and vitamin E, while oat flour provides fiber and helps regulate blood sugar levels. Strawberries are a great source of vitamin C, manganese, and antioxidants, which support immune health and reduce inflammation. By using natural sweeteners like honey or maple syrup, you avoid the blood sugar spikes associated with refined sugars.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Strawberry Bread</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use frozen strawberries instead of fresh ones?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries, but make sure to thaw and drain them thoroughly before adding them to the batter. Excess moisture can affect the texture of the bread.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I substitute almond flour with another gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can use other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Keep in mind that different flours have different absorption rates, so you may need to adjust the quantity of wet ingredients.</p>

        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>4. Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe includes eggs, but you can make it vegan by using flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and substituting honey with maple syrup.</p>
