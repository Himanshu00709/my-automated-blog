    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free blueberry lemon bread:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan and line it with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the unsalted butter (or coconut oil) and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in the Greek yogurt, followed by the fresh blueberries. Be gentle to avoid crushing the berries.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free blueberry lemon bread turns out perfectly:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense and tough bread. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use fresh blueberries:</strong> Fresh blueberries provide the best flavor and texture, but you can also use frozen blueberries if fresh ones are not available. Just be sure to toss them in a bit of flour before adding them to the batter to prevent them from sinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the bread cool completely:</strong> This allows the flavors to meld and makes it easier to slice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. A blend of gluten-free flours usually works best for baking.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this bread dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with coconut oil and use a dairy-free yogurt alternative to make this bread dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other fruits?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other fruits like raspberries, blackberries, or even diced apples. Just be mindful of the moisture content of the fruit you choose.</p>
