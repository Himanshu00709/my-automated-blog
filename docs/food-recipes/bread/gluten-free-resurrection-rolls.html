    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum (if needed), baking powder, salt, and sugar. Cut in the cold butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Milk:</strong> Gradually add the milk, stirring until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Rolls:</strong> Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Flatten each portion into a circle and place a marshmallow in the center. Wrap the dough around the marshmallow, sealing it completely.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat with Cinnamon Sugar:</strong> Roll each dough ball in the cinnamon sugar mixture, ensuring it is evenly coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the rolls on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the rolls are golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the rolls to cool slightly before serving. As they cool, the marshmallow will melt, leaving an empty "tomb."</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Resurrection Rolls</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free baked goods can be tricky, but with a few tips, you can achieve perfect resurrection rolls every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking and includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep Ingredients Cold:</strong> Cold butter and milk help create a flaky, tender dough. If the dough becomes too warm, chill it in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes before shaping the rolls.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense, tough rolls. Mix the dough just until it comes together, and handle it as little as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Gluten-Free Certification:</strong> Ensure that all ingredients, including marshmallows, are certified gluten-free to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Resurrection Rolls</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these rolls dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make these rolls dairy-free by using a dairy-free butter substitute and a non-dairy milk alternative, such as almond milk or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>Can I prepare the dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. When you’re ready to bake, let the dough come to room temperature before shaping the rolls.</p>

        <h3>What if I don’t have xanthan gum?</h3>
        <p>If your gluten-free flour blend doesn’t include xanthan gum, you can substitute it with psyllium husk or guar gum. These ingredients help bind the dough and improve its texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the baked rolls?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked rolls for up to 2 months. To reheat, simply place them in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 10-15 minutes, or until warmed through.</p>
