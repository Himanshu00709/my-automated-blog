    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step process of making gluten-free multigrain bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Activate the Yeast</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine the warm water (around 110°F) with the honey or maple syrup. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. This indicates that the yeast is active and ready to use.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, quinoa flour, millet flour, buckwheat flour, flaxseed meal, psyllium husk, and salt. Mix well to ensure all the ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add the activated yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Stir until a dough forms. The dough will be sticky, but that’s normal for gluten-free bread. If the dough is too dry, add a little more warm water, one tablespoon at a time.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Let the Dough Rise</h3>
    <p>Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. The dough should double in size. This step is crucial for achieving a light and airy texture in your bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Shape the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, transfer it to a greased loaf pan. Use a spatula or your hands to shape the dough into a loaf. Smooth the top with a wet spatula or your fingers to create an even surface.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Bread</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the loaf pan in the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Multigrain Bread</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free multigrain bread is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Here’s a breakdown of the key nutrients you’ll find in this bread:</p>
