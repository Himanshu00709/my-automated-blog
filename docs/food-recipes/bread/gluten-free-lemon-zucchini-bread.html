    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free lemon zucchini bread:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract, and mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate zucchini:</strong> Fold in the grated zucchini until evenly distributed throughout the wet mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve!</li>
    </ol>
