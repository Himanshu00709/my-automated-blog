    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free cinnamon pull-apart bread requires a bit of patience, but the results are well worth the effort. Follow these steps to create your own delicious loaf:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by activating the yeast. Warm the milk to about 110°F (43°C) and mix it with a teaspoon of sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the milk and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and remaining sugar. Add the yeast mixture, melted butter, and eggs, and mix until a soft dough forms. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</p>

    <h3>2. Let the Dough Rise</h3>
    <p>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size. Gluten-free dough may not rise as much as traditional dough, but it should still increase in volume.</p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Cinnamon Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is rising, prepare the cinnamon filling by mixing together cinnamon, sugar, and a bit of melted butter. This mixture will be spread between the layers of dough to create the pull-apart effect.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Bread</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, roll it out into a rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Spread the cinnamon filling evenly over the dough, then cut it into small squares or rectangles. Stack the squares in a greased loaf pan, layering them slightly unevenly to create a rustic, pull-apart look.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Cover the loaf pan with a towel and let the dough rise for another 30 minutes. Bake the bread for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the bread cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>Here are a few tips to ensure your gluten-free cinnamon pull-apart bread turns out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking bread.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Xanthan Gum:</strong> This ingredient is crucial for giving the dough elasticity and preventing it from crumbling.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Patient with the Rising Process:</strong> Gluten-free dough may take longer to rise, so give it the time it needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add nuts, raisins, or even a drizzle of icing to customize your bread.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this bread dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make this bread dairy-free by using a non-dairy milk alternative (such as almond or oat milk) and vegan butter.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly and freeze it for up to 2 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>This recipe is specifically designed for gluten-free flour blends. Using a different type of flour may alter the texture and rise of the bread.</p>

        <h3>Why is my bread dense?</h3>
        <p>Dense bread can result from over-kneading the dough or not allowing it to rise sufficiently. Make sure to follow the rising times closely and handle the dough gently.</p>
