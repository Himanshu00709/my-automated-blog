    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get baking! Follow these steps to create a moist, flavorful gluten-free sourdough banana bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper. Mash the ripe bananas in a large mixing bowl until smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In the same bowl, add the melted coconut oil (or butter), maple syrup (or honey), eggs, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined. Then, stir in the gluten-free sourdough starter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense loaf.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Bread</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Sourdough Banana Bread</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a regular sourdough starter for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>No, a regular sourdough starter contains gluten, which defeats the purpose of making gluten-free banana bread. Be sure to use a gluten-free sourdough starter, which can be made from gluten-free flours like rice, buckwheat, or sorghum.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I store gluten-free sourdough banana bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I add nuts or chocolate chips to the recipe?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Feel free to customize your banana bread by adding chopped nuts, chocolate chips, or even dried fruit. Just fold them into the batter before baking.</p>

        <h3>4. Is gluten-free sourdough banana bread healthier than regular banana bread?</h3>
        <p>While both types of banana bread can be part of a balanced diet, gluten-free sourdough banana bread may be easier to digest for those with gluten sensitivities. The fermentation process also enhances nutrient absorption, making it a healthier option for some individuals.</p>
