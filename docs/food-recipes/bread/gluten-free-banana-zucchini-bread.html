    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free banana zucchini bread:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and greasing a loaf pan with a little oil or lining it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. Add the eggs, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract, and whisk until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined.</li>

        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and enjoy!</li>
