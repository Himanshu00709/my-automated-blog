<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare Your Bread Machine</h3>

<p>Start by ensuring your bread machine is clean and ready to use. Insert the kneading paddle into the bread pan. This recipe is designed for a 2-pound loaf, so make sure your machine is set to the appropriate size.</p>

<h3>2. Add Wet Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the warm water, vegetable oil, and eggs. Pour this mixture into the bread pan first. This helps to activate the yeast and ensures even mixing.</p>

<h3>3. Add Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum (if needed), sugar, salt, and ground cinnamon. Mix these dry ingredients well before adding them to the bread pan on top of the wet ingredients.</p>

<h3>4. Add Yeast and Raisins</h3>

<p>Make a small well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the yeast. This prevents the yeast from coming into contact with the wet ingredients too early. Finally, sprinkle the raisins evenly over the top.</p>

<h3>5. Select the Gluten-Free Setting</h3>

<p>Place the bread pan into the machine and select the gluten-free setting. If your machine doesn't have a specific gluten-free setting, use the basic or sweet bread setting. Set the crust color to your preference (medium is recommended).</p>

<h3>6. Start the Machine</h3>

<p>Close the lid and start the machine. The dough will mix, rise, and bake automatically. The entire process typically takes about 3 to 4 hours, depending on your machine.</p>

<h3>7. Cool and Serve</h3>

<p>Once the bread is done, carefully remove the bread pan from the machine. Let the bread cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing. This helps to prevent the bread from becoming too dense.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>

<p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free cinnamon raisin bread turns out perfectly every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that is specifically designed for bread baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Check the Yeast:</strong> Make sure your yeast is fresh and active. Old or expired yeast can result in a dense loaf.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't Overload the Raisins:</strong> While raisins add sweetness and texture, too many can make the bread heavy. Stick to the recommended amount.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the Bread Cool Completely:</strong> Gluten-free bread can be delicate when warm. Allowing it to cool completely will make it easier to slice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. Almond flour or coconut flour can be used, but they may require additional adjustments to the recipe.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this bread without a bread machine?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can make this bread by hand or with a stand mixer. Follow the same steps, but knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes, let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, then bake in a preheated oven at 350°F for 30-40 minutes.</p>

    <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
    <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I add nuts or other dried fruits?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can customize this recipe by adding nuts like walnuts or pecans, or other dried fruits like cranberries or apricots. Just be mindful of the total volume to avoid overloading the dough.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free cinnamon raisin bread is a delightful treat that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the help of a bread machine, this recipe is straightforward and yields a delicious, aromatic loaf that's perfect for breakfast, snacks, or even dessert. By following the tips and instructions provided, you'll be able to create a gluten-free bread that's soft, flavorful, and satisfying. Happy baking!</p>
