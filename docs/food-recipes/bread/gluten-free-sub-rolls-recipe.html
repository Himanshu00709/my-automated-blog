<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Activate the Yeast</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, honey (or sugar), and active dry yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy. This indicates that the yeast is activated and ready to use.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Dough</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and apple cider vinegar. Gradually add the yeast mixture to the wet ingredients, stirring until well combined. Slowly incorporate the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, mixing until a dough forms. The dough should be slightly sticky but manageable.</p>

<h3>3. Shape the Rolls</h3>
<p>Divide the dough into equal portions, depending on the size of the sub rolls you desire. Shape each portion into a roll by gently rolling it between your hands. Place the rolls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving enough space between them to allow for expansion during baking.</p>

<h3>4. Let the Dough Rise</h3>
<p>Cover the shaped rolls with a clean kitchen towel and let them rise in a warm place for about 30-45 minutes. The rolls should double in size during this time. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) while the dough is rising.</p>

<h3>5. Bake the Rolls</h3>
<p>Once the rolls have risen, place them in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. To check for doneness, tap the bottom of a roll; it should sound hollow. Remove the rolls from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack before slicing and serving.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Sub Rolls</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking bread, as it will yield the best results.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Xanthan Gum:</strong> Xanthan gum is essential in gluten-free baking as it helps to bind the ingredients together, giving the rolls a more bread-like texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the Dough Rise Properly:</strong> Allowing the dough to rise is crucial for achieving light and fluffy rolls. Be patient and give the dough enough time to double in size.</li>
    <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Gluten-free bread tends to dry out faster than traditional bread. Store your sub rolls in an airtight container or bag to keep them fresh for longer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary. A blend of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch often works well for bread recipes.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these rolls vegan?</h3>
    <p>To make these rolls vegan, you can substitute the eggs with a flaxseed or chia seed egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed or chia seeds mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg). However, the texture may be slightly different.</p>

    <h3>How long do these rolls stay fresh?</h3>
    <p>These gluten-free sub rolls are best enjoyed within 2-3 days. To extend their freshness, you can store them in the freezer and reheat them as needed.</p>

    <h3>Can I add herbs or seeds to the dough?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Adding herbs like rosemary or thyme, or seeds like sesame or poppy, can enhance the flavor and texture of your sub rolls. Simply mix them into the dough before shaping.</p>
