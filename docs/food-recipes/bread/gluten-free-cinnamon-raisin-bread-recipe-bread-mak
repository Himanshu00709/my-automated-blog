    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Bread Maker</h3>

    <p>Start by ensuring that your bread maker is clean and ready for use. Insert the kneading paddle into the bread pan. This step is crucial to ensure that the dough is mixed and kneaded properly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, salt, and ground cinnamon. Mix these dry ingredients thoroughly to ensure an even distribution of flavors and textures.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Activate the Yeast</h3>

    <p>In a separate small bowl, dissolve the active dry yeast in warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. This step is essential to activate the yeast, which will help the bread rise.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>

    <p>In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, vegetable oil, and honey (or maple syrup). Once the yeast is activated, add it to this mixture and stir well.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add Wet Ingredients to Dry Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms. The dough will be slightly sticky, which is normal for gluten-free bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Add Raisins</h3>

    <p>Gently fold in the raisins, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the dough. This will give your bread a delightful burst of sweetness in every bite.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Transfer to Bread Maker</h3>

    <p>Transfer the dough to the bread pan of your bread maker. Select the gluten-free setting if your bread maker has one. If not, use the basic bread setting. Set the crust color to your preference (medium is recommended).</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Bake and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Start the bread maker and let it do its magic. Once the baking cycle is complete, carefully remove the bread from the pan and let it cool on a wire rack before slicing. Enjoy your homemade gluten-free cinnamon raisin bread!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, such as almond flour or coconut flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe without a bread maker?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can make this recipe by hand or using a stand mixer. Follow the same steps, but you’ll need to knead the dough manually and bake it in a conventional oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 30-40 minutes.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the bread for up to 3 months. Simply slice it before freezing for easy thawing.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts to the recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add chopped nuts like walnuts or pecans for added texture and flavor. Just fold them in along with the raisins.</p>
    </div>
