    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these steps to create your applesauce gluten-free cake:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, mix the applesauce, sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and milk until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve as is or with a dusting of powdered sugar.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Baking</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking can be tricky, but with these tips, you can achieve a perfect cake every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Good Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can bake differently than traditional cakes. Use a toothpick to check for doneness, and if it comes out clean, your cake is ready.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it Cool:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be more delicate when warm. Allow the cake to cool completely before slicing.</li>
    </ul>
