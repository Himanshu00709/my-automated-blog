    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper to ensure easy removal of the cake after baking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Ensure that these ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in your batter.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving the perfect texture in your cake.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Add the vanilla extract and mix until the batter is smooth and well combined.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix the batter.</p>

    <h3>6. Fold in White Chocolate</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the white chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter. This will create pockets of melted white chocolate in every bite.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>8. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a drizzle of melted white chocolate for an extra touch of indulgence.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use dark or milk chocolate instead of white chocolate?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute white chocolate with dark or milk chocolate if you prefer. However, keep in mind that the flavor profile will change, and the cake may be richer or more intense depending on the type of chocolate used.</p>

        <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>A 1:1 gluten-free flour blend, such as those from brands like Bob’s Red Mill or King Arthur, works well in this recipe. These blends are designed to mimic the texture of all-purpose flour, ensuring your cake turns out light and fluffy.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can use dairy-free butter and a non-dairy milk alternative, such as almond or oat milk, to make this cake dairy-free. Just ensure that the white chocolate you use is also dairy-free, as some brands contain milk solids.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months. Be sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil before freezing.</p>

The creamy, sweet flavor of white chocolate complements the light and airy texture of the cake, creating a treat that is both indulgent and accessible to those with gluten sensitivities. With the right ingredients and a bit of patience, you can create a dessert that is sure to impress your family and friends.
