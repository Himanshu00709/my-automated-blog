    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's move on to the step-by-step instructions for making this delectable white chocolate gluten-free yellow cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper to ensure easy removal of the cake after baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Melt the White Chocolate</h3>
    <p>In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the white chocolate chips in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until smooth. Be careful not to overheat, as white chocolate can burn easily. Set aside to cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the unsalted butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This process helps to incorporate air into the batter, resulting in a lighter cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Add the vanilla extract and mix until combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. This ensures that the leavening agents are evenly distributed throughout the flour.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Alternate Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined; overmixing can lead to a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Fold in Melted White Chocolate</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the melted white chocolate into the batter until evenly distributed. The white chocolate will add a rich, creamy texture to the cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and serve with your favorite toppings or enjoy it as is.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>Here are some additional tips to ensure your white chocolate gluten-free yellow cake turns out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality White Chocolate:</strong> The quality of the white chocolate can significantly impact the flavor of the cake. Opt for a high-quality brand with a high cocoa butter content.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure Ingredients Accurately:</strong> Baking is a science, and accurate measurements are crucial, especially when working with gluten-free flours.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until just combined to maintain a light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking the cake a few minutes before the recommended baking time to avoid overbaking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use dark or milk chocolate instead of white chocolate?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute dark or milk chocolate for white chocolate if you prefer a different flavor profile. However, keep in mind that the sweetness and texture of the cake may vary.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can use dairy-free white chocolate and a dairy-free milk alternative to make this cake suitable for those with dairy allergies or dietary preferences.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. If refrigerated, allow the cake to come to room temperature before serving for the best texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cake for up to 3 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>
