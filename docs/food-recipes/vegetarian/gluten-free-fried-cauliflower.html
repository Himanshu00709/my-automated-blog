    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Cauliflower:</strong> Cut the cauliflower into bite-sized florets. Rinse them thoroughly and pat them dry with a paper towel.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Batter:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the Cauliflower:</strong> Dip each cauliflower floret into the beaten eggs, then coat it with the flour mixture. Make sure each piece is evenly coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong> In a deep frying pan or pot, heat the oil to 350°F (175°C). Make sure there’s enough oil to fully submerge the cauliflower florets.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Cauliflower:</strong> Carefully place the coated cauliflower florets into the hot oil. Fry them in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Cook until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per batch.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Serve:</strong> Remove the fried cauliflower from the oil and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
