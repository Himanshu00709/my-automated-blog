    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Butternut Squash</h3>

    <p>Start by peeling the butternut squash and slicing it into thin, even layers. You can use a sharp knife or a mandoline slicer for this step. The thinner the slices, the easier they’ll be to layer and the quicker they’ll cook. Once sliced, lightly brush the pieces with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast them in the oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 15-20 minutes, or until they’re tender but not mushy.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Filling</h3>

    <p>While the squash is roasting, prepare the ricotta filling. In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, minced garlic, and chopped spinach. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. If you like, you can also add a dash of nutmeg for extra flavor. Mix everything well and set aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Lasagna</h3>

    <p>In a baking dish, start by spreading a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom. Next, add a layer of roasted butternut squash slices, followed by a layer of the ricotta mixture. Sprinkle a handful of shredded mozzarella and a bit of grated Parmesan on top. Repeat these layers until you’ve used up all your ingredients, finishing with a layer of marinara sauce and a generous topping of cheese.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>

    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown. Let the lasagna rest for about 10 minutes before serving to allow the layers to set.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>This gluten-free butternut squash lasagna is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Butternut squash is rich in antioxidants, which help combat inflammation and support overall health. The ricotta and mozzarella cheeses provide a good source of protein and calcium, while the spinach adds iron and additional vitamins. By using gluten-free ingredients, this dish is also suitable for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this lasagna ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can assemble the lasagna up to a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. When you’re ready to bake, simply remove it from the fridge, let it come to room temperature, and then bake as directed.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free butternut squash lasagna?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This lasagna freezes well. After assembling, cover it tightly with plastic wrap and aluminum foil, then freeze for up to 3 months. When ready to eat, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and bake as usual.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of ricotta cheese?</h3>
        <p>If you’re not a fan of ricotta, you can substitute it with cottage cheese or a dairy-free alternative like cashew cheese. The texture and flavor will vary slightly, but it will still be delicious.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can be adapted for vegans by using plant-based cheeses and a vegan ricotta substitute. Be sure to check that your marinara sauce is also vegan-friendly.</p>
