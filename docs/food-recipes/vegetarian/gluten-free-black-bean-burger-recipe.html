    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free black bean burgers:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Black Beans:</strong> Start by rinsing and draining the black beans. Place them in a large mixing bowl and mash them with a fork or potato masher until they are mostly mashed but still have some whole beans for texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Ingredients:</strong> Add the gluten-free oats, chopped red onion, minced garlic, cilantro, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper to the mashed black beans. Mix everything together until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Patties:</strong> Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a patty. Make sure the patties are firm and hold together well.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Patties:</strong> Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and heated through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve your gluten-free black bean burgers on gluten-free buns or lettuce wraps, and add your favorite toppings such as avocado, tomato, lettuce, and vegan mayo.</li>
