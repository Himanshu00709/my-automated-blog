    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Spinach Filling</h3>

    <p>Start by washing the spinach thoroughly to remove any dirt or grit. Once cleaned, blanch the spinach in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, then drain and squeeze out any excess water. Chop the spinach finely and set it aside.</p>

    <p>In a pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil and sauté the finely chopped onion and garlic until they become translucent. Add the chopped spinach to the pan and cook for another 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Gluten-Free Crust</h3>

    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and a pinch of salt. Gradually add water while mixing until the dough comes together. Knead the dough gently until it’s smooth and elastic. Roll out the dough on a floured surface and line a pie dish with it, ensuring the edges are well-covered.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Pie</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs and crumble the feta cheese into the mixture. Combine the egg and cheese mixture with the cooled spinach filling. Pour the filling into the prepared crust and spread it evenly.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Pie</h3>

    <p>Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is set. Remove from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</p>
