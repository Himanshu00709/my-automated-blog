<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). This high temperature is perfect for roasting Brussels sprouts, as it helps to caramelize the outer leaves while keeping the inside tender.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Brussels Sprouts</h3>
<p>Start by washing the Brussels sprouts thoroughly under cold water. Trim the ends and remove any yellow or damaged outer leaves. If the sprouts are large, you can cut them in half to ensure even cooking.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Season the Brussels Sprouts</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, toss the Brussels sprouts with olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper. Make sure each sprout is evenly coated with the seasoning. This step is crucial for ensuring that the flavors are well-distributed.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Roast the Brussels Sprouts</h3>
<p>Spread the seasoned Brussels sprouts in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast them in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and tender. Be sure to stir them halfway through the cooking time to ensure even roasting.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Add the Finishing Touches</h3>
<p>Once the Brussels sprouts are roasted to perfection, remove them from the oven. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese if desired. The balsamic vinegar adds a tangy sweetness that complements the savory flavors of the dish, while the Parmesan cheese adds a rich, nutty finish.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! To make this recipe vegan, simply omit the Parmesan cheese or use a vegan cheese alternative. The rest of the ingredients are already plant-based.</p>

    <h3>3. How do I store leftover Brussels sprouts?</h3>
    <p>Leftover Brussels sprouts can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply place them in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes, or until heated through.</p>
