    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Zucchini</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Wash the zucchinis thoroughly and cut them in half lengthwise. Use a spoon to scoop out the flesh from the center, leaving about a 1/4-inch thick shell. Chop the scooped-out zucchini flesh and set it aside for later use.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant. Add the chopped zucchini flesh, diced tomatoes, and chopped spinach to the skillet. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the cooked quinoa and season with salt and pepper to taste. If you're using Parmesan cheese, mix it in at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Stuff the Zucchini</h3>
    <p>Place the zucchini halves on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spoon the quinoa and vegetable mixture into the hollowed-out zucchini halves, pressing down gently to pack the filling. If desired, sprinkle a little extra Parmesan cheese on top for added flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the stuffed zucchinis in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the zucchini shells are tender and the filling is heated through. For a golden-brown top, you can broil the zucchinis for an additional 2-3 minutes, but keep a close eye on them to prevent burning.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Stuffed Zucchini</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Zucchini:</strong> Look for medium-sized zucchinis that are firm and free of blemishes. Larger zucchinis can be too watery, while smaller ones may not hold enough filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize the Filling:</strong> Feel free to experiment with different fillings. You can add cooked ground turkey, mushrooms, or even a sprinkle of feta cheese for a Mediterranean twist.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> You can prepare the filling and stuff the zucchinis a day in advance. Simply cover them with plastic wrap and refrigerate until you're ready to bake.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve with a Side:</strong> Gluten-free stuffed zucchini pairs well with a fresh green salad or a side of roasted vegetables for a complete meal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use other grains instead of quinoa?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute quinoa with other gluten-free grains like rice, millet, or even gluten-free breadcrumbs for a different texture.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Is this dish suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply omit the Parmesan cheese or use a vegan cheese alternative to make this dish vegan-friendly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover stuffed zucchinis in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
