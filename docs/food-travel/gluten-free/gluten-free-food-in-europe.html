<h1>Gluten-Free Food in Europe: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Traveling through Europe is a dream for many, but for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, it can also be a source of anxiety. The good news is that Europe has become increasingly accommodating to gluten-free diets, with many countries offering a wide range of gluten-free options. In this guide, we’ll explore the gluten-free food scene across Europe, highlighting the best places to eat, shop, and enjoy gluten-free cuisine.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term complications. A gluten-free diet eliminates all foods containing gluten, which means avoiding traditional bread, pasta, and many processed foods. However, with the rise in awareness of gluten-related disorders, Europe has seen a surge in gluten-free products and restaurants catering to this dietary need.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Food Trends in Europe</h2>

<p>Europe has been at the forefront of the gluten-free movement, with many countries adopting strict labeling laws and offering a variety of gluten-free products. Here are some of the key trends:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Strict Labeling Laws:</strong> The European Union has stringent regulations on food labeling, making it easier for consumers to identify gluten-free products. Products labeled as "gluten-free" must contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Gluten-Free Restaurants:</strong> Many European cities now boast dedicated gluten-free restaurants and cafes, offering everything from traditional dishes to modern cuisine.</li>
    <li><strong>Supermarket Options:</strong> Major supermarkets across Europe have expanded their gluten-free ranges, offering everything from bread and pasta to snacks and desserts.</li>
