    <h1>Gluten-Free in Spain: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Spain, known for its rich culinary traditions, might seem like a challenging destination for those following a gluten-free diet. However, with increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten intolerance, Spain has become a surprisingly accommodating country for gluten-free travelers. From dedicated gluten-free restaurants to widespread availability of gluten-free products, Spain offers a variety of options for those who need to avoid gluten. In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about navigating a gluten-free lifestyle in Spain.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Needs in Spain</h2>
    <p>Spain has seen a significant rise in awareness about gluten-related disorders over the past decade. Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, affects approximately 1% of the population in Spain. As a result, the country has made strides in providing gluten-free options in restaurants, supermarkets, and even in traditional Spanish cuisine. The Spanish Federation of Celiac Associations (FACE) plays a crucial role in certifying gluten-free products and educating the public about celiac disease.</p>
