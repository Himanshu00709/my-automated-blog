    <h1>Gluten-Free Food in Portugal: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Portugal, known for its rich culinary traditions, is a paradise for food lovers. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, navigating the food scene can be a challenge. Fortunately, Portugal has made significant strides in accommodating gluten-free diets, offering a variety of options that cater to those who need to avoid gluten. This guide will explore the gluten-free food landscape in Portugal, from traditional dishes to modern eateries, and provide practical tips for travelers and residents alike.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of health issues, from digestive problems to more severe autoimmune reactions. A gluten-free diet eliminates all foods containing gluten, which means avoiding many common staples like bread, pasta, and pastries. However, with the rise in awareness of gluten-related disorders, many countries, including Portugal, have embraced gluten-free alternatives.</p>

    <h2>Traditional Portuguese Cuisine and Gluten</h2>

    <p>Portuguese cuisine is heavily based on seafood, meat, and fresh vegetables, which are naturally gluten-free. However, many traditional dishes include gluten-containing ingredients. For example, "bacalhau à brás" (a codfish dish) often includes fried potatoes and eggs but may also contain flour. Similarly, "francesinha," a popular sandwich, is made with bread and a beer-based sauce, both of which contain gluten. Despite these challenges, many traditional dishes can be adapted to be gluten-free, and an increasing number of restaurants are offering gluten-free versions of these classics.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Options in Portuguese Restaurants</h2>

    <p>Portugal has seen a surge in gluten-free awareness, and many restaurants now offer gluten-free menus or are willing to accommodate dietary restrictions. In larger cities like Lisbon and Porto, you'll find a variety of gluten-free bakeries, cafes, and restaurants. Some popular gluten-free options include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Grilled Fish and Seafood:</strong> Portugal is famous for its fresh seafood, and dishes like grilled sardines or octopus are naturally gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Rice Dishes:</strong> "Arroz de marisco" (seafood rice) and "arroz de pato" (duck rice) are flavorful and gluten-free options.</li>
        <li><strong>Salads and Vegetables:</strong> Many Portuguese salads, such as "salada de polvo" (octopus salad), are gluten-free and packed with flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Products in Portuguese Supermarkets</h2>

    <p>For those who prefer to cook at home, Portuguese supermarkets offer a wide range of gluten-free products.

Additionally, health food stores and specialty shops often carry a broader selection of gluten-free items. Here’s a table of common gluten-free products you can find in Portuguese supermarkets:</p>
