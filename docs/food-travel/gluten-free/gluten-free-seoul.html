<h1>Gluten-Free Seoul: A Culinary Adventure</h1>

<p>Seoul, the vibrant capital of South Korea, is a city that seamlessly blends tradition with modernity. Known for its bustling streets, historic palaces, and cutting-edge technology, Seoul is also a haven for food lovers. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, navigating the culinary landscape can be a challenge. Fear not, for Seoul is increasingly becoming a gluten-free-friendly destination.

            <td>Request gluten-free soy sauce</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Kimchi</td>
            <td>Usually gluten-free</td>
            <td>Check for added sauces</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Japchae</td>
            <td>Contains wheat-based noodles</td>
            <td>Use sweet potato starch noodles</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Bulgogi</td>
            <td>May contain soy sauce</td>
