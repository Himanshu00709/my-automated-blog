    <h1>Gluten-Free Eating in Japan: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Japan is a country renowned for its rich culinary traditions, from sushi and ramen to tempura and yakitori. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, navigating Japanese cuisine can be a daunting task. Wheat, soy sauce, and other gluten-containing ingredients are staples in many Japanese dishes. But fear not! With a bit of knowledge and preparation, enjoying gluten-free eating in Japan is entirely possible.

Therefore, it's crucial to understand where gluten might be hiding in Japanese cuisine.</p>

                <td>Wheat flour batter</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Yakitori</td>
                <td>Soy sauce marinade</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Miso Soup</td>
