    <h1>Do Cake Cones Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of baked goods can be a challenge. One common question that arises is whether cake cones, a popular choice for ice cream and desserts, contain gluten. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of cake cones, explore their gluten content, and provide alternatives for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What Are Cake Cones?</h2>

    <p>Cake cones, also known as wafer cones, are a type of edible container often used to serve ice cream. They are made from a thin, crispy batter that is baked into a cone shape. Unlike sugar cones, which are thicker and sweeter, cake cones have a lighter texture and a more neutral flavor, making them a versatile option for various desserts.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Cake Cones</h2>

    <p>To determine whether cake cones contain gluten, it's essential to look at their ingredients. The primary components of cake cones typically include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Wheat flour</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Leavening agents (such as baking powder)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Flavorings (such as vanilla)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As you can see, wheat flour is a key ingredient in most cake cones. Wheat flour contains gluten, a protein that gives dough its elasticity and helps it rise. Therefore, traditional cake cones are not gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Cake Cones</h2>

    <p>For those who need to avoid gluten, there are several alternatives to traditional cake cones:</p>

            <tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>DIY Gluten-Free Cones</td>
