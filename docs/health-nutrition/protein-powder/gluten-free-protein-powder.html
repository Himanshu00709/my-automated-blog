These powders are particularly beneficial for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those who choose to avoid gluten for other health reasons. They are typically made from plant-based sources like peas, rice, or hemp, or from animal-based sources like whey or casein that have been processed to remove gluten.</p>
