    <h1>Does Kombucha Have Gluten? A Detailed Guide</h1>

        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Used as a food source for the SCOBY during fermentation. Sugar is also gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>SCOBY:</strong> The culture responsible for fermentation. It is gluten-free as it consists of bacteria and yeast.</li>
