    <h2>Why is Spirulina Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Spirulina is naturally gluten-free because it is an algae, not a grain. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and other related grains. Since spirulina is grown in water and does not come into contact with gluten-containing grains during cultivation or processing, it is inherently safe for those who need to avoid gluten. However, it is always important to check the label to ensure that the spirulina product has not been cross-contaminated during manufacturing.</p>

    <p>The high concentration of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants in spirulina helps strengthen the immune system, making it easier for the body to fight off infections and illnesses.</p>

    <h3>3. Improves Gut Health</h3>
    <p>Spirulina contains prebiotics that promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, supporting digestive health and improving nutrient absorption.</p>

    <h3>4. Enhances Energy Levels</h3>
    <p>Thanks to its high iron and B-vitamin content, spirulina can help combat fatigue and boost energy levels, making it an excellent supplement for athletes and active individuals.</p>

    <h3>5. Supports Detoxification</h3>
    <p>Spirulina has been shown to bind to heavy metals and toxins in the body, aiding in their removal and supporting liver health.</p>
