<h1>Protein Powder: Gluten-Free and Dairy-Free Options</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free and dairy-free protein powders has skyrocketed. Whether due to dietary restrictions, allergies, or personal health goals, more people are seeking plant-based and allergen-free alternatives to traditional protein supplements.

<p>Additionally, many gluten-free and dairy-free protein powders are derived from plant-based sources, making them suitable for vegans and vegetarians. These powders often contain a blend of proteins from peas, rice, hemp, and other plants, providing a complete amino acid profile that supports muscle repair and growth.</p>
