    <h1>Is Raw Honey Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Raw honey has been a staple in human diets for thousands of years, prized for its natural sweetness and numerous health benefits. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, many people are questioning whether raw honey is safe to consume. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free nature of raw honey, its benefits, and how to ensure you're choosing the right product for your dietary needs.</p>

        <li><strong>Flavored or Infused Honey:</strong> Some flavored or infused honey products may contain additives or flavorings that include gluten. Always check the label for any gluten-containing ingredients.</li>
    </ul>
