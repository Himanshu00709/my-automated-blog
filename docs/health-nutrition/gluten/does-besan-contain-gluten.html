    <h1>Does Besan Contain Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Besan, also known as gram flour or chickpea flour, is a staple ingredient in many cuisines, particularly in Indian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean cooking. It is widely used for making dishes like pakoras, dhokla, and even as a thickening agent in soups and stews. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets and the increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders, many people are questioning whether besan contains gluten. In this article, we will delve into the details of besan, its composition, and whether it is safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Besan?</h2>

    <p>Besan is a flour made from ground chickpeas, specifically the Bengal gram or chana dal. It is naturally gluten-free, as it is derived from legumes rather than grains. Chickpeas are a rich source of protein, fiber, and essential nutrients, making besan a nutritious alternative to wheat flour. Its versatility and nutritional profile have made it a popular choice for those looking to incorporate more plant-based proteins into their diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in certain grains, such as wheat, barley, and rye. It is responsible for the elastic texture of dough, allowing it to rise and maintain its shape. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergy, consuming gluten can lead to a range of health issues, including digestive problems, skin rashes, and even neurological symptoms.</p>

    <h2>Is Besan Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, besan is naturally gluten-free. Since it is made from chickpeas, which are legumes, it does not contain the gluten proteins found in wheat, barley, or rye. This makes besan a safe and nutritious option for individuals who need to follow a gluten-free diet. However, it is important to note that cross-contamination can occur during the processing or packaging of besan, especially if it is produced in facilities that also handle gluten-containing grains. Therefore, it is crucial to look for besan that is certified gluten-free if you have a severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>
