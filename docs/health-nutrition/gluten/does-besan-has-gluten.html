    <h1>Does Besan Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Besan, also known as gram flour or chickpea flour, is a staple ingredient in many cuisines, particularly in South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean cooking. It is widely used for making dishes like pakoras, falafel, and even desserts like besan ladoo. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets and the increasing awareness of gluten-related health issues, many people are asking: <strong>Does besan have gluten?</strong> In this article, we will explore this question in detail, providing you with all the information you need to make informed dietary choices.</p>

    <h2>What is Besan?</h2>

    <p>Besan is a flour made from ground chickpeas, specifically the Bengal gram or chana dal. It is naturally gluten-free, as it is derived from legumes rather than grains. Chickpeas are a rich source of protein, fiber, and essential nutrients, making besan a popular choice for those looking to add more plant-based protein to their diet. Its nutty flavor and versatility make it a favorite in both savory and sweet dishes.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in certain grains, such as wheat, barley, and rye. It is responsible for the elastic texture of dough, allowing it to rise and maintain its shape. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergy, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and autoimmune reactions.</p>

    <h2>Is Besan Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, besan is naturally gluten-free. Since it is made from chickpeas, which are legumes, it does not contain gluten. However, there are a few important considerations to keep in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> While besan itself is gluten-free, it can become contaminated with gluten if it is processed in facilities that also handle wheat, barley, or rye. Always check the packaging for a gluten-free certification to ensure that the product has not been cross-contaminated.</li>
        <li><strong>Additives:</strong> Some commercially available besan products may contain additives or fillers that contain gluten. Always read the ingredient list carefully to ensure that the product is 100% gluten-free.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Besan</h2>
