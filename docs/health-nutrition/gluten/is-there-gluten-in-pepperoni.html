    <h1>Is There Gluten in Pepperoni? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Pepperoni is a beloved topping for pizzas, sandwiches, and charcuterie boards. Its spicy, savory flavor makes it a favorite among many. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding whether pepperoni contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients in pepperoni, potential sources of gluten, and how to ensure you’re choosing gluten-free options.</p>

    <h2>What is Pepperoni Made Of?</h2>
    <p>Pepperoni is a type of salami that originated in the United States. It is typically made from a mixture of pork and beef, seasoned with spices such as paprika, garlic, and fennel. The meat is cured and fermented, which gives it its distinctive flavor and texture. However, the exact ingredients can vary depending on the brand and manufacturer.</p>

    <h3>Common Ingredients in Pepperoni:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork and/or beef</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Spices (paprika, garlic, fennel, etc.)</li>
        <li>Lactic acid starter culture</li>
        <li>Sodium nitrite (for preservation)</li>
        <li>Flavorings and additives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Does Pepperoni Contain Gluten?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It is commonly present in bread, pasta, and baked goods, but it can also be found in processed foods as a filler or binding agent. When it comes to pepperoni, the primary concern is whether gluten-containing ingredients are used during the manufacturing process.</p>

    <p>Most traditional pepperoni recipes do not include gluten-containing ingredients. However, some manufacturers may add fillers, flavorings, or preservatives that contain gluten. Additionally, cross-contamination can occur during processing if the pepperoni is produced in a facility that also handles gluten-containing products.</p>
