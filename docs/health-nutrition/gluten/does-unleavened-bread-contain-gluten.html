    <h1>Does Unleavened Bread Contain Gluten? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Unleavened bread has been a staple in many cultures for centuries, often associated with religious traditions and dietary practices. But for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether unleavened bread contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the composition of unleavened bread, its gluten content, and what it means for those following a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Unleavened Bread?</h2>

    <p>Unleavened bread is a type of bread that is made without the use of leavening agents such as yeast, baking powder, or baking soda. This results in a flat, dense bread that is often used in religious ceremonies, such as during Passover in Jewish tradition or in the Christian Eucharist. Common examples of unleavened bread include matzo, tortillas, and roti.</p>

    <h2>Does Unleavened Bread Contain Gluten?</h2>

    <p>The gluten content in unleavened bread depends on the type of flour used in its preparation. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. If unleavened bread is made from wheat flour, it will contain gluten. However, if it is made from gluten-free flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or chickpea flour, it will be gluten-free.</p>

    <p>Here’s a breakdown of common types of unleavened bread and their gluten content:</p>

                <td>Roti</td>
                <td>Whole Wheat Flour</td>
                <td>Contains Gluten</td>
            </tr>
