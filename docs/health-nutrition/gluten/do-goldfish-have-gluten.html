    <h1>Do Goldfish Have Gluten? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Goldfish crackers are a beloved snack for many, known for their cheesy flavor and fun fish shapes. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether goldfish contain gluten is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients of goldfish crackers, explore their gluten content, and provide answers to common questions about this popular snack.</p>

    <h2>What Are Goldfish Crackers Made Of?</h2>

    <p>Goldfish crackers are produced by Pepperidge Farm and come in a variety of flavors, including original cheddar, pretzel, and whole grain. The primary ingredients in the original cheddar flavor include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Enriched wheat flour</li>
        <li>Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Vegetable oils</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Leavening agents</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As you can see, the first ingredient is enriched wheat flour, which is a key indicator of gluten content. Wheat flour contains gluten, a protein that can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>Do Goldfish Crackers Contain Gluten?</h2>

    <p>Yes, traditional goldfish crackers contain gluten due to the use of enriched wheat flour. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it is responsible for the elasticity and chewiness of baked goods. For individuals who need to avoid gluten, consuming goldfish crackers can lead to symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.</p>

    <p>However, Pepperidge Farm has recognized the growing demand for gluten-free options and has introduced a line of gluten-free goldfish crackers. These crackers are made with alternative flours, such as rice flour and corn flour, which do not contain gluten.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Goldfish Crackers: A Safer Option</h2>

    <p>For those who need to avoid gluten, Pepperidge Farm offers gluten-free goldfish crackers in several flavors, including cheddar and pretzel. These crackers are made with gluten-free ingredients and are processed in a facility that takes precautions to avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing products.</p>

    <p>Here’s a comparison of the ingredients in traditional and gluten-free goldfish crackers:</p>
