For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals with these conditions to carefully monitor their gluten intake.</p>

    <h2>Is Special K Safe for People with Celiac Disease?</h2>

    <p>Given that Special K contains wheat gluten, it is not safe for individuals with celiac disease.

    <p>For individuals with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, the situation may be slightly different. Some people with gluten sensitivity may tolerate small amounts of gluten without experiencing severe symptoms.

If you have gluten sensitivity, it is best to consult with a healthcare professional before consuming Special K.</p>
