        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If peppers are processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing products, there is a risk of cross-contamination. This is particularly important for individuals with celiac disease, who must avoid even trace amounts of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings and Marinades:</strong> Peppers are often seasoned or marinated before cooking. Some seasonings and marinades may contain gluten, so it’s essential to verify the ingredients.</li>

        <li><strong>Read Labels:</strong> For processed pepper products, always read the ingredient list and look for gluten-free certifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Cross-Contamination:</strong> If you’re preparing peppers in a shared kitchen, use separate utensils, cutting boards, and cookware to prevent cross-contact with gluten-containing foods.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Your Own Sauces and Seasonings:</strong> By preparing your own sauces and seasonings, you can control the ingredients and ensure they are gluten-free.</li>
