    <h1>Does Salmon Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference. For those who need to avoid gluten, understanding which foods are safe to eat is crucial. One common question that arises is: <strong>Does salmon have gluten?</strong> In this article, we’ll explore the relationship between salmon and gluten, discuss potential sources of gluten contamination, and provide tips for ensuring your salmon is gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. It acts as a binding agent, giving dough its elasticity and helping it rise. For most people, gluten is harmless. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications.</p>

    <h2>Is Salmon Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Salmon, in its natural state, is a gluten-free food. It is a type of fish that does not contain gluten proteins. Whether you’re eating wild-caught or farm-raised salmon, the fish itself is free from gluten. However, the way salmon is prepared, cooked, or processed can introduce gluten into the dish. This is where things can get tricky for those on a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h3>Potential Sources of Gluten in Salmon Dishes</h3>
    <p>While salmon itself is gluten-free, there are several ways gluten can be introduced during preparation or cooking:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Marinades and Sauces:</strong> Many marinades and sauces contain gluten as a thickening agent. Soy sauce, for example, is a common ingredient in salmon recipes and often contains wheat.</li>
        <li><strong>Breading and Coatings:</strong> Some salmon dishes are breaded or coated with flour before cooking. This breading often contains gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If salmon is prepared in a kitchen where gluten-containing foods are also cooked, there is a risk of cross-contamination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Ensure Your Salmon is Gluten-Free</h2>
    <p>If you’re following a gluten-free diet, here are some tips to ensure your salmon remains gluten-free:</p>

                <td>Prepare at Home</td>
