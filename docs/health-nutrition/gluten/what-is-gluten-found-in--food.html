    <h1>What is Gluten Found In? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in certain grains that gives dough its elasticity and helps it rise and keep its shape. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause serious health issues. Understanding where gluten is found is crucial for managing a gluten-free diet. This article will explore the common and hidden sources of gluten, provide a detailed table of gluten-containing foods, and answer frequently asked questions about gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins, primarily gliadin and glutenin, found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. These proteins are responsible for the elastic texture of dough, allowing bread to rise and maintain its shape. While gluten is safe for most people, it can trigger an immune response in individuals with celiac disease, leading to damage in the small intestine. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity can also cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue.</p>

    <h2>Common Foods Containing Gluten</h2>
    <p>Gluten is most commonly found in foods made from wheat, barley, and rye. Here are some of the most common sources:</p>
