    <h1>Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free, Soy-Free Diet: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, dietary restrictions have become increasingly common due to food allergies, intolerances, and personal health choices. One such diet that has gained popularity is the gluten-free, dairy-free, and soy-free diet. This diet eliminates three major food groups that are known to cause adverse reactions in many individuals.
