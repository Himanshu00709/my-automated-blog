<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Products</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. What does "gluten-free" mean?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free means that a product does not contain gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Gluten-free products are safe for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergies.</p>

    <h3>2. Are gluten-free products healthier?</h3>
    <p>Not necessarily. While gluten-free products are essential for those with gluten-related disorders, they are not inherently healthier than their gluten-containing counterparts.

    <h3>3. Can I lose weight on a gluten-free diet?</h3>
    <p>A gluten-free diet is not a weight-loss diet. However, some people may lose weight initially because they are cutting out processed foods and refined carbohydrates. It’s important to focus on a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.</p>

    <h3>4. Are gluten-free products more expensive?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free products can be more expensive due to the cost of sourcing and producing gluten-free ingredients. However, the Gluten-Free Remedies Store offers competitive pricing and often has discounts and promotions to make gluten-free living more affordable.</p>
