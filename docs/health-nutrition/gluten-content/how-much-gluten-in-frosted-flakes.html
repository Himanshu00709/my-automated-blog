    <h1>How Much Gluten is in Frosted Flakes? A Detailed Analysis</h1>

    <p>Frosted Flakes, the iconic cereal known for its sweet, crunchy flakes and mascot Tony the Tiger, has been a breakfast staple for decades. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, understanding the gluten content in Frosted Flakes is crucial. This article delves into the gluten content of Frosted Flakes, its ingredients, and what it means for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, knowing whether a product like Frosted Flakes contains gluten is essential for those who need to maintain a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Frosted Flakes</h2>

    <p>To determine the gluten content in Frosted Flakes, it's important to first look at the ingredients list. The primary ingredients in Frosted Flakes include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Milled corn</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Malt flavoring</li>
        <li>High fructose corn syrup</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Vitamins and minerals</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, the main ingredient, milled corn, is naturally gluten-free. However, the presence of malt flavoring raises a red flag for those avoiding gluten. Malt flavoring is typically derived from barley, which contains gluten. This means that Frosted Flakes are not gluten-free and should be avoided by individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>Gluten Content in Frosted Flakes</h2>

    <p>While Frosted Flakes are not marketed as a gluten-free product, it's important to quantify the gluten content to understand the potential risk. According to the FDA, foods labeled as "gluten-free" must contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. Frosted Flakes, however, contain malt flavoring derived from barley, which means they exceed this threshold.</p>

                <td>Contains Gluten (Barley)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>High Fructose Corn Syrup</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vitamins and Minerals</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As shown in the table, the malt flavoring in Frosted Flakes is the primary source of gluten. This makes the cereal unsuitable for those on a strict gluten-free diet.</p>
