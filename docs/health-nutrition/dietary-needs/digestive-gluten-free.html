    <h1>Understanding Digestive Health with a Gluten-Free Diet</h1>
    <p>Digestive health is a cornerstone of overall well-being, and for many individuals, adopting a gluten-free diet can be a game-changer. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause significant digestive issues for those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or other related conditions. This article delves into the intricacies of digestive health and how a gluten-free diet can help alleviate symptoms, improve gut health, and enhance quality of life.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Does It Affect Digestive Health?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins that give elasticity to dough, helping it rise and maintain its shape. While gluten is harmless for most people, it can trigger adverse reactions in individuals with certain conditions. Celiac disease, for instance, is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. This damage can result in malabsorption of nutrients, leading to a host of digestive and systemic issues.</p>
    <p>Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is another condition where individuals experience symptoms similar to celiac disease but without the intestinal damage. Symptoms can include bloating, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain. For these individuals, a gluten-free diet can significantly improve digestive health and overall well-being.</p>

    <h2>The Role of a Gluten-Free Diet in Digestive Health</h2>
    <p>Adopting a gluten-free diet involves eliminating all sources of gluten from your meals. This means avoiding foods like bread, pasta, cereals, and baked goods made with wheat, barley, or rye. Instead, individuals can opt for gluten-free alternatives such as rice, quinoa, corn, and gluten-free oats.</p>
    <p>For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, a gluten-free diet can lead to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduction in digestive symptoms such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea</li>
        <li>Healing of the intestinal lining</li>
        <li>Improved nutrient absorption</li>
        <li>Enhanced energy levels and overall health</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Gluten-Free Foods and Their Benefits</h2>
    <p>Transitioning to a gluten-free diet doesn't mean sacrificing taste or nutrition. There are plenty of naturally gluten-free foods that are both delicious and beneficial for digestive health. Below is a table highlighting some common gluten-free foods and their benefits:</p>
