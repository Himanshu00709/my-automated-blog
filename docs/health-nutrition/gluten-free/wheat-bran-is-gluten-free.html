<h1>Is Wheat Bran Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Wheat bran is a popular dietary fiber source known for its numerous health benefits, including improved digestion and heart health. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether wheat bran is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will explore the relationship between wheat bran and gluten, its nutritional profile, and alternatives for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

<h2>What is Wheat Bran?</h2>

<p>Wheat bran is the outer layer of the wheat kernel, which is removed during the milling process to produce refined flour. It is rich in dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals, making it a valuable addition to a healthy diet. Wheat bran is commonly used in cereals, bread, and baked goods to boost their fiber content.</p>

<h2>Is Wheat Bran Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, wheat bran is not gluten-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Since wheat bran is derived from wheat, it inherently contains gluten. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming wheat bran can trigger adverse reactions, including digestive issues, fatigue, and nutrient malabsorption.</p>
