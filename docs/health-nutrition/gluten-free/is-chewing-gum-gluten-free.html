In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients in chewing gum, identify potential sources of gluten, and provide a detailed guide to help you make informed choices.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Does It Matter?</h2>

        <li><strong>Sweeteners:</strong> These can include sugar, artificial sweeteners like aspartame, or natural sweeteners like xylitol.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavorings:</strong> Natural or artificial flavors to provide taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Softening Agents:</strong> Such as glycerin or vegetable oil, to maintain moisture and texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Colorings:</strong> Used to give gum its appealing appearance.</li>
