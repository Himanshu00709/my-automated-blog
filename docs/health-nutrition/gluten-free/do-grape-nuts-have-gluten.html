<h1>Do Grape Nuts Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Grape Nuts, a popular cereal known for its crunchy texture and nutty flavor, has been a breakfast staple for many households for decades. However, with the rise in gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, many people are questioning whether Grape Nuts contain gluten. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of Grape Nuts, explore whether they are gluten-free, and provide valuable insights for those following a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

<h2>What Are Grape Nuts?</h2>

<p>Grape Nuts is a cereal product made by Post Consumer Brands. Despite its name, Grape Nuts contain neither grapes nor nuts. The cereal is made from whole grain wheat flour and malted barley flour, which are baked into small, crunchy nuggets. The name "Grape Nuts" is believed to have originated from the cereal's nutty flavor and the grape sugar (glucose) used in its production.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It acts as a binding agent, giving dough its elasticity and helping it rise. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and skin problems. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to avoid foods containing gluten.</p>

<h2>Do Grape Nuts Contain Gluten?</h2>

<h3>Ingredients in Grape Nuts</h3>

<p>To better understand why Grape Nuts are not gluten-free, let's take a closer look at their ingredients:</p>

<table>

            <th>Source of Gluten</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
