    <h1>Is Asparagus Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Asparagus is a popular vegetable known for its unique flavor and numerous health benefits.

In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of asparagus, its nutritional benefits, and how to incorporate it safely into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Does It Matter?</h2>

This makes it a safe and healthy option for individuals who need to avoid gluten. However, it's important to consider how asparagus is prepared and served, as cross-contamination with gluten-containing ingredients can occur during cooking or processing.</p>
