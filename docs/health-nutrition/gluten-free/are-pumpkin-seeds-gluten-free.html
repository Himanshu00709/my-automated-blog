    <h1>Are Pumpkin Seeds Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Pumpkin seeds, also known as pepitas, are a popular snack and ingredient in many dishes. They are packed with nutrients, including magnesium, zinc, and healthy fats. But for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether pumpkin seeds are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of pumpkin seeds, their nutritional benefits, and how to safely incorporate them into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Does Gluten-Free Mean?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and autoimmune reactions. A gluten-free diet eliminates all sources of gluten, which means avoiding foods that contain these grains or are processed in facilities that handle them.</p>

    <h2>Are Pumpkin Seeds Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Yes, pumpkin seeds are naturally gluten-free. They are seeds from the pumpkin fruit and do not contain any gluten proteins. However, the gluten-free status of pumpkin seeds can be compromised during processing, packaging, or cross-contamination. It is essential to check the label for any gluten-containing ingredients or warnings about shared facilities.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Pumpkin Seeds</h2>
    <p>Pumpkin seeds are a powerhouse of nutrition. Here are some of the key nutrients they provide:</p>
