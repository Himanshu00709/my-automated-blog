    <h1>Do Rice Crackers Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Rice crackers are a popular snack enjoyed by many, especially those looking for a light, crunchy alternative to traditional chips or crackers. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance, celiac disease, or those following a gluten-free diet, the question of whether rice crackers contain gluten is of utmost importance. In this article, we will delve into the composition of rice crackers, explore their gluten content, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision about including them in your diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Rice Crackers Made Of?</h2>

    <p>Rice crackers are primarily made from rice, which is naturally gluten-free. The basic ingredients include rice flour, water, and sometimes salt or other seasonings. The rice is typically puffed or pressed into thin, crispy sheets and then baked or fried to create the final product. However, the simplicity of the ingredients can sometimes be misleading, as additional flavorings or additives may introduce gluten into the product.</p>

    <h2>Are Rice Crackers Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>In their purest form, rice crackers are gluten-free. However, the gluten-free status of rice crackers can be compromised during the manufacturing process. Cross-contamination is a common issue in facilities that process both gluten-containing and gluten-free products. Additionally, some rice crackers may contain added ingredients such as soy sauce, malt flavoring, or other seasonings that contain gluten. Therefore, it is crucial to read the ingredient list and look for a gluten-free certification on the packaging to ensure that the product is safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>
