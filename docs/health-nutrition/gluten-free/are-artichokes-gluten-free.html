    <h1>Are Artichokes Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Artichokes are a delicious and nutritious vegetable that has been enjoyed for centuries. Known for their unique flavor and numerous health benefits, artichokes are a staple in many diets. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, it's crucial to know whether artichokes are safe to consume. In this article, we will explore whether artichokes are gluten-free, their nutritional benefits, and how to incorporate them into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Artichokes?</h2>

    <p>Artichokes, scientifically known as <em>Cynara scolymus</em>, are a type of thistle that is cultivated for its edible flower buds.

    <p>However, it's important to be cautious about how artichokes are prepared and served. While the vegetable itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur if artichokes are processed or cooked in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products. Always check labels and ask about preparation methods when dining out to ensure that your artichokes remain gluten-free.</p>
