    <h1>Is Pineapple Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Pineapple is a tropical fruit known for its sweet and tangy flavor, making it a favorite in many diets. But for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether pineapple is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of pineapple, its nutritional benefits, and how to safely incorporate it into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It acts as a binding agent, giving dough its elasticity and helping it rise. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine.</p>

    <h2>Is Pineapple Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Yes, pineapple is naturally gluten-free. As a fruit, it does not contain any gluten proteins. This makes it a safe and healthy option for those following a gluten-free diet. However, it's essential to consider how pineapple is processed and prepared, as cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing or cooking.</p>

    <p>Pineapple is not only gluten-free but also packed with essential nutrients. Here are some of the key nutritional benefits of pineapple:</p>
