<h1>Do Sesame Seeds Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference. For those who must avoid gluten, understanding which foods are safe to consume is crucial. One common question that arises is whether sesame seeds contain gluten. In this article, we will explore the relationship between sesame seeds and gluten, providing you with the information you need to make informed dietary choices.</p>

<h2>What Are Sesame Seeds?</h2>

<p>Sesame seeds are tiny, oil-rich seeds that come from the sesame plant (<em>Sesamum indicum</em>). They are widely used in various cuisines around the world, particularly in Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean dishes. Sesame seeds are known for their nutty flavor and are often used as a topping for bread, bagels, and salads. They are also a key ingredient in tahini, a paste used in hummus and other dishes.</p>

<p>Sesame seeds are highly nutritious, containing a good amount of protein, healthy fats, fiber, and essential minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and iron. They are also rich in antioxidants, which can help protect your body from oxidative stress.</p>

<h2>Do Sesame Seeds Contain Gluten?</h2>

<p>The short answer is no, sesame seeds do not naturally contain gluten. Gluten is a group of proteins found in certain grains, such as wheat, barley, and rye. Since sesame seeds are not grains but rather seeds, they are inherently gluten-free.</p>

<p>However, it's important to consider the possibility of cross-contamination. Sesame seeds may come into contact with gluten-containing grains during harvesting, processing, or packaging. This is especially true if the sesame seeds are processed in facilities that also handle wheat or other gluten-containing products.</p>

<p>To ensure that sesame seeds are safe for a gluten-free diet, it's essential to look for products that are labeled as "gluten-free." This label indicates that the product has been tested and meets the strict standards for gluten-free certification, typically containing less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Profile of Sesame Seeds</h2>

<p>Sesame seeds are not only gluten-free but also packed with nutrients. Here's a breakdown of the nutritional content of sesame seeds per 100 grams:</p>
