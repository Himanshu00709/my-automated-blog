    <h1>Are Green Peas Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Green peas are a staple in many diets around the world, known for their versatility, nutritional value, and delicious taste. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, determining whether green peas are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of green peas, their nutritional benefits, potential cross-contamination risks, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Does It Matter?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and autoimmune reactions. Therefore, understanding which foods are gluten-free is essential for maintaining a healthy diet.</p>

    <h2>Are Green Peas Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, green peas are naturally gluten-free. They are a type of legume, not a grain, and do not contain gluten proteins. Green peas are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, making them a nutritious addition to any diet. However, while green peas themselves are gluten-free, there are some considerations to keep in mind, especially when it comes to processed or packaged pea products.</p>

    <h3>Nutritional Benefits of Green Peas</h3>

    <p>Green peas are packed with essential nutrients that contribute to overall health. Here are some key nutritional benefits:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Nutrient</th>
                <th>Amount per 100g</th>
                <th>Benefits</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>

    <h2>Potential Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>While green peas are naturally gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during processing, packaging, or preparation. For example, green peas processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing grains may be at risk of contamination. Additionally, pre-packaged pea products, such as pea flour or pea protein powder, may be processed in shared facilities, increasing the risk of gluten exposure.</p>

    <p>To minimize the risk of cross-contamination, it is essential to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Choose certified gluten-free products when available.</li>
        <li>Read product labels carefully to check for any gluten-containing ingredients or allergen warnings.</li>
        <li>Contact manufacturers directly if you are unsure about the gluten-free status of a product.</li>
    </ul>
