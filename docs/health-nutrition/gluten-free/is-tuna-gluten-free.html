    <h1>Is Tuna Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, maintaining a gluten-free diet is essential for health and well-being. One common question that arises is whether tuna, a staple in many diets, is gluten-free. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of tuna, potential sources of gluten contamination, and tips for safely incorporating tuna into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is responsible for the elastic texture of dough and is commonly found in bread, pasta, cereals, and many processed foods. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and long-term health complications.</p>

    <h2>Is Tuna Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Fresh, unprocessed tuna is naturally gluten-free. Tuna is a type of fish, and like other fish, it does not contain gluten in its natural state. However, the way tuna is processed, packaged, and prepared can introduce gluten into the product. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the form in which tuna is consumed.</p>
