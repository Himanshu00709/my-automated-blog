    <h1>Is Masago Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Masago, the tiny, vibrant orange fish roe commonly used in sushi, has become a popular ingredient in many dishes. Whether you're a sushi enthusiast or someone exploring gluten-free diets, you might be wondering: <strong>Is masago gluten-free?</strong> This article delves into the details of masago, its ingredients, and whether it fits into a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>What is Masago?</h2>
    <p>Masago is the roe (eggs) of the capelin fish, a small fish found in the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. It is often used as a garnish or ingredient in sushi, sashimi, and other Japanese dishes. Masago is known for its bright orange color, slightly crunchy texture, and mild, briny flavor. It is a popular alternative to more expensive fish roe like tobiko (flying fish roe) and ikura (salmon roe).</p>

    <h2>Is Masago Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>In its purest form, masago is naturally gluten-free. Fish roe, like masago, is a protein-rich food that does not contain gluten. However, the gluten-free status of masago can be compromised during processing and preparation. Many manufacturers add ingredients like soy sauce, artificial coloring, or preservatives, which may contain gluten. Therefore, it's essential to check the label or inquire about the ingredients used in the masago you're consuming.</p>

    <h2>Common Ingredients in Masago</h2>
    <p>To better understand whether masago is gluten-free, let's take a closer look at the typical ingredients used in its preparation:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Capelin Roe</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
