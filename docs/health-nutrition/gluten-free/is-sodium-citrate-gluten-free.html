<h1>Is Sodium Citrate Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by the increasing prevalence of celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and the growing popularity of gluten-free diets. For individuals who must avoid gluten, understanding the gluten-free status of food additives like sodium citrate is crucial. Sodium citrate is a common ingredient in many processed foods, but is it safe for those on a gluten-free diet? This article delves into the details of sodium citrate, its uses, and whether it is gluten-free.</p>

<h2>What is Sodium Citrate?</h2>

<p>Sodium citrate is the sodium salt of citric acid, a naturally occurring acid found in citrus fruits. It is widely used in the food industry as a preservative, flavoring agent, and emulsifier. Sodium citrate is also used in medical settings as an anticoagulant and to treat metabolic acidosis. Its versatility makes it a popular ingredient in a variety of products, from cheeses and beverages to pharmaceuticals.</p>

<h2>Is Sodium Citrate Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>The short answer is yes, sodium citrate is gluten-free. Sodium citrate is derived from citric acid, which is naturally gluten-free. The manufacturing process of sodium citrate does not involve any gluten-containing ingredients, making it safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it is always important to check the source and manufacturing process of any food additive, as cross-contamination can occur in facilities that also process gluten-containing products.</p>

<h2>Uses of Sodium Citrate in Food</h2>

<p>Sodium citrate is a versatile ingredient with a wide range of applications in the food industry. Below is a table summarizing its common uses:</p>
