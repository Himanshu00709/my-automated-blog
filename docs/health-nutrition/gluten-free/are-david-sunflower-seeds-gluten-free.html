<h1>Are David Sunflower Seeds Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply choosing a gluten-free lifestyle, understanding which foods are safe to consume is crucial. Sunflower seeds are a popular snack, and David Sunflower Seeds are among the most recognized brands. But are David Sunflower Seeds gluten-free? This article delves into the details, providing you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even small amounts of gluten can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. Therefore, it's essential for those affected to avoid gluten entirely.</p>

<p>Gluten sensitivity, while not as severe as celiac disease, can also cause discomfort and health issues. As a result, many people choose to follow a gluten-free diet to improve their overall well-being.</p>

<h2>Are David Sunflower Seeds Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>David Sunflower Seeds are a popular snack, known for their quality and variety of flavors. The good news is that most David Sunflower Seeds are gluten-free.
