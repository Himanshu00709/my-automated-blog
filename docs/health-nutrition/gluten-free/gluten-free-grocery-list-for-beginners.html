<h1>Gluten-Free Grocery List for Beginners</h1>

<p>Transitioning to a gluten-free diet can feel overwhelming, especially if you're new to the concept. Whether you're managing celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply exploring a healthier lifestyle, having a well-planned gluten-free grocery list is essential. This guide will walk you through the basics of gluten-free shopping, providing you with a comprehensive list of foods to include and avoid, along with tips to make your transition smoother.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten and Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems. Even for those without these conditions, reducing gluten intake can sometimes improve digestion and overall well-being. However, going gluten-free requires careful planning to ensure you're still getting all the necessary nutrients.</p>
