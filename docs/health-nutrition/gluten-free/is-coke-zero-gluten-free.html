    <p>None of these ingredients contain gluten, which is a positive sign for those avoiding gluten. However, it's important to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process.</p>

    <h2>Is Coke Zero Certified Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>While the ingredients in Coke Zero do not contain gluten, the beverage is not certified gluten-free by any major gluten-free certification organization. This means that while the product is unlikely to contain gluten, there is no official guarantee that it is entirely free from cross-contamination. For individuals with severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, this lack of certification may be a concern.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free products are manufactured in facilities that also process gluten-containing products. Although Coca-Cola has not publicly disclosed detailed information about their manufacturing processes, it is generally understood that their beverages are produced in dedicated facilities that do not handle gluten-containing ingredients. This reduces the risk of cross-contamination, but it does not eliminate it entirely.</p>

    <h2>What Do Experts Say?</h2>

    <p>Many experts in the field of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity agree that Coke Zero is likely safe for individuals who need to avoid gluten. The absence of gluten-containing ingredients and the low risk of cross-contamination make it a low-risk beverage. However, experts also recommend that individuals with severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease consult with their healthcare provider before consuming any product that is not certified gluten-free.</p>
