    <h1>Are Cheerios Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Cheerios, the iconic breakfast cereal, has been a staple in households for decades. Known for their heart-healthy benefits and versatility, Cheerios have become a favorite among both children and adults. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, many people are asking: <strong>Are Cheerios gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the gluten-free status of Cheerios, how they are made, and what you need to know before adding them to your gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Does Gluten-Free Mean?</h2>

    <p>Before we discuss Cheerios, it’s important to understand what "gluten-free" means. Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. A gluten-free diet eliminates all sources of gluten, requiring careful scrutiny of food labels and ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Are Cheerios Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The short answer is <strong>yes</strong>, Cheerios are considered gluten-free. However, the story is more nuanced than a simple yes or no. General Mills, the manufacturer of Cheerios, has developed a process to remove gluten from oats, which are naturally gluten-free but often contaminated with gluten during farming and processing. Here’s how they do it:</p>

    <h3>The Gluten-Free Process</h3>

    <p>General Mills uses a proprietary method called <strong>mechanical sorting</strong> to separate gluten-containing grains (like wheat, barley, and rye) from oats. This process involves advanced optical sorting technology that identifies and removes gluten-containing grains, ensuring that the final product contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, the FDA’s threshold for gluten-free labeling.</p>
