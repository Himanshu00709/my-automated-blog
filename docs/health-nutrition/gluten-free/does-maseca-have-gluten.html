<h1>Does Maseca Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Maseca is a popular brand of masa harina, a type of corn flour used to make traditional Mexican dishes like tortillas, tamales, and gorditas. For individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding whether Maseca contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we will explore the composition of Maseca, its gluten content, and its suitability for a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What is Maseca?</h2>

<p>Maseca is a brand of masa harina, which is a finely ground flour made from dried corn kernels that have been treated with lime (calcium hydroxide) in a process called nixtamalization.

Maseca is widely used in Latin American cuisine and has gained popularity worldwide due to its versatility and ease of use.</p>

<h2>Does Maseca Contain Gluten?</h2>

<p>The primary ingredient in Maseca is corn, which is naturally gluten-free. However, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process if the product is processed in facilities that also handle wheat, barley, or rye. According to the manufacturer, Maseca is produced in dedicated facilities that do not process gluten-containing grains, making it safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

<p>It is important to note that while Maseca itself is gluten-free, the final product (such as tortillas or tamales) may contain gluten if other ingredients are added during preparation. Always check the labels of additional ingredients and ensure that they are also gluten-free.</p>
