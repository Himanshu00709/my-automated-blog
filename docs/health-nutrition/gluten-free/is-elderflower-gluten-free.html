<h1>Is Elderflower Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Elderflower, known for its delicate aroma and versatile uses in culinary and medicinal applications, has gained popularity in recent years. Whether used in teas, syrups, or cocktails, elderflower offers a unique flavor profile that appeals to many. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Is elderflower gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of elderflower, its uses, and how to ensure you’re consuming it safely.</p>

<h2>What is Elderflower?</h2>

<p>Elderflower refers to the blossoms of the elder tree, scientifically known as <em>Sambucus nigra</em>. These small, creamy-white flowers are often harvested in late spring and early summer.

The flowers are also known for their potential health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.</p>
