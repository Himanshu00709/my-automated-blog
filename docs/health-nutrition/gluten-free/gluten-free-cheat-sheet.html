    <h1>Gluten-Free Cheat Sheet: Your Ultimate Guide to a Gluten-Free Lifestyle</h1>

    <p>Adopting a gluten-free lifestyle can be a daunting task, especially if you're new to it. Whether you're managing celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply choosing to avoid gluten for health reasons, having a reliable gluten-free cheat sheet can make the transition smoother. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about going gluten-free, from understanding what gluten is to identifying safe foods and avoiding hidden sources of gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It acts as a binding agent, giving dough its elasticity and helping it rise. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>There are several reasons why someone might choose to go gluten-free:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Celiac Disease:</strong> An autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity:</strong> A condition where individuals experience symptoms similar to celiac disease but without the intestinal damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Wheat Allergy:</strong> An allergic reaction to proteins found in wheat, which may include gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Health and Wellness:</strong> Some people choose a gluten-free diet for perceived health benefits, such as improved digestion or increased energy levels.</li>
    </ul>
