    <h1>Is Feta Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Feta cheese is a staple in Mediterranean cuisine, known for its tangy flavor and crumbly texture. But for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question arises: Is feta gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore the gluten content in feta cheese, how it’s made, and what to look for when purchasing feta to ensure it’s safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Feta Cheese?</h2>

    <p>Feta cheese is a brined curd cheese traditionally made from sheep’s milk or a mixture of sheep and goat’s milk. It originates from Greece and is protected by the European Union’s Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status, meaning that only cheese produced in specific regions of Greece can be labeled as "feta." The cheese is known for its salty taste and crumbly texture, making it a popular ingredient in salads, pastries, and various Mediterranean dishes.</p>

    <h2>Is Feta Cheese Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, feta cheese is naturally gluten-free. The primary ingredients in feta cheese are milk, salt, and bacterial cultures. None of these ingredients contain gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. However, there are some factors to consider when determining whether a particular feta cheese is safe for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>

    <h3>Potential Sources of Gluten Contamination</h3>

    <p>While feta cheese itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. Here are some potential sources of gluten contamination:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Shared Equipment:</strong> If feta cheese is produced in a facility that also processes gluten-containing products, there is a risk of cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Additives:</strong> Some manufacturers may add flavorings or preservatives to feta cheese that contain gluten. Always check the ingredient list for any additives.</li>
        <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> In rare cases, gluten can be introduced through the packaging materials used for the cheese.</li>
    </ul>
