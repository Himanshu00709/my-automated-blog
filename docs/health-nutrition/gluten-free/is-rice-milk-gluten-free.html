    <h1>Is Rice Milk Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Rice milk has become a popular alternative to dairy milk, especially among those with dietary restrictions or preferences. Whether you're lactose intolerant, vegan, or simply looking for a lighter option, rice milk offers a versatile and nutritious choice. But for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, the question remains: <strong>Is rice milk gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free status of rice milk, its nutritional profile, and how it compares to other plant-based milk alternatives.</p>

    <h2>What is Rice Milk?</h2>

    <p>Rice milk is a plant-based milk made from milled rice and water. It is naturally lactose-free, making it a suitable option for those who are lactose intolerant or allergic to dairy. The production process involves soaking, blending, and straining rice to create a smooth, creamy liquid. Some brands may add vitamins, minerals, or sweeteners to enhance flavor and nutritional value.</p>

    <p>Rice milk is known for its mild, slightly sweet taste, which makes it a versatile ingredient in cooking, baking, and beverages. However, its nutritional profile differs significantly from dairy milk and other plant-based alternatives, which we’ll discuss later in this article.</p>

    <h2>Is Rice Milk Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The short answer is <strong>yes</strong>, rice milk is naturally gluten-free. Rice is a gluten-free grain, and when processed into milk, it retains this property. However, there are a few important considerations to keep in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> While rice itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during processing or packaging if the facility also handles gluten-containing products. Always check the label for a "gluten-free" certification to ensure safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Added Ingredients:</strong> Some rice milk brands may include additives, thickeners, or flavorings that contain gluten. Be sure to read the ingredient list carefully.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, it’s crucial to choose rice milk that is certified gluten-free to avoid any risk of contamination.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Profile of Rice Milk</h2>

    <p>Rice milk is often praised for its light texture and hypoallergenic properties, but how does it stack up nutritionally? Below is a comparison of rice milk with other popular plant-based milk alternatives:</p>
