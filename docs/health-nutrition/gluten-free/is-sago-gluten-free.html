<h1>Is Sago Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Sago is a starch extracted from the pith of tropical palm stems, primarily the sago palm (<em>Metroxylon sagu</em>). It is a popular ingredient in various cuisines, especially in Southeast Asia, where it is used to make puddings, noodles, and other dishes. For individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding whether sago is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free nature of sago, its nutritional profile, and its uses in a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What is Sago?</h2>

<p>Sago is a starch that is derived from the pith of the sago palm. It is a staple food in many parts of the world, particularly in regions where the sago palm is abundant. The starch is extracted by cutting the palm trunk, crushing the pith, and washing it to separate the starch from the fibrous material. The resulting starch is then dried and processed into various forms, such as pearls, flour, or flakes.</p>

<p>Sago is often confused with tapioca, which is derived from the cassava plant. While both are starches and share some similarities, they come from different plants and have slightly different properties. Sago is commonly used in desserts, puddings, and as a thickening agent in soups and sauces.</p>

<h2>Is Sago Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Yes, sago is naturally gluten-free. Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. Since sago is derived from the sago palm, which is not related to these gluten-containing grains, it does not contain gluten. This makes sago a safe option for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

<p>However, it is essential to ensure that the sago you purchase is not contaminated with gluten during processing or packaging. Cross-contamination can occur if the sago is processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products. Therefore, it is advisable to look for sago products that are certified gluten-free by reputable organizations.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Profile of Sago</h2>

<p>Sago is primarily composed of carbohydrates, with very little protein, fat, or fiber. It is a high-energy food, making it a good source of quick energy. Below is a table summarizing the nutritional content of sago per 100 grams:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Nutrient</th>
        <th>Amount</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Calories</td>
