    <h1>Does Seaweed Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Seaweed has gained immense popularity in recent years, thanks to its nutritional benefits and versatility in culinary applications. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding whether seaweed contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we will explore the relationship between seaweed and gluten, delve into the types of seaweed, and provide practical advice for those following a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It acts as a binding agent, giving dough its elasticity and helping it rise. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and autoimmune reactions.</p>

    <h2>Is Seaweed Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Seaweed, in its natural form, is inherently gluten-free. It is a marine plant that grows in oceans and seas, and it does not contain any gluten proteins. However, the gluten-free status of seaweed can be compromised during processing, packaging, or preparation. Cross-contamination with gluten-containing ingredients is a common concern, especially in products like seaweed snacks, sushi wraps, and seasonings.</p>

    <h2>Types of Seaweed and Their Gluten Content</h2>
    <p>There are several types of seaweed commonly consumed worldwide. Below is a table summarizing the gluten content of popular seaweed varieties:</p>
