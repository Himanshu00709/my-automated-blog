    <h1>Is Shrimp Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, understanding which foods are safe to eat is crucial. Shrimp, a popular seafood choice, often raises questions about its gluten content. In this article, we will explore whether shrimp is gluten-free, potential sources of gluten contamination, and how to enjoy shrimp safely on a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It acts as a binding agent, giving elasticity to dough and helping it rise. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions.</p>

    <h2>Is Shrimp Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Yes, shrimp is naturally gluten-free. Shrimp is a type of shellfish that does not contain gluten in its natural state. However, the way shrimp is processed, prepared, and cooked can introduce gluten into the final product. It's essential to consider these factors when determining whether shrimp is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten Contamination in Shrimp</h2>
    <p>While shrimp itself is gluten-free, there are several ways it can become contaminated with gluten:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Source</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Breading and Coatings</td>
                <td>Many shrimp dishes, such as fried shrimp or shrimp tempura, are coated with breading that contains gluten. Always check the ingredients or ask about the preparation method.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sauces and Marinades</td>
                <td>Some sauces and marinades used in shrimp dishes may contain gluten. Soy sauce, for example, often contains wheat. Look for gluten-free alternatives or make your own at home.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cross-Contamination</td>
                <td>In restaurants or during processing, shrimp may come into contact with gluten-containing foods. This can happen on shared cooking surfaces, fryers, or utensils.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
