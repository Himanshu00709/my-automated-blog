    <h1>Are Grape Nuts Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Grape Nuts, a popular cereal known for its crunchy texture and nutty flavor, has been a breakfast staple for many households for over a century. However, with the increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders and the growing demand for gluten-free products, many consumers are left wondering: Are Grape Nuts gluten-free?

    <h2>What Are Grape Nuts Made Of?</h2>

    <p>Grape Nuts is a whole-grain cereal made primarily from whole wheat flour and malted barley flour. These ingredients are combined to create the cereal's signature dense and crunchy texture. While the name might suggest the presence of grapes or nuts, Grape Nuts contains neither. Instead, the name is derived from the cereal's nutty flavor and the grape sugar (glucose) used in its production.</p>

    <p>Here is a breakdown of the primary ingredients in Grape Nuts:</p>
