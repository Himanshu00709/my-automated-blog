    <h1>Gluten-Free Lax: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by an increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders such as celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergies. Among the many gluten-free options available, gluten-free laxatives (often referred to as "gluten-free lax") have gained significant attention. This article delves into the world of gluten-free laxatives, exploring their benefits, types, and considerations for those who need them.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Laxatives?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free laxatives are over-the-counter or prescription medications designed to relieve constipation without containing any gluten-derived ingredients. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Therefore, it is crucial for these individuals to ensure that any medication they take, including laxatives, is free from gluten.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Laxatives?</h2>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. When it comes to laxatives, choosing a gluten-free option ensures that the medication does not exacerbate these symptoms. Additionally, gluten-free laxatives are often made with natural ingredients, making them a safer choice for those with dietary restrictions.</p>

    <h2>Types of Gluten-Free Laxatives</h2>

    <p>There are several types of gluten-free laxatives available, each with its own mechanism of action. Below is a table summarizing the most common types:</p>
