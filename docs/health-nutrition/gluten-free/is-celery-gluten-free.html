    <h1>Is Celery Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, gluten-free diets have gained significant attention, especially among individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply looking to improve their overall health. One common question that arises is whether certain foods, like celery, are gluten-free. In this article, we will delve into the details of celery, its nutritional profile, and whether it is safe for those following a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Celery?</h2>

    <p>Celery (Apium graveolens) is a crunchy, low-calorie vegetable that belongs to the Apiaceae family. It is widely consumed raw, cooked, or as a flavoring agent in soups, stews, and salads. Celery is known for its high water content, dietary fiber, and essential nutrients such as vitamin K, vitamin C, potassium, and folate. Its unique flavor and versatility make it a popular choice in various cuisines around the world.</p>

    <h2>Is Celery Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, celery is naturally gluten-free. Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. Since celery is a vegetable and not a grain, it does not contain gluten. This makes celery a safe and healthy option for individuals who need to avoid gluten in their diet.</p>

    <p>However, it is important to note that while celery itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during processing, packaging, or preparation. For example, if celery is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing products, there is a risk of cross-contact. Therefore, it is crucial to read labels carefully and choose certified gluten-free products when available.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Celery</h2>

    <p>Celery is not only gluten-free but also packed with numerous health benefits. Below is a table summarizing the key nutritional components of celery:</p>
