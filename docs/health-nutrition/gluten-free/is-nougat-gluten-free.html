<h1>Is Nougat Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Nougat is a beloved confectionery treat that has been enjoyed for centuries. Its chewy texture and sweet flavor make it a favorite in many desserts and candy bars. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether nougat is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will delve into the composition of nougat, explore its gluten content, and provide guidance for those who need to avoid gluten in their diet.</p>

<h2>What is Nougat?</h2>

<p>Nougat is a type of confectionery made primarily from sugar or honey, roasted nuts (such as almonds, pistachios, or hazelnuts), and sometimes egg whites. It comes in two main varieties: white nougat and brown nougat. White nougat, also known as "nougat de Mont√©limar," is typically softer and lighter in color, while brown nougat, or "nougatine," is darker and often contains caramelized sugar.</p>

<p>The texture of nougat can range from soft and chewy to hard and crunchy, depending on the ingredients and preparation method. It is commonly used in candy bars, such as Milky Way, Snickers, and Toblerone, and is also enjoyed on its own as a sweet treat.</p>

<h2>Is Nougat Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>The gluten-free status of nougat depends on its ingredients and the manufacturing process. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. Since the primary ingredients in nougat are sugar, nuts, and egg whites, it would seem that nougat should naturally be gluten-free. However, there are several factors to consider:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Some nougat recipes may include additives or flavorings that contain gluten. For example, certain types of nougat may use wheat-based glucose syrup or malt flavoring, both of which contain gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> Even if the ingredients are gluten-free, there is a risk of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process. This can occur if the nougat is produced in a facility that also processes gluten-containing products.</li>
    <li><strong>Commercial Nougat:</strong> Commercially produced nougat, such as that found in candy bars, may contain additional ingredients that introduce gluten. It is essential to read the ingredient list and look for gluten-free certification on the packaging.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Identify Gluten-Free Nougat</h2>

<p>When shopping for nougat, it is crucial to read the ingredient list carefully. Look for any mention of wheat, barley, rye, or their derivatives. Additionally, check for gluten-free certification on the packaging. Some common gluten-free certifications include:</p>
