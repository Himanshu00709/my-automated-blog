    <h1>Is Miralax Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, ensuring that medications and supplements are gluten-free is crucial. Miralax, a popular over-the-counter laxative, is often recommended for relieving occasional constipation. But is Miralax gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients of Miralax, its safety for those avoiding gluten, and provide answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What is Miralax?</h2>

    <p>Miralax is a brand-name laxative that contains the active ingredient polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG 3350). It works by drawing water into the colon, softening the stool, and making it easier to pass. Miralax is commonly used to treat occasional constipation and is often recommended by healthcare providers due to its gentle and effective nature.</p>

    <h2>Is Miralax Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, Miralax is gluten-free. According to the manufacturer, Miralax does not contain gluten or any gluten-derived ingredients. This makes it a safe option for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it’s always a good idea to check the product label or consult with a healthcare provider if you have any concerns.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten in Medications</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, even trace amounts of gluten can trigger an immune response, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea. While gluten is more commonly associated with food, it can also be found in medications and supplements as a filler or binding agent.</p>

    <p>When it comes to medications, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require manufacturers to label products as gluten-free. However, many pharmaceutical companies voluntarily disclose gluten-free status on their product labels or websites. In the case of Miralax, the manufacturer has confirmed that the product is gluten-free.</p>
