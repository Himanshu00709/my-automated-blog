    <h1>Gluten-Free Soups: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Soup is a comforting and versatile dish that can be enjoyed year-round. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding gluten-free soups can be a challenge. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause adverse reactions in those who are intolerant. In this guide, we’ll explore what makes a soup gluten-free, provide a list of safe options, and offer tips for making your own gluten-free soups at home.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Soup Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>A soup is considered gluten-free if it does not contain any ingredients derived from wheat, barley, rye, or their derivatives. This includes common thickeners like flour or barley malt, as well as pasta or croutons that may be added to the soup. Many soups are naturally gluten-free, but it’s essential to read labels carefully or ask about ingredients when dining out.</p>

    <h2>Naturally Gluten-Free Soups</h2>
    <p>Many soups are naturally gluten-free, especially those made with whole, unprocessed ingredients. Here are some examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vegetable Soup:</strong> Made with a variety of vegetables, broth, and herbs, vegetable soup is typically gluten-free. Just ensure the broth used is gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken Noodle Soup:</strong> Traditional chicken noodle soup contains gluten due to the noodles. However, gluten-free versions use rice noodles or other gluten-free pasta alternatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato Soup:</strong> Classic tomato soup is usually gluten-free, but some canned versions may contain thickeners or additives that include gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Lentil Soup:</strong> Lentil soup is a hearty, gluten-free option that’s packed with protein and fiber.</li>
    </ul>
