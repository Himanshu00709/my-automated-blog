    <h1>Does Orange Juice Contain Gluten? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Orange juice is a popular beverage enjoyed by millions worldwide for its refreshing taste and health benefits. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, understanding whether orange juice contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we will explore the relationship between orange juice and gluten, providing you with a comprehensive guide to make informed dietary choices.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It acts as a binding agent, giving elasticity to dough and helping it rise. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and autoimmune reactions.</p>

    <h2>Is Orange Juice Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Orange juice, in its purest form, is naturally gluten-free. Oranges are fruits, and fruits do not contain gluten. When you squeeze fresh oranges to make juice, the resulting product is free from gluten. However, the situation becomes more complex when considering commercially produced orange juices, which may contain additives or be processed in facilities that handle gluten-containing products.</p>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Orange Juice</h2>

    <p>While pure orange juice is gluten-free, there are several factors to consider when purchasing commercial orange juice:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Factor</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Additives</td>
                <td>Some orange juices may contain additives like flavorings, colorings, or preservatives that could potentially contain gluten. Always check the ingredient list.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cross-Contamination</td>
                <td>If orange juice is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing products, there is a risk of cross-contamination. Look for labels that indicate the product is processed in a gluten-free facility.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Fortified Juices</td>
                <td>Some orange juices are fortified with vitamins and minerals. The fortification process may involve ingredients that contain gluten. Always verify the source of fortification.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
