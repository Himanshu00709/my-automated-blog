    <h1>Do Sesame Seeds Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Sesame seeds are a popular ingredient in many cuisines around the world, known for their nutty flavor and nutritional benefits. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding whether sesame seeds contain gluten is crucial. In this article, we will explore the relationship between sesame seeds and gluten, their nutritional profile, and how they fit into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Sesame Seeds?</h2>

    <p>Sesame seeds are tiny, oil-rich seeds that come from the sesame plant (<em>Sesamum indicum</em>). They are commonly used in baking, cooking, and as a garnish for various dishes. Sesame seeds are also a key ingredient in tahini, a paste used in Middle Eastern cuisine, and are often pressed to produce sesame oil. These seeds are packed with essential nutrients, including healthy fats, protein, fiber, and various vitamins and minerals.</p>

    <h2>Do Sesame Seeds Contain Gluten?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is responsible for the elasticity and chewiness of dough. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and autoimmune reactions.</p>

    <p>The good news is that sesame seeds are naturally gluten-free. They do not contain any gluten proteins, making them a safe option for those on a gluten-free diet. However, it's essential to consider the possibility of cross-contamination. Sesame seeds can sometimes be processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing grains, which could lead to trace amounts of gluten in the final product.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Profile of Sesame Seeds</h2>

    <p>Sesame seeds are not only gluten-free but also highly nutritious. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of their nutritional content per 100 grams:</p>
