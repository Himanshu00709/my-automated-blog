    <h1>Are Garbanzo Beans Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Garbanzo beans, also known as chickpeas, are a staple in many diets around the world. They are versatile, nutritious, and can be used in a variety of dishes, from hummus to salads and stews. But for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether garbanzo beans are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of garbanzo beans, their nutritional benefits, and how to safely incorporate them into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Garbanzo Beans?</h2>

    <p>Garbanzo beans, or chickpeas, are a type of legume that belong to the Fabaceae family.

Since garbanzo beans are a legume and not a grain, they do not contain gluten. This makes them a safe and nutritious option for individuals who need to avoid gluten due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or other health reasons.</p>
