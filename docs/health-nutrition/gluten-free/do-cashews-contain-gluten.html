    <h1>Do Cashews Contain Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Cashews are a popular nut enjoyed by many for their creamy texture and rich flavor. They are often used in cooking, baking, and as a snack. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding whether cashews contain gluten is crucial. In this article, we will explore the relationship between cashews and gluten, providing you with all the information you need to make informed dietary choices.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It acts as a binding agent, giving dough its elasticity and helping it rise. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine.</p>

    <h2>Are Cashews Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, cashews are naturally gluten-free. They are a type of tree nut and do not contain any gluten proteins. This makes them a safe option for individuals who need to avoid gluten in their diet. However, it's important to note that while cashews themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during processing, packaging, or preparation.</p>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten Contamination in Cashews</h2>

    <p>Even though cashews are naturally gluten-free, there are several ways they can become contaminated with gluten:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Processing Facilities:</strong> Cashews processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products may be at risk of cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavored Cashews:</strong> Some flavored cashews may contain gluten-containing ingredients or be processed on shared equipment.</li>
        <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> Improperly sealed packaging can lead to contamination during transportation or storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Ensure Your Cashews Are Gluten-Free</h2>
