<h1>Are Saltines Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Saltines, also known as soda crackers, are a popular snack and pantry staple for many households. They are often enjoyed on their own, with soups, or as a base for various appetizers. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether saltines are gluten-free is of utmost importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of saltines, explore gluten-free alternatives, and provide answers to frequently asked questions about gluten-free diets.</p>

<h2>What Are Saltines Made Of?</h2>

<p>Saltines are typically made from a simple combination of ingredients, including wheat flour, yeast, baking soda, and salt. The wheat flour used in traditional saltines contains gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Gluten is responsible for the elastic texture of dough and is a key component in many baked goods. However, for those who need to avoid gluten, this poses a problem.</p>

<p>Here is a breakdown of the common ingredients found in traditional saltines:</p>

        <tr>
            <td>Salt</td>
            <td>No</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
