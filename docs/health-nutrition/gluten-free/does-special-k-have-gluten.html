    <h1>Does Special K Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Special K is one of the most popular cereal brands worldwide, known for its light, crispy texture and variety of flavors. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance, celiac disease, or those following a gluten-free diet, the question of whether Special K contains gluten is crucial.
