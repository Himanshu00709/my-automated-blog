    <h1>Is Unleavened Bread Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Unleavened bread has been a staple in many cultures for centuries, often associated with religious traditions and dietary practices. But for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Is unleavened bread gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we will explore the nature of unleavened bread, its ingredients, and whether it can be safely consumed by those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Unleavened Bread?</h2>

    <p>Unleavened bread is a type of bread that is made without the use of leavening agents, such as yeast or baking powder. This results in a flat, dense bread that is often used in religious ceremonies, such as Passover in Judaism or Communion in Christianity. The most common types of unleavened bread include matzo, tortillas, and certain types of flatbreads.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Unleavened Bread</h2>

    <p>The primary ingredients in unleavened bread are flour and water. However, the type of flour used can vary, and this is where the gluten content comes into play. Traditional unleavened bread is made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, there are gluten-free alternatives available that use flours made from rice, corn, or other gluten-free grains.</p>
