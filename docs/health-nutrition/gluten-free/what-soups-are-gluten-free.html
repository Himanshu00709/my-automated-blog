<h1>Gluten-Free Soups: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply choosing to avoid gluten, finding safe and delicious food options can be a challenge. Soups, a staple in many diets, often contain hidden sources of gluten. However, with the right knowledge and ingredients, you can enjoy a wide variety of gluten-free soups that are both nutritious and satisfying. This guide will explore what makes a soup gluten-free, provide examples of gluten-free soups, and offer tips for preparing them at home.</p>

<h2>What Makes a Soup Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For a soup to be gluten-free, it must not contain any of these ingredients. This includes avoiding thickeners like flour, barley, and certain types of pasta. Instead, gluten-free soups rely on alternative ingredients such as cornstarch, rice flour, or gluten-free grains like quinoa and rice. Additionally, it's crucial to ensure that all broth, spices, and additives used in the soup are certified gluten-free, as cross-contamination can occur during processing.</p>

<h2>Popular Gluten-Free Soup Options</h2>
