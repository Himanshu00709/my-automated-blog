    <h1>Are Cashew Nuts Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Cashew nuts are a popular snack and ingredient in many cuisines around the world. They are known for their creamy texture and rich flavor, making them a favorite in both sweet and savory dishes. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether cashew nuts are gluten-free is of utmost importance. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of cashew nuts, potential sources of gluten contamination, and how to safely incorporate them into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Cashew Nuts?</h2>

    <p>Cashew nuts are the seeds of the cashew apple, which grows on the cashew tree (Anacardium occidentale). Native to Brazil, cashew trees are now cultivated in various tropical regions around the world, including India, Vietnam, and Africa. The nuts are encased in a hard shell that contains a toxic resin, which must be carefully removed during processing. Once processed, cashew nuts are safe to eat and are enjoyed in a variety of forms, including raw, roasted, salted, and as an ingredient in recipes.</p>

    <h2>Are Cashew Nuts Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, cashew nuts are naturally gluten-free. Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. Since cashew nuts are not grains and do not belong to the grass family, they do not contain gluten. This makes them a safe option for individuals who need to avoid gluten due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or other health reasons.</p>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten Contamination</h2>

    <p>While cashew nuts themselves are gluten-free, there are potential sources of gluten contamination that you should be aware of:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination During Processing:</strong> Cashew nuts may be processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products. This can lead to cross-contamination if proper cleaning protocols are not followed.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavored or Seasoned Cashews:</strong> Some flavored or seasoned cashew products may contain gluten-containing ingredients, such as wheat-based soy sauce or malt vinegar.</li>
        <li><strong>Packaging and Storage:</strong> Cashew nuts may be stored or packaged in containers that previously held gluten-containing products, leading to contamination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Ensure Your Cashews Are Gluten-Free</h2>

    <p>To ensure that the cashew nuts you consume are gluten-free, consider the following tips:</p>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Avoid Bulk Bins</td>
                <td>Bulk bins in grocery stores are a common source of cross-contamination. Opt for pre-packaged cashew nuts instead.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Contact the Manufacturer</td>
