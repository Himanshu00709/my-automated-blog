    <h1>Are Molasses Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Molasses, a thick, dark syrup derived from the processing of sugar cane or sugar beets, has been a staple in kitchens for centuries. Its rich, robust flavor makes it a popular ingredient in baking, cooking, and even as a sweetener in beverages. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether molasses is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will delve into the details of molasses, its production process, and whether it is safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Molasses?</h2>

    <p>Molasses is a byproduct of the sugar-making process. When sugar cane or sugar beets are crushed to extract their juice, the juice is then boiled to concentrate it, resulting in the crystallization of sugar. The thick, dark syrup that remains after the sugar crystals have been removed is molasses. There are different types of molasses, including light, dark, and blackstrap, each with varying levels of sweetness and nutritional content.</p>

    <h2>Is Molasses Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>In its pure form, molasses is naturally gluten-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale, and since molasses is derived from sugar cane or sugar beets, it does not contain gluten. However, the gluten-free status of molasses can be compromised during processing or packaging if cross-contamination occurs. For example, if molasses is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing products, there is a risk of gluten contamination.</p>

            <tr>
                <th>Type of Molasses</th>
