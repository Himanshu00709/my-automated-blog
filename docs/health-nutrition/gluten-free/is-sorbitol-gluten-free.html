    <h1>Is Sorbitol Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, gluten-free diets have gained significant attention, especially among individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. For those who must avoid gluten, understanding the gluten content of various food additives and ingredients is crucial. One such ingredient that often raises questions is sorbitol. In this article, we will explore whether sorbitol is gluten-free, its uses, and its implications for those on a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Sorbitol?</h2>

    <p>Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol commonly used as a sweetener in a variety of food products. It is naturally found in fruits like apples, pears, and peaches, but it is also produced industrially from glucose. Sorbitol is known for its low-calorie content and its ability to provide sweetness without causing a rapid spike in blood sugar levels, making it a popular choice for sugar-free and diabetic-friendly products.</p>

    <p>In addition to its use as a sweetener, sorbitol is also used as a humectant, which helps retain moisture in products, and as a texturizer, which improves the texture of foods. It is commonly found in sugar-free gum, candies, baked goods, and even some pharmaceutical products like cough syrups and toothpaste.</p>

    <h2>Is Sorbitol Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The short answer is yes, sorbitol is gluten-free. Sorbitol itself is a simple carbohydrate and does not contain gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. However, the gluten-free status of sorbitol can be influenced by how it is processed and the other ingredients it is combined with in food products.</p>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it is essential to ensure that the sorbitol used in a product is not contaminated with gluten during manufacturing. Cross-contamination can occur if sorbitol is processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing ingredients. Therefore, it is crucial to look for products that are certified gluten-free by reputable organizations.</p>

    <h2>Uses of Sorbitol in Gluten-Free Products</h2>

    <p>Sorbitol is widely used in gluten-free products due to its versatility and beneficial properties. Here are some common uses of sorbitol in gluten-free foods:</p>
