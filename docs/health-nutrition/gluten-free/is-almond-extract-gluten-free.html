    <h1>Is Almond Extract Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Almond extract is a popular ingredient in baking and cooking, known for its rich, nutty flavor. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, determining whether almond extract is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of almond extract, its ingredients, potential cross-contamination risks, and how to choose a safe product.</p>

    <h2>What is Almond Extract?</h2>

    <p>Almond extract is a concentrated liquid made from bitter almond oil, alcohol, and water. It is commonly used to enhance the flavor of baked goods, desserts, and beverages.

    <h3>Ingredients to Watch Out For</h3>
