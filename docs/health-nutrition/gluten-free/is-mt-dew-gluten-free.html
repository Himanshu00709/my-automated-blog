    <h1>Is Mountain Dew Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Mountain Dew is one of the most popular soft drinks in the world, known for its bold citrus flavor and high caffeine content. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, the question of whether Mountain Dew is gluten-free is of paramount importance. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of Mountain Dew, explore its gluten-free status, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the lining of the small intestine, leading to a host of health issues. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. Therefore, it's crucial for these individuals to avoid gluten-containing products.</p>

    <h2>Mountain Dew Ingredients Breakdown</h2>
    <p>To determine whether Mountain Dew is gluten-free, we need to examine its ingredients. The standard Mountain Dew ingredients include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Carbonated water</li>
        <li>High fructose corn syrup</li>
        <li>Concentrated orange juice</li>
        <li>Citric acid</li>
        <li>Natural flavors</li>
        <li>Sodium benzoate (preservative)</li>
        <li>Caffeine</li>
        <li>Sodium citrate</li>
        <li>Erythorbic acid (preservative)</li>
        <li>Gum arabic</li>
        <li>Calcium disodium EDTA (to protect flavor)</li>
        <li>Brominated vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Yellow 5</li>
    </ul>
    <p>None of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it's important to note that "natural flavors" can sometimes be a source of hidden gluten, depending on their source. In the case of Mountain Dew, the natural flavors used are derived from non-gluten sources, making the drink safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Is Mountain Dew Certified Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>While Mountain Dew does not carry an official gluten-free certification, the manufacturer, PepsiCo, has stated that Mountain Dew is gluten-free. According to PepsiCo's website, Mountain Dew does not contain any gluten ingredients and is considered safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it's always a good idea to check the label or contact the manufacturer if you have any concerns.</p>

    <h2>Comparing Mountain Dew Variants</h2>
    <p>Mountain Dew comes in several variants, including Diet Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew Zero Sugar, and various flavored versions like Code Red and Voltage. Let's take a closer look at whether these variants are also gluten-free:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Mountain Dew Variant</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Diet Mountain Dew</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mountain Dew Zero Sugar</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mountain Dew Code Red</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mountain Dew Voltage</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mountain Dew Baja Blast</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>As you can see, all the major Mountain Dew variants are gluten-free. However, it's always a good practice to read the label or check with the manufacturer if you're trying a new variant or flavor.</p>

    <h2>Potential Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>
    <p>While Mountain Dew and its variants are gluten-free, there is always a risk of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process. Cross-contamination can occur if gluten-containing products are processed on the same equipment as gluten-free products. However, PepsiCo has stringent manufacturing practices in place to minimize this risk. If you have severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, you may want to contact PepsiCo directly to inquire about their cross-contamination protocols.</p>
