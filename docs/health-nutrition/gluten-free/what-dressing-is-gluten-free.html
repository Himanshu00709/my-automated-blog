<h1>What Dressings Are Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply choosing to avoid gluten, navigating the world of food products can be challenging. Salad dressings, in particular, can be a hidden source of gluten due to additives, thickeners, or flavorings. This guide will help you understand which dressings are gluten-free, what to look for on labels, and how to make your own gluten-free dressings at home.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten in Dressings</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is often used as a thickening agent or stabilizer in processed foods, including salad dressings. Common ingredients that may contain gluten include malt vinegar, soy sauce, and certain flavorings. Even dressings labeled as "natural" or "healthy" can sometimes contain gluten, so it's essential to read labels carefully.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Dressing Options</h2>

<p>Fortunately, many dressings are naturally gluten-free or are specifically formulated to be gluten-free. Below is a table of common dressing types and their gluten-free status:</p>
