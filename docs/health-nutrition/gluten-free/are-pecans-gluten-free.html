    <h1>Are Pecans Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Pecans are a popular nut known for their rich, buttery flavor and numerous health benefits. They are often used in baking, cooking, and as a snack. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, it's crucial to know whether pecans are safe to consume. In this article, we will explore whether pecans are gluten-free, their nutritional benefits, and how to incorporate them into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Does Gluten-Free Mean?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. A gluten-free diet eliminates all sources of gluten, which means avoiding foods that contain these grains or any cross-contamination with them.</p>

    <h2>Are Pecans Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, pecans are naturally gluten-free. They are a type of tree nut, and like other nuts, they do not contain gluten. This makes them a safe and healthy option for individuals who need to avoid gluten. However, it's important to be cautious about how pecans are processed and packaged, as cross-contamination can occur if they are processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Pecans</h2>

    <p>Pecans are not only gluten-free but also packed with essential nutrients. Here are some of the key nutritional benefits of pecans:</p>
