    <h1>Gluten-Free Nuts: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply choosing a gluten-free lifestyle, understanding which foods are safe to consume is crucial. Nuts are a popular snack and ingredient in many dishes, but are they gluten-free? The short answer is yes, most nuts are naturally gluten-free. However, there are important considerations to keep in mind to ensure that the nuts you consume are free from gluten contamination. In this article, we’ll explore which nuts are gluten-free, how to avoid cross-contamination, and provide answers to frequently asked questions about nuts and gluten.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Nuts Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Nuts are naturally gluten-free because they are seeds or fruits that grow on trees. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives, which are not present in nuts. However, the way nuts are processed, packaged, or flavored can introduce gluten into the product. For example, nuts that are roasted or seasoned with certain flavorings may contain gluten if the flavorings include gluten-containing ingredients. Therefore, it’s essential to read labels carefully and choose nuts that are certified gluten-free when necessary.</p>

    <h2>List of Gluten-Free Nuts</h2>

    <h2>How to Avoid Gluten Contamination in Nuts</h2>
    <p>While nuts themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during processing, packaging, or even in the kitchen. Here are some tips to ensure your nuts remain gluten-free:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose Certified Gluten-Free Nuts:</strong> Look for nuts that are labeled as certified gluten-free. This certification ensures that the product has been tested and meets strict gluten-free standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Read Labels Carefully:</strong> Always check the ingredient list and allergen statement on packaged nuts. Avoid products that list wheat, barley, rye, or any gluten-containing additives.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Bulk Bins:</strong> Nuts sold in bulk bins are at a higher risk of cross-contamination due to shared scoops and bins. Opt for pre-packaged nuts instead.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Shared Facilities:</strong> Some nuts are processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products. Look for statements on the packaging that indicate whether the product was made in a shared facility.</li>
    </ul>
