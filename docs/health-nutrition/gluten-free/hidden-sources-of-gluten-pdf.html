    <h1>Hidden Sources of Gluten: What You Need to Know</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, avoiding gluten is not just a dietary choice—it’s a necessity. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe health issues for those who are intolerant. While many people are aware of obvious sources of gluten, such as bread and pasta, there are numerous hidden sources that can catch even the most vigilant gluten-free dieters off guard. This article will explore these hidden sources, provide tips for identifying them, and offer guidance on maintaining a truly gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins that give elasticity to dough, helping it rise and maintain its shape. For most people, gluten is harmless. However, for those with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to malabsorption of nutrients and a host of other health problems. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity can also cause symptoms like bloating, fatigue, and joint pain, even without intestinal damage.</p>
    <p>Given the serious consequences of gluten ingestion for sensitive individuals, it’s crucial to be aware of all potential sources of gluten, including those that are not immediately obvious.</p>

    <h2>Common Hidden Sources of Gluten</h2>
    <p>While gluten is most commonly found in wheat-based products, it can also lurk in unexpected places. Below is a table outlining some common hidden sources of gluten:</p>

    <h2>How to Identify Hidden Gluten</h2>
    <p>Identifying hidden gluten requires diligence and a keen eye for detail. Here are some strategies to help you avoid accidental gluten ingestion:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Read Labels Carefully:</strong> Look for terms like "wheat," "barley," "rye," and "malt" on ingredient lists. Be aware that gluten can also be listed under less obvious names, such as "modified food starch" or "hydrolyzed vegetable protein."</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Certified Gluten-Free Products:</strong> Products labeled "gluten-free" are required to meet strict standards, making them a safer choice.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Cautious with Cross-Contamination:</strong> Even if a product is inherently gluten-free, it can become contaminated during processing or preparation. Look for products that are processed in dedicated gluten-free facilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask Questions When Dining Out:</strong> When eating at restaurants, don’t hesitate to ask about ingredients and preparation methods to ensure your meal is gluten-free.</li>
    </ul>
