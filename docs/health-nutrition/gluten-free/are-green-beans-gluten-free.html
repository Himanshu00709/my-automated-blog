    <h1>Are Green Beans Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Green beans, also known as string beans or snap beans, are a popular vegetable enjoyed by many for their crisp texture and nutritional benefits. But for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether green beans are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of green beans, their nutritional profile, and how to safely incorporate them into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Green Beans?</h2>

    <p>Green beans are the unripe, young fruit of various cultivars of the common bean (<em>Phaseolus vulgaris</em>). They are harvested before the seeds inside the pods have fully matured, giving them their characteristic tender texture. Green beans can be eaten raw, steamed, boiled, or sautéed, and are a staple in many cuisines around the world.</p>

    <h2>Are Green Beans Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, green beans are naturally gluten-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. Since green beans are a vegetable and not a grain, they do not contain gluten. This makes them a safe and healthy option for individuals who need to avoid gluten due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or other health reasons.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Green Beans</h2>

    <p>Green beans are not only gluten-free but also packed with essential nutrients. Here’s a breakdown of their nutritional profile:</p>
