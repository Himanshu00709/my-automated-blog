    <h1>Is Sprite Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating the world of food and beverages can be a daunting task. One common question that arises is whether popular soft drinks like Sprite are gluten-free. In this article, we will delve into the ingredients of Sprite, explore its gluten-free status, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to a range of symptoms and long-term health complications. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, avoiding gluten is essential to prevent discomfort and adverse reactions.</p>

    <p>Given the prevalence of gluten in many foods and beverages, it's crucial to scrutinize product labels and understand the ingredients used. This is especially true for soft drinks, which may contain additives or flavorings derived from gluten-containing grains.</p>

    <h2>What is Sprite Made Of?</h2>

    <p>Sprite is a lemon-lime flavored soft drink produced by The Coca-Cola Company. It is known for its crisp, refreshing taste and is a popular choice among consumers. To determine whether Sprite is gluten-free, let's take a closer look at its ingredients:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Carbonated Water</td>
                <td>Water that has been infused with carbon dioxide gas under pressure, giving it its fizz.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>High Fructose Corn Syrup</td>
                <td>A sweetener made from corn starch, commonly used in soft drinks.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Citric Acid</td>
                <td>A natural preservative and flavoring agent that adds tartness.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Natural Flavors</td>
                <td>Flavorings derived from natural sources, which may include fruits, herbs, or spices.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sodium Citrate</td>
                <td>A salt of citric acid used as a flavor enhancer and preservative.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sodium Benzoate</td>
                <td>A preservative that prevents the growth of bacteria, yeast, and fungi.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As we can see, the ingredients in Sprite are relatively simple and do not include any obvious sources of gluten. However, it's important to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process or the use of gluten-derived additives in the natural flavors.</p>

    <h2>Is Sprite Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Based on the ingredient list and information provided by The Coca-Cola Company, Sprite is considered gluten-free. The company states that Sprite does not contain any gluten-containing ingredients and is safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity to consume.</p>

    <p>However, it's worth noting that while Sprite itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during production if the same equipment is used to process gluten-containing products. The Coca-Cola Company has stringent quality control measures in place to minimize this risk, but it's always a good idea to check the label or contact the manufacturer if you have any concerns.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification and Labeling</h2>

    <p>In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates gluten-free labeling. For a product to be labeled as gluten-free, it must contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. This threshold is considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

    <p>Sprite does not carry a gluten-free certification label, but it meets the FDA's criteria for gluten-free products. The absence of a certification label does not necessarily indicate the presence of gluten; it simply means that the product has not undergone third-party testing to verify its gluten-free status.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Sprite and Gluten</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can people with celiac disease drink Sprite?</h3>
        <p>Yes, people with celiac disease can safely drink Sprite as it does not contain gluten-containing ingredients and meets the FDA's criteria for gluten-free products.</p>

        <h3>2. Does Sprite contain any hidden sources of gluten?</h3>
        <p>No, Sprite does not contain any hidden sources of gluten. The ingredients listed on the label are free from gluten, and The Coca-Cola Company has confirmed its gluten-free status.</p>

        <h3>3. Is there a risk of cross-contamination with gluten in Sprite?</h3>
        <p>While the risk of cross-contamination is low, it cannot be entirely ruled out. The Coca-Cola Company has strict quality control measures to minimize this risk, but individuals with severe gluten sensitivity should exercise caution.</p>

        <h3>4. Are other Coca-Cola products gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Many Coca-Cola products, including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, and Fanta, are also considered gluten-free. However, it's always best to check the label or contact the manufacturer for confirmation.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>In conclusion, Sprite is a gluten-free beverage that is safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity to consume. Its simple ingredient list and adherence to FDA guidelines make it a reliable choice for those avoiding gluten. While the absence of a gluten-free certification label may raise questions for some, the information provided by The Coca-Cola Company and the ingredient analysis confirm its gluten-free status.</p>
