    <h1>Is Orange Juice Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Orange juice is a staple in many households, enjoyed for its refreshing taste and nutritional benefits. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether orange juice is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of orange juice, potential sources of gluten contamination, and tips for ensuring your orange juice is safe to consume.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is responsible for the elastic texture of dough and is commonly found in bread, pasta, and baked goods. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and long-term health complications.</p>

    <h2>Is Orange Juice Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Pure, 100% orange juice is naturally gluten-free. Oranges, like all fruits, do not contain gluten. When oranges are juiced without any additives or preservatives, the resulting juice is free from gluten. However, the gluten-free status of orange juice can be compromised during processing, packaging, or through the addition of certain ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten Contamination in Orange Juice</h2>

    <p>While orange juice itself is gluten-free, there are several ways in which gluten contamination can occur:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Source</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Additives and Preservatives</td>
                <td>Some orange juice brands may add flavorings, colorings, or preservatives that contain gluten. Always check the ingredient list for any gluten-containing additives.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cross-Contamination</td>
                <td>If orange juice is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing products, there is a risk of cross-contamination. Look for labels that indicate the product is processed in a gluten-free facility.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Packaging</td>
                <td>In rare cases, the packaging materials used for orange juice may contain gluten. This is more common in products that use flavored or fortified packaging.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>How to Ensure Your Orange Juice is Gluten-Free</h2>

    </ul>
