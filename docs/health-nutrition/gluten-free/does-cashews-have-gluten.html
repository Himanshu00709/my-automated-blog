    <h1>Do Cashews Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Cashews are a popular nut known for their creamy texture and rich flavor. They are often used in a variety of dishes, from snacks to desserts, and are a staple in many diets. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding whether cashews contain gluten is crucial. In this article, we will explore whether cashews have gluten, how they fit into a gluten-free diet, and what to look out for when purchasing cashew products.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It acts as a binding agent, giving dough its elasticity and helping it rise. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine.</p>

    <h2>Are Cashews Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, cashews are naturally gluten-free. They are a type of tree nut and do not contain any gluten proteins. This makes them a safe option for individuals who need to avoid gluten in their diet. However, it's important to note that while cashews themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during processing, packaging, or preparation. This is especially true if cashews are processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products.</p>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Cashew Products</h2>

    <p>While cashews are naturally gluten-free, certain cashew products may contain gluten due to added ingredients or cross-contamination. Here are some common sources of gluten in cashew products:</p>

            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Flavored Cashews</td>

                <td>Thickeners or stabilizers that contain gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cashew-Based Snacks</td>
