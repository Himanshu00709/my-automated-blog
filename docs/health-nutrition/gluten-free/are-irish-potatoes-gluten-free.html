    <h1>Are Irish Potatoes Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Irish potatoes, also known as white potatoes, are a staple in many diets around the world. They are versatile, nutritious, and can be prepared in countless ways. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, understanding whether Irish potatoes are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of Irish potatoes, their nutritional benefits, and how to safely incorporate them into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Irish Potatoes?</h2>

    <p>Irish potatoes, scientifically known as <em>Solanum tuberosum</em>, are a type of tuber that originated in South America but became widely popular in Ireland during the 16th century.

Irish potatoes are naturally gluten-free, which means they do not contain the proteins found in wheat, barley, or rye that can trigger adverse reactions in people with gluten-related disorders.</p>
