    <h1>Is Senokot Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Senokot is a widely used over-the-counter laxative that helps relieve constipation. It contains senna, a natural plant-based ingredient known for its laxative properties. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it's crucial to know whether Senokot is gluten-free. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free status of Senokot, its ingredients, and what you need to know if you’re following a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Senokot?</h2>

    <p>Senokot is a brand of laxative that uses senna as its active ingredient. Senna is derived from the leaves and fruit of the senna plant, which has been used for centuries as a natural remedy for constipation. Senokot is available in various forms, including tablets, granules, and liquid, making it a versatile option for those seeking relief from constipation.</p>

    <p>Senokot works by stimulating the muscles in the intestines, promoting bowel movements. It’s generally considered safe for short-term use, but like any medication, it’s important to use it as directed and consult with a healthcare provider if you have any underlying health conditions.</p>

However, it’s always a good idea to check the product packaging or consult with a healthcare provider to ensure that the specific formulation you’re using is free from gluten.
