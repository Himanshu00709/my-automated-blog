    <h1>Gluten-Free Living: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the gluten-free diet has gained significant attention, not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle. Whether you're new to gluten-free living or looking to refine your knowledge, this brochure serves as your ultimate guide to understanding, adopting, and thriving on a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. It acts as a binding agent, giving dough its elasticity and helping it rise. While gluten is harmless for most people, it can cause serious health issues for those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergy.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Adopting a gluten-free diet is essential for individuals with celiac disease, as consuming gluten can damage the small intestine and lead to severe health complications. Additionally, some people experience non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which can cause symptoms like bloating, fatigue, and headaches. For others, a gluten-free diet may simply be a personal choice to improve overall well-being.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of a Gluten-Free Diet</h2>
    <p>While the primary benefit of a gluten-free diet is the management of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity, there are other potential advantages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Digestive Health:</strong> Eliminating gluten can reduce bloating, gas, and diarrhea for those with gluten-related disorders.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Energy Levels:</strong> Many people report feeling more energetic after cutting out gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Nutrient Absorption:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease, a gluten-free diet allows the intestines to heal, improving nutrient absorption.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Foods: What to Eat and Avoid</h2>
    <p>Navigating a gluten-free diet can be challenging, but understanding which foods are safe and which to avoid is crucial. Below is a table summarizing gluten-free and gluten-containing foods:</p>
