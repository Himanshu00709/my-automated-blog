    <h1>Is Soy Lecithin Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, understanding which ingredients are safe to consume is crucial. One such ingredient that often raises questions is soy lecithin. In this article, we will explore whether soy lecithin is gluten-free, its uses, and what you need to know to make informed dietary choices.</p>

    <h2>What is Soy Lecithin?</h2>
