    <h1>Is Salmon Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Salmon is one of the most popular and nutritious fish available, known for its rich flavor and high omega-3 fatty acid content. But for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether salmon is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free status of salmon, how it can be prepared safely, and what to watch out for when purchasing or consuming it.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Does It Matter?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives.

Therefore, understanding which foods are naturally gluten-free and which may contain hidden gluten is essential for maintaining a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Is Salmon Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, salmon is naturally gluten-free. Fresh, unprocessed salmon contains no gluten, making it a safe choice for those avoiding gluten. However, the way salmon is prepared, cooked, or processed can introduce gluten into the dish. For example, breaded or marinated salmon may contain gluten-containing ingredients. It’s important to read labels carefully and ask questions when dining out to ensure the salmon remains gluten-free.</p>

        <li><strong>Avoid Cross-Contamination:</strong> When cooking at home, use clean utensils and cookware to avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing foods.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask Questions When Dining Out:</strong> When ordering salmon at a restaurant, ask about the preparation methods and whether gluten-free options are available.</li>
