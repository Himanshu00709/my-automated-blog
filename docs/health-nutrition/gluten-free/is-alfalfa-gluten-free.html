    <h1>Is Alfalfa Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Alfalfa, a nutrient-dense plant often used in salads, smoothies, and supplements, has gained popularity among health-conscious individuals. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Is alfalfa gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free status of alfalfa, its nutritional benefits, and how it fits into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Alfalfa?</h2>

    <p>Alfalfa (<em>Medicago sativa</em>) is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the legume family. It has been cultivated for centuries as a forage crop for livestock, but its nutrient-rich leaves and sprouts have also found their way into human diets. Alfalfa is packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, making it a popular choice for those seeking to boost their overall health.</p>
