    <p>In recent years, gluten-free diets have gained immense popularity, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also among health-conscious individuals. But what exactly is gluten-free food, and why is it important? This blog post will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free food, its benefits, and how to incorporate it into your lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in grains like wheat, barley, and rye. It acts as a binding agent, giving dough its elasticity and helping it rise. While gluten is harmless for most people, it can cause serious health issues for those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergy.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Food?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free food refers to any food product that does not contain gluten. This includes naturally gluten-free foods like fruits, vegetables, meat, and dairy, as well as processed foods that have been specifically formulated to exclude gluten-containing ingredients.</p>
