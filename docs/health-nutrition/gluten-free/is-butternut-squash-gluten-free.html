    <h1>Is Butternut Squash Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Butternut squash is a versatile and nutritious vegetable that has become a staple in many kitchens.

This makes it a safe and healthy option for those who need to avoid gluten in their diet. However, it's important to consider how butternut squash is prepared and served, as cross-contamination or added ingredients could introduce gluten.</p>
