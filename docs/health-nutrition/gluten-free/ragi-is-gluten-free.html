    <h1>Ragi: The Gluten-Free Superfood You Need to Know About</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free foods has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the general pursuit of healthier eating habits. Among the many gluten-free grains available, ragi, also known as finger millet, stands out as a nutritional powerhouse. This ancient grain, native to Africa and Asia, has been a staple in traditional diets for centuries. But what makes ragi truly special is its gluten-free nature, coupled with its impressive nutritional profile. In this article, we’ll explore why ragi is a must-have in your gluten-free diet, its health benefits, and how you can incorporate it into your meals.</p>

    <h2>What is Ragi?</h2>

    <p>Ragi, scientifically known as <em>Eleusine coracana</em>, is a type of millet that is widely cultivated in India, Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a hardy crop that can grow in arid conditions, making it an important food source in regions with challenging climates. Ragi is small in size, with a reddish-brown color, and is often ground into flour for use in various culinary applications. Unlike wheat, barley, and rye, ragi is naturally gluten-free, making it an excellent alternative for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Why Ragi is Gluten-Free</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in certain grains, such as wheat, barley, and rye. It is responsible for the elastic texture of dough and is commonly found in bread, pasta, and baked goods. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and autoimmune reactions. Ragi, being a millet, does not contain gluten, making it a safe and nutritious option for those who need to follow a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <p>Moreover, ragi is not only gluten-free but also rich in essential nutrients, making it a superior choice compared to many other gluten-free grains. Its nutritional profile includes high levels of calcium, iron, fiber, and amino acids, which are often lacking in gluten-free diets. This makes ragi an ideal grain for maintaining overall health while adhering to a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Ragi</h2>

    <p>Ragi is often referred to as a "superfood" due to its impressive nutritional content. Here’s a breakdown of the key nutrients found in ragi and their health benefits:</p>
