    <h1>Do Mushrooms Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Mushrooms are a versatile and nutritious food that has been enjoyed by humans for centuries. They are low in calories, rich in vitamins, and packed with antioxidants.

This makes them a safe and healthy option for individuals who need to avoid gluten in their diet. Whether you are eating button mushrooms, shiitake, portobello, or any other variety, you can rest assured that they are free from gluten.</p>
