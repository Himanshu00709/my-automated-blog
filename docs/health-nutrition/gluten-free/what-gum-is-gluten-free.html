    <h1>What Gum is Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding gluten-free products is essential to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. While many people focus on gluten-free foods, beverages, and snacks, one often overlooked product is chewing gum. Surprisingly, not all chewing gums are gluten-free, and consuming gluten-containing gum can lead to adverse health effects for those with gluten-related disorders. In this article, weâ€™ll explore what gum is gluten-free, why it matters, and how to identify safe options.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Gum Matters</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease, even trace amounts of gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine. Gluten sensitivity can also cause symptoms like bloating, headaches, and fatigue. While chewing gum may seem like a minor product, it can contain hidden gluten in its ingredients or manufacturing process. Therefore, choosing gluten-free gum is crucial for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Common Ingredients in Gum That May Contain Gluten</h2>
    <p>Chewing gum typically contains a base, sweeteners, flavorings, and softeners. While most gum bases are synthetic and gluten-free, some ingredients may pose a risk. Here are some common ingredients to watch out for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flavorings:</strong> Natural and artificial flavorings can sometimes contain gluten, especially if derived from barley or wheat.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweeteners:</strong> While most sweeteners like xylitol and sorbitol are gluten-free, maltitol (derived from barley) is not.</li>
        <li><strong>Dusting Agents:</strong> Some gums use wheat starch or flour as a dusting agent to prevent sticking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Popular Gluten-Free Gum Brands</h2>
