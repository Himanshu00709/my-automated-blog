    <h1>Does Salad Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Salads are often considered a healthy and safe option for those following a gluten-free diet. However, the question "Does salad have gluten?" is more complex than it seems. While the base ingredients of a salad—like lettuce, vegetables, and fruits—are naturally gluten-free, the toppings, dressings, and preparation methods can introduce gluten into the dish. In this article, we'll explore the factors that determine whether a salad contains gluten, how to identify gluten-free options, and tips for enjoying a safe and delicious salad.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It acts as a binding agent, giving elasticity to dough and helping it rise. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine.</p>
    <p>While gluten is commonly associated with bread, pasta, and baked goods, it can also be found in less obvious sources, such as sauces, dressings, and processed foods. This is why it's essential to scrutinize every component of a salad, even if the main ingredients seem harmless.</p>

    <h2>Common Gluten-Containing Salad Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Below is a table outlining common salad ingredients that may contain gluten:</p>
