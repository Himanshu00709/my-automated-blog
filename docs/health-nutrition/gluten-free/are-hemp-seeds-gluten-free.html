    <h1>Are Hemp Seeds Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, hemp seeds have gained popularity as a superfood, praised for their nutritional benefits and versatility in the kitchen. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether hemp seeds are gluten-free is of paramount importance. This article delves into the gluten-free nature of hemp seeds, their nutritional profile, and how they can be safely incorporated into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Hemp Seeds?</h2>

    <p>Hemp seeds, also known as hemp hearts, are the seeds of the hemp plant, <em>Cannabis sativa</em>. Unlike other parts of the plant, hemp seeds contain negligible amounts of THC, the psychoactive compound found in marijuana. Instead, they are packed with essential nutrients, including protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. Hemp seeds are often consumed raw, toasted, or as an ingredient in various dishes, such as smoothies, salads, and baked goods.</p>

    <h2>Are Hemp Seeds Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, hemp seeds are naturally gluten-free. Gluten is a group of proteins found in certain grains, such as wheat, barley, and rye. Since hemp seeds are not grains but rather seeds, they do not contain gluten. This makes them a safe and nutritious option for individuals who need to avoid gluten due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal dietary preferences.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Hemp Seeds</h2>

    <p>Hemp seeds are a nutritional powerhouse, offering a wide range of health benefits. Here’s a breakdown of their key nutrients:</p>
