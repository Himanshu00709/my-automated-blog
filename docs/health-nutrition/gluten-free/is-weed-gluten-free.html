    <h1>Is Weed Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>As the legalization of cannabis continues to spread across the globe, more people are exploring its potential benefits and uses. For individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, understanding whether cannabis products are gluten-free is crucial. This article delves into the relationship between weed and gluten, providing a detailed analysis to help you make informed decisions.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Does It Matter?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause severe health issues. Symptoms range from digestive problems to skin rashes, fatigue, and even neurological issues. Therefore, knowing whether a product contains gluten is essential for maintaining a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Is Cannabis Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Cannabis, in its natural form, is a gluten-free plant. The cannabis plant itself does not contain gluten proteins, making it safe for individuals with gluten-related disorders. However, the way cannabis is processed and consumed can introduce gluten into the final product. This is where things get a bit more complicated.</p>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Cannabis Products</h2>
    <p>While cannabis itself is gluten-free, the processing and packaging of cannabis products can introduce gluten. Here are some common ways gluten can find its way into cannabis products:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Product Type</th>
                <th>Potential Gluten Source</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Edibles</td>
                <td>Many edibles are made with gluten-containing ingredients like wheat flour or barley malt.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pre-Rolled Joints</td>
                <td>Some pre-rolled joints use glue or adhesives that may contain gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vape Cartridges</td>
                <td>Flavorings or additives in vape cartridges may contain gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Tinctures</td>
                <td>Alcohol-based tinctures may use gluten-containing grains in the distillation process.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
