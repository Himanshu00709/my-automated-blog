<h1>Does Tahini Contain Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Tahini, a creamy paste made from ground sesame seeds, is a staple in many cuisines, particularly in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean dishes. It's a versatile ingredient used in hummus, salad dressings, and even desserts. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding whether tahini contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we'll explore the gluten content in tahini, its nutritional benefits, and how to choose a gluten-free tahini product.</p>

<h2>What is Tahini?</h2>

<p>Tahini is a paste made from toasted and ground sesame seeds. It has a rich, nutty flavor and is often used as a base for sauces, dips, and spreads. Tahini is also a key ingredient in hummus, baba ganoush, and halva. It's a nutrient-dense food, packed with healthy fats, protein, and essential vitamins and minerals.</p>

<h2>Is Tahini Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>The good news is that tahini is naturally gluten-free. Sesame seeds, the primary ingredient in tahini, do not contain gluten. However, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process if the tahini is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing products. Therefore, it's essential to check the label for any gluten-containing ingredients or warnings about cross-contamination.</p>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance, it's crucial to choose tahini products that are certified gluten-free. These products have been tested and verified to contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most people with gluten-related disorders.</p>
