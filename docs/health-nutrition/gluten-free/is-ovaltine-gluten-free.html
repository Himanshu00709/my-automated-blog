    <h1>Is Ovaltine Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Ovaltine has been a beloved beverage for generations, known for its rich, chocolatey flavor and nutritional benefits. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, many people are asking: <strong>Is Ovaltine gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to help you determine whether Ovaltine is safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Ovaltine?</h2>
    <p>Ovaltine is a brand of milk flavoring product made with malt extract, cocoa, and whey. It was originally developed in Switzerland in the early 20th century and has since become a popular drink worldwide. Ovaltine is often consumed as a hot or cold beverage and is marketed as a source of vitamins and minerals, making it a favorite among children and adults alike.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Gluten-Free Diets</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient malabsorption, and autoimmune reactions. As a result, many people follow strict gluten-free diets to avoid these complications.</p>
