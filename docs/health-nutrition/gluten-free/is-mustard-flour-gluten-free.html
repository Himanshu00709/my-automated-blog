<h1>Is Mustard Flour Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Mustard flour, a versatile ingredient used in various culinary applications, has gained popularity among health-conscious individuals and those with dietary restrictions. One of the most common questions surrounding mustard flour is whether it is gluten-free. In this article, we will delve into the details of mustard flour, its gluten content, and its suitability for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>

<h2>What is Mustard Flour?</h2>

<p>Mustard flour is made by grinding mustard seeds into a fine powder. It is commonly used as a spice or condiment, adding a pungent flavor to dishes. Mustard flour is a key ingredient in prepared mustards, salad dressings, and marinades. It is also used in baking and as a thickening agent in soups and sauces.</p>

<p>Cross-contamination can occur if mustard flour is processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, or rye.

Therefore, it is crucial to check the label and verify the gluten-free status of the product.</p>

    <li>Certified Gluten-Free by the Celiac Support Association (CSA)</li>
