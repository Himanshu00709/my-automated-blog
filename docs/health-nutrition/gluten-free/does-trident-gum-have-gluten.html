For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including damage to the small intestine. Even those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity may experience symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue when consuming gluten. Therefore, it's essential to know whether everyday products like chewing gum contain gluten.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Trident Gum</h2>

<p>As you can see, the ingredients listed in Trident gum are generally gluten-free. However, it's always important to check the label for any changes or specific flavor variations that might contain gluten.</p>

<h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination</h2>

<p>Even if the ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during the manufacturing process can introduce gluten into the product. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free products come into contact with gluten-containing products or surfaces during production.</p>

<p>Trident gum is manufactured by Mondelez International, a company that takes food safety seriously. According to their website, Trident gum is produced in facilities that handle gluten-containing products. However, they have stringent cleaning protocols in place to minimize the risk of cross-contamination. Despite these precautions, there is always a slight risk, especially for individuals with severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease.</p>

<h2>Is Trident Gum Certified Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Trident gum is not certified gluten-free by any major gluten-free certification organization. Certification typically involves rigorous testing and auditing of the manufacturing process to ensure that the product contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

<p>While Trident gum does not carry this certification, the ingredients and manufacturing processes suggest that it is likely safe for most people who need to avoid gluten. However, if you have severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, you may want to opt for a gum that is certified gluten-free to be on the safe side.</p>
