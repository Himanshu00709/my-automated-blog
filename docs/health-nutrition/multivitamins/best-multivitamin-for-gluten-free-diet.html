    <h1>Best Multivitamin for a Gluten-Free Diet</h1>
    <p>Adopting a gluten-free diet is essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, eliminating gluten-containing foods can sometimes lead to nutritional deficiencies, as many gluten-free products lack essential vitamins and minerals. To ensure optimal health, it’s crucial to supplement your diet with a high-quality multivitamin specifically designed for gluten-free lifestyles. In this article, we’ll explore the best multivitamins for a gluten-free diet, their benefits, and how to choose the right one for your needs.</p>

A multivitamin can help bridge these nutritional gaps, ensuring your body receives the nutrients it needs to function properly. Common deficiencies in gluten-free diets include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vitamin B12</li>
        <li>Iron</li>
        <li>Calcium</li>
        <li>Vitamin D</li>
        <li>Folate</li>
    </ul>
