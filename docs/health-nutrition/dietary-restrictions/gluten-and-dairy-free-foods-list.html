<h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Foods: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten and dairy-free foods has surged, driven by increasing awareness of food intolerances, allergies, and dietary preferences. Whether you're managing celiac disease, lactose intolerance, or simply exploring a healthier lifestyle, understanding which foods are safe and nutritious is essential. This guide provides a detailed list of gluten and dairy-free foods, along with tips for maintaining a balanced diet.</p>

<h2>What Are Gluten and Dairy?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It acts as a binding agent, giving bread and other baked goods their elasticity and chewiness. Dairy, on the other hand, refers to products derived from milk, such as cheese, yogurt, and butter. Both gluten and dairy can cause adverse reactions in individuals with sensitivities or allergies, leading to symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and skin rashes.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Gluten and Dairy-Free Foods?</h2>

<p>Adopting a gluten and dairy-free diet can offer numerous health benefits, especially for those with specific medical conditions. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can damage the small intestine, leading to malabsorption of nutrients. Similarly, those with lactose intolerance lack the enzyme needed to digest lactose, resulting in digestive discomfort. Even for those without these conditions, eliminating gluten and dairy can reduce inflammation, improve digestion, and promote overall well-being.</p>
