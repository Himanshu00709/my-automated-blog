    <h1>Grocery List for a Gluten and Dairy-Free Diet</h1>
    <p>Adopting a gluten and dairy-free diet can be a transformative step toward better health, especially for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or lactose intolerance. However, navigating the grocery store can be challenging when you're avoiding these common ingredients. This guide will provide you with a comprehensive grocery list, tips for meal planning, and answers to frequently asked questions to make your transition to a gluten and dairy-free lifestyle seamless and enjoyable.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose a Gluten and Dairy-Free Diet?</h2>

Dairy, on the other hand, contains lactose, a sugar that many people struggle to digest. By eliminating these from your diet, you may experience improved digestion, increased energy levels, and reduced inflammation. Whether you're managing a medical condition or simply exploring a healthier lifestyle, a gluten and dairy-free diet can be a great choice.</p>
