    <h1>Is Almond Milk Gluten and Dairy Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Almond milk has become a popular alternative to traditional dairy milk, especially among those with dietary restrictions or preferences. Whether you're lactose intolerant, gluten-sensitive, or simply looking for a plant-based option, almond milk is often a go-to choice. But is almond milk truly gluten and dairy-free? In this article, we'll explore the nutritional profile of almond milk, its suitability for gluten-free and dairy-free diets, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What is Almond Milk?</h2>

    <p>Almond milk is a plant-based beverage made from ground almonds and water. It has a creamy texture and a slightly nutty flavor, making it a versatile ingredient in smoothies, cereals, and baked goods. Unlike dairy milk, almond milk is naturally lactose-free, making it an excellent option for those who are lactose intolerant or allergic to dairy proteins.</p>

    <h2>Is Almond Milk Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, almond milk is naturally gluten-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and since almonds are a nut, they do not contain gluten. However, it's essential to check the label when purchasing almond milk, as some brands may add thickeners or flavorings that contain gluten. Always look for a "gluten-free" certification on the packaging to ensure the product is safe for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>Is Almond Milk Dairy-Free?</h2>

    <p>Absolutely! Almond milk is entirely dairy-free. It is made from almonds and water, with no animal products involved. This makes it an excellent choice for vegans, those with dairy allergies, or anyone looking to reduce their consumption of animal products. However, like with gluten, it's crucial to read the ingredient list to ensure no dairy-derived additives are included.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Profile of Almond Milk</h2>

    <p>Almond milk is not only gluten and dairy-free but also low in calories and fat compared to cow's milk. Here's a breakdown of its nutritional content per cup (240ml):</p>

                <td>2.5-3.5 g</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Protein</td>
                <td>1 g</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Carbohydrates</td>
                <td>1-2 g</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Calcium</td>
                <td>450 mg (fortified)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vitamin D</td>
                <td>100 IU (fortified)</td>
            </tr>
