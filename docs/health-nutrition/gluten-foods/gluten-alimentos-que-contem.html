    <h1>Understanding Gluten: Foods That Contain Gluten</h1>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in certain grains, and it plays a crucial role in the texture and structure of many foods. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues. In this article, we will explore what gluten is, which foods contain it, and how to identify gluten-free alternatives.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. The two main proteins in gluten are glutenin and gliadin, with gliadin being responsible for most of the adverse health effects in people with gluten-related disorders. Gluten gives dough its elasticity, helps it rise, and gives bread its chewy texture. While gluten is harmless for most people, it can cause problems for those with celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergy.</p>

    <h2>Common Foods That Contain Gluten</h2>

    <p>Gluten is present in a wide variety of foods, especially those made from wheat, barley, and rye. Below is a table listing some common foods that contain gluten:</p>

    <table>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. What is celiac disease?</h3>
        <p>Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. It affects about 1% of the population and requires a strict gluten-free diet to manage symptoms and prevent complications.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I have gluten sensitivity without having celiac disease?</h3>
        <p>Yes, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a condition where individuals experience symptoms similar to celiac disease when consuming gluten, but without the intestinal damage. The exact cause of NCGS is not well understood, but avoiding gluten can help alleviate symptoms.</p>

        <h3>3. Is gluten-free healthier for everyone?</h3>
        <p>Not necessarily. A gluten-free diet is essential for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but for others, it may not offer additional health benefits. In fact, some gluten-free products may be lower in fiber and higher in sugar and fat compared to their gluten-containing counterparts.</p>

        <h3>4. How can I tell if a product is gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Look for products labeled "gluten-free" or those that carry a gluten-free certification logo. Always read the ingredient list to check for hidden sources of gluten, such as wheat, barley, or rye.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Understanding which foods contain gluten is crucial for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergy. While gluten is found in many common foods, there are also plenty of gluten-free alternatives available. By being aware of hidden sources of gluten and reading labels carefully, individuals can successfully manage their condition and maintain a healthy, balanced diet. If you suspect you have a gluten-related disorder, consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and guidance.</p>
