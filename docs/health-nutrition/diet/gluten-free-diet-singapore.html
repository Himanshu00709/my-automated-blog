    <h1>Gluten-Free Diet in Singapore: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the gluten-free diet has gained significant popularity, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also among health-conscious individuals.

        <li><strong>Increased Energy Levels:</strong> Some people report feeling more energetic after cutting out gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Nutrient Absorption:</strong> For those with celiac disease, a gluten-free diet can help the intestines heal, improving nutrient absorption.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight Management:</strong> A gluten-free diet can lead to weight loss if it involves cutting out processed foods and refined carbohydrates.</li>
