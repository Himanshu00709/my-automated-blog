    <h1>Gluten-Free Hard Seltzer: A Refreshing Trend in the Beverage World</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the beverage industry has witnessed a significant shift towards healthier and more inclusive drinking options. Among these, gluten-free hard seltzer has emerged as a standout trend, capturing the attention of health-conscious consumers and those with dietary restrictions alike.

The result is a light, refreshing drink that is perfect for those who are gluten-intolerant or simply looking for a healthier alternative to beer or cocktails.</p>

        <li><strong>Gluten-Free:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, hard seltzer offers a safe and enjoyable way to consume alcohol without the risk of adverse reactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Refreshing Taste:</strong> With a wide variety of fruit flavors available, hard seltzers provide a crisp and refreshing taste that is perfect for any occasion.</li>
