<h1>Recipes with Gluten Flour: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Gluten flour, also known as vital wheat gluten, is a high-protein flour made by extracting the gluten from wheat. It is commonly used to improve the texture and elasticity of baked goods, making it a staple in many kitchens, especially for those who bake bread, pizza dough, and other yeast-based recipes. In this article, we will explore the versatility of gluten flour, provide detailed recipes, and answer some frequently asked questions to help you master the art of baking with gluten flour.</p>

<h2>Why Use Gluten Flour?</h2>

<p>Gluten flour is a game-changer for bakers. It contains about 75-80% protein, which is significantly higher than regular all-purpose flour. This high protein content helps create a strong gluten network, resulting in chewy, elastic, and well-structured baked goods. Whether you're making bread, bagels, or pizza dough, gluten flour can elevate your recipes to the next level. Additionally, it is often used in gluten-free baking to mimic the texture of traditional wheat-based products.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten Flour</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use gluten flour in place of regular flour?</h3>
