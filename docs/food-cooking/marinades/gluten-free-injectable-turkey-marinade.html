<p>Using a gluten-free injectable turkey marinade is straightforward, but there are a few key steps to ensure the best results:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Marinade:</strong> If you’re using a store-bought marinade, ensure it’s labeled gluten-free. If you’re making your own, combine the ingredients in a bowl and mix well.</li>
