<h2>Preparing Gluten-Free Shells for Stuffing</h2>

<p>Preparing gluten-free shells for stuffing requires a bit of care to ensure they don't become too soft or fall apart. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> While the shells are cooling, prepare your stuffing. This could be a mixture of sautéed vegetables, cheeses, meats, or any combination you prefer.</li>
    <li><strong>Stuff the Shells:</strong> Carefully fill each shell with the prepared stuffing. A small spoon or piping bag can make this process easier.</li>
