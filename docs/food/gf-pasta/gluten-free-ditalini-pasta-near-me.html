<h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Ditalini Pasta</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free ditalini pasta is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Boil Water:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Use more water than you would for regular pasta to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Pasta:</strong> Once the water is boiling, add the gluten-free ditalini pasta. Stir immediately to prevent clumping.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook Time:</strong> Gluten-free pasta often cooks faster than traditional pasta, so keep a close eye on it. Check the package instructions for the recommended cooking time, usually around 7-10 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Test for Doneness:</strong> Taste the pasta a minute or two before the recommended cooking time to ensure it doesn't become mushy. Gluten-free pasta can go from al dente to overcooked quickly.</li>
    <li><strong>Drain and Serve:</strong> Once the pasta is cooked to your liking, drain it in a colander and rinse briefly with warm water to remove excess starch. Serve immediately with your favorite sauce or in a soup.</li>
</ol>
