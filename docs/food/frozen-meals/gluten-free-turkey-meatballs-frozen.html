    </ul>

    <h2>How Are Gluten-Free Turkey Meatballs Made?</h2>

    <p>The process of making gluten-free turkey meatballs involves carefully selecting ingredients that are free from gluten. Traditional meatballs often use breadcrumbs as a binding agent, but in gluten-free versions, alternatives like almond flour, gluten-free oats, or rice flour are used. Here’s a breakdown of the typical ingredients and preparation method:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Ground Turkey</td>
                <td>Primary protein source, lean and healthy.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Almond Flour</td>
                <td>Gluten-free binding agent, adds moisture.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Eggs</td>
                <td>Helps bind the ingredients together.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>Adds flavor without gluten-containing additives.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>Used for cooking, adds healthy fats.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The preparation involves mixing the ingredients, forming the mixture into balls, and then baking or frying them. Once cooked, the meatballs are flash-frozen to preserve their freshness and flavor. This process ensures that they retain their nutritional value and taste when reheated.</p>
