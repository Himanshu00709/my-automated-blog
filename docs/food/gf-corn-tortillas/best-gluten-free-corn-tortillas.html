    <h1>Best Gluten-Free Corn Tortillas: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply choosing a gluten-free lifestyle, finding the right tortillas can be a challenge. Corn tortillas are a staple in many cuisines, especially in Mexican and Central American dishes. Fortunately, corn tortillas are naturally gluten-free, making them a safe and delicious option for those avoiding gluten. However, not all corn tortillas are created equal. In this guide, we’ll explore the best gluten-free corn tortillas available, what to look for when buying them, and how to use them in your favorite recipes.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Corn Tortillas?</h2>
    <p>Corn tortillas are made from masa harina, a type of corn flour that is naturally gluten-free. This makes them an excellent choice for those who need to avoid gluten. Unlike flour tortillas, which are typically made from wheat, corn tortillas are free from gluten-containing grains. They are also lower in calories and carbohydrates, making them a healthier option for many people. Additionally, corn tortillas are rich in fiber and essential nutrients like magnesium and potassium, which are beneficial for overall health.</p>

    <h2>What to Look for in Gluten-Free Corn Tortillas</h2>
    <p>When shopping for gluten-free corn tortillas, it’s important to read the labels carefully. Here are some key factors to consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Ensure that the tortillas are made from 100% corn masa and do not contain any wheat, barley, or rye. Some brands may add fillers or preservatives that could contain gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Certification:</strong> Look for a gluten-free certification on the packaging. This ensures that the product has been tested and meets the strict standards for gluten-free products.</li>
        <li><strong>Texture and Flexibility:</strong> The best corn tortillas should be soft and pliable, making them easy to fold or roll without breaking. Some brands may be too dry or brittle, which can affect the overall eating experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> Corn tortillas should have a fresh, slightly sweet corn flavor. Avoid brands that taste stale or have an off-putting aftertaste.</li>
    </ul>
