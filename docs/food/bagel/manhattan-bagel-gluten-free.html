<h1>Manhattan Bagel Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For those who love bagels but need to avoid gluten, the search for a delicious and safe option can be challenging. Manhattan Bagel, a popular bagel chain, has stepped up to the plate by offering gluten-free options that cater to the needs of those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about Manhattan Bagel’s gluten-free offerings, from their ingredients to their preparation methods, and why they’re a great choice for anyone on a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What Makes Manhattan Bagel Gluten-Free Options Stand Out?</h2>

<p>Manhattan Bagel has gained a reputation for its commitment to quality and variety. Their gluten-free bagels are no exception. Made with high-quality, gluten-free ingredients, these bagels are designed to mimic the taste and texture of traditional bagels without the gluten. The company takes extra precautions to avoid cross-contamination, ensuring that their gluten-free options are safe for those with celiac disease.</p>

<p>One of the standout features of Manhattan Bagel’s gluten-free bagels is their texture. Many gluten-free products can be dry or crumbly, but Manhattan Bagel has managed to create a product that is moist, chewy, and satisfying. This is achieved through a combination of gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch, which work together to create a texture that closely resembles that of a traditional bagel.</p>

<h2>Ingredients and Nutritional Information</h2>

<p>Understanding the ingredients in your food is crucial, especially when you have dietary restrictions. Manhattan Bagel’s gluten-free bagels are made with a blend of gluten-free flours, water, yeast, sugar, salt, and xanthan gum. Xanthan gum is a common ingredient in gluten-free baking, as it helps to bind the dough and give it a more elastic texture.</p>
