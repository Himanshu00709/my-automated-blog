    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Gluten-Free Penne</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gluten-free penne pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta and set it aside, reserving a cup of the pasta water for later use.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and chopped shallot, and sauté until fragrant and softened, about 2-3 minutes. Be careful not to burn the garlic, as it can become bitter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Vodka</h3>
    <p>Pour the vodka into the skillet and let it simmer for about 2 minutes, allowing the alcohol to cook off. This step is crucial as it helps to enhance the flavor of the sauce.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Incorporate the Tomato Puree and Cream</h3>
    <p>Add the tomato puree to the skillet and stir well to combine. Let the sauce simmer for about 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Then, stir in the heavy cream and red pepper flakes. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine the Pasta and Sauce</h3>
    <p>Add the cooked gluten-free penne to the skillet and toss to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the chopped fresh basil and grated Parmesan cheese. Serve the gluten-free penne alla vodka hot, garnished with additional basil and Parmesan if desired.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Penne alla Vodka</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free penne alla vodka is not only a delicious dish but also offers several nutritional benefits. Gluten-free pasta is often made from whole grains or legumes, which are rich in fiber, protein, and essential nutrients. The tomato puree provides a good source of vitamins A and C, as well as antioxidants like lycopene, which has been linked to various health benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease and certain cancers. The addition of fresh basil and garlic adds a boost of flavor along with their own set of health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free pasta?</h3>

        <h3>Is it necessary to use vodka in the recipe?</h3>
        <p>While vodka is a traditional ingredient in penne alla vodka and helps to enhance the flavor of the sauce, you can omit it if you prefer. The dish will still be delicious, though it may lack the slight tang that vodka provides.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a dairy-free version of gluten-free penne alla vodka by substituting the heavy cream with a non-dairy alternative like coconut cream or cashew cream. You can also use a dairy-free Parmesan cheese or omit it altogether.</p>
