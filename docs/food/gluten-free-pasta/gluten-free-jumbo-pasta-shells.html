    <h2>Cooking Tips for Gluten-Free Jumbo Pasta Shells</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free jumbo pasta shells requires a slightly different approach than traditional pasta. Here are some tips to ensure your pasta turns out perfectly:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to absorb more water, so be sure to use a large pot with plenty of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can clump together if not stirred regularly. Stir the pasta occasionally to keep the shells separate.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can go from perfectly cooked to overcooked quickly. Start checking for doneness a minute or two before the recommended cooking time on the package.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Some gluten-free pastas benefit from a quick rinse after cooking to remove excess starch, but be cautious as this can also remove some of the pasta's natural flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Pair with the Right Sauce:</strong> Gluten-free pasta shells pair well with a variety of sauces, from creamy Alfredo to tangy marinara. Experiment with different combinations to find your favorite.</li>
    </ul>
