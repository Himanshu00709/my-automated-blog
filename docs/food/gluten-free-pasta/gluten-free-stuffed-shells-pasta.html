<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Cook the Pasta Shells</h3>

<p>Begin by cooking the gluten-free jumbo pasta shells according to the package instructions. Be sure to cook them al dente, as they will continue to soften in the oven. Once cooked, drain the shells and set them aside to cool slightly.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Filling</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, and egg. Mix until well combined. In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat and sauté the minced garlic until fragrant. Add the chopped spinach and cook until wilted. Allow the spinach to cool slightly, then mix it into the cheese mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<h3>3. Stuff the Shells</h3>

<p>Using a spoon or a piping bag, carefully fill each pasta shell with the cheese and spinach mixture. Be generous with the filling, but avoid overstuffing, as the shells may burst during baking.</p>

<h3>4. Assemble the Dish</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange the stuffed shells in the dish, seam side up. Pour the remaining marinara sauce over the shells, ensuring they are well-covered. Sprinkle additional mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top for a golden, cheesy crust.</p>

<h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>

<p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown. Let the dish cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Stuffed Shells</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the stuffed shells up to a day in advance. Simply assemble the dish, cover it tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. When you're ready to bake, remove the plastic wrap, cover with foil, and bake as directed. You may need to add a few extra minutes to the baking time if the dish is cold from the fridge.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free stuffed shells?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Gluten-free stuffed shells freeze well. After assembling the dish, cover it tightly with foil and freeze for up to 3 months. When you're ready to enjoy, bake the frozen dish at 375°F (190°C) for about 1 hour, or until heated through and bubbly.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of ricotta cheese?</h3>
    <p>If you're not a fan of ricotta, you can substitute it with cottage cheese, mascarpone, or even a dairy-free alternative like tofu ricotta. Each option will provide a slightly different texture and flavor, so choose based on your preference.</p>

    <h3>Are gluten-free pasta shells easy to find?</h3>
    <p>Yes, most grocery stores carry gluten-free pasta shells in the gluten-free or health food section. Popular brands like Barilla, Jovial, and Tinkyada offer gluten-free options that work well for this recipe.</p>
