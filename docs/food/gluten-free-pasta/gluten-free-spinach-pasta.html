    <h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Spinach Pasta</h2>
    <p>Cooking gluten-free spinach pasta is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to keep in mind to ensure the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use plenty of water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so using a large pot of boiling water helps prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir frequently:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can clump together if not stirred regularly during cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness early:</strong> Gluten-free pasta often cooks faster than wheat pasta, so start checking for doneness a minute or two before the recommended cooking time.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with caution:</strong> Rinsing gluten-free pasta can remove the starch that helps sauces adhere, so it’s best to avoid rinsing unless the recipe specifically calls for it.</li>
    </ol>
