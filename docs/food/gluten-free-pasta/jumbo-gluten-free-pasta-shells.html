    <h2>How to Cook Jumbo Gluten-Free Pasta Shells</h2>

    <p>Cooking jumbo gluten-free pasta shells is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to keep in mind:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil Water:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Use plenty of water to prevent the shells from sticking together.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Pasta:</strong> Gently add the jumbo gluten-free pasta shells to the boiling water. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Time:</strong> Follow the package instructions for cooking time, but start checking a minute or two before the recommended time. Gluten-free pasta can go from perfectly cooked to overcooked quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Rinse:</strong> Once cooked, drain the pasta and rinse it briefly with cold water to stop the cooking process and remove excess starch.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve or Stuff:</strong> Use the shells immediately in your favorite recipe, or let them cool if you plan to stuff them.</li>
    </ol>
