    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Vegetable Pasta</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free vegetable pasta at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a simple step-by-step guide to creating your own vegetable pasta:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Choose Your Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Select fresh, high-quality vegetables such as zucchini, carrots, sweet potatoes, or butternut squash. These vegetables are ideal for spiralizing or slicing into pasta-like shapes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Wash and peel the vegetables if necessary. Use a spiralizer, mandoline slicer, or julienne peeler to create thin, pasta-like strands. If you don’t have these tools, you can also use a sharp knife to cut the vegetables into thin strips.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Vegetable Pasta</h3>
    <p>Unlike traditional pasta, vegetable pasta cooks very quickly. You can sauté it in a pan with a little olive oil for 2-3 minutes, or blanch it in boiling water for 1-2 minutes. Be careful not to overcook, as the vegetables can become mushy.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Your Favorite Sauce</h3>
    <p>Once your vegetable pasta is cooked, toss it with your favorite sauce. Tomato-based sauces, pesto, or a simple olive oil and garlic dressing all work well. You can also add protein such as grilled chicken, shrimp, or tofu for a complete meal.</p>
