<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Ravioli at Home</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free ravioli at home is easier than you might think. With a few simple ingredients and some patience, you can create a delicious and satisfying meal that rivals any restaurant dish. Here’s a step-by-step guide to making your own gluten-free ravioli:</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend (e.g., rice flour, almond flour, or a pre-made mix)</li>
    <li>3 large eggs (or flax eggs for a vegan option)</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1-2 tablespoons water (as needed)</li>
    <li>1 cup filling of your choice (e.g., ricotta cheese, spinach, butternut squash)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the eggs. Gradually mix the flour into the eggs until a dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add water one tablespoon at a time until it reaches the desired consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes until smooth. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Divide the dough into four equal parts. Roll out one portion at a time using a rolling pin or pasta machine until it is thin but still sturdy enough to hold the filling.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the Filling:</strong> Place small spoonfuls of your chosen filling onto one sheet of dough, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Brush a little water around each filling mound to help seal the ravioli.</li>
    <li><strong>Seal the Ravioli:</strong> Place another sheet of dough over the filling and press down around each mound to seal. Use a ravioli cutter or a knife to cut out individual ravioli.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the Ravioli:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully add the ravioli and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain and serve with your favorite sauce.</li>
</ol>
