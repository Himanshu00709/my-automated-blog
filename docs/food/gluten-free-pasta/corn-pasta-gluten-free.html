    <h1>Corn Pasta: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free alternatives has skyrocketed, and corn pasta has emerged as a popular choice for those seeking a delicious and nutritious option. Whether you're managing celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply exploring healthier dietary options, corn pasta offers a versatile and satisfying solution. This article delves into the world of corn pasta, exploring its benefits, nutritional profile, and how it compares to traditional wheat pasta.</p>

    <h2>What is Corn Pasta?</h2>
    <p>Corn pasta is a type of pasta made primarily from corn flour or cornmeal. Unlike traditional pasta, which is made from wheat flour, corn pasta is naturally gluten-free, making it an excellent choice for individuals with gluten-related disorders. The process of making corn pasta involves milling corn into a fine flour, which is then mixed with water and sometimes other ingredients like rice flour or quinoa flour to enhance texture and flavor. The dough is then shaped into various pasta forms, such as spaghetti, penne, or fusilli, and dried to preserve its shelf life.</p>
