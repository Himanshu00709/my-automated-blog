    <h2>Cooking Tips for Perfect Jovial Gluten-Free Penne</h2>
    <p>Cooking gluten-free pasta can be a bit different from cooking traditional pasta. Here are some tips to ensure your Jovial Gluten-Free Penne turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Always cook your pasta in a large pot of boiling water. This prevents the pasta from sticking together and ensures even cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt the Water:</strong> Don’t forget to salt the water generously. This enhances the flavor of the pasta.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can be more prone to sticking, so be sure to stir it frequently during cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Test for Doneness:</strong> Jovial Gluten-Free Penne typically cooks in about 10-12 minutes. Start testing for doneness a minute or two before the recommended cooking time to avoid overcooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Unlike traditional pasta, gluten-free pasta should not be rinsed after cooking. Rinsing can remove the starch that helps sauces cling to the pasta.</li>
    </ul>
