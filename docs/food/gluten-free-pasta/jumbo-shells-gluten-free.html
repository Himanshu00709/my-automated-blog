<h2>How to Cook Jumbo Shells Gluten-Free</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free jumbo shells is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to keep in mind to ensure the best results. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Boil Water:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Use about 4-6 quarts of water for every 8 ounces of pasta.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Pasta:</strong> Gently add the jumbo shells to the boiling water. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook Time:</strong> Follow the package instructions for cooking time, usually around 8-10 minutes. Gluten-free pasta can become mushy if overcooked, so keep an eye on it.</li>
    <li><strong>Drain and Rinse:</strong> Once the shells are al dente, drain them in a colander and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.</li>
    <li><strong>Stuff and Bake:</strong> If you’re making stuffed shells, fill them with your desired filling, place them in a baking dish, cover with sauce, and bake until heated through.</li>
</ol>
