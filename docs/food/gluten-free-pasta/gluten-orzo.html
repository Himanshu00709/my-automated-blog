<h1>Gluten Orzo: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Orzo, a rice-shaped pasta, has been a staple in Mediterranean cuisine for centuries. Traditionally made from wheat, orzo is a versatile ingredient that can be used in soups, salads, and main dishes. However, with the rise of gluten intolerance and celiac disease, gluten-free orzo has become increasingly popular. In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about gluten orzo, including its nutritional benefits, how to cook it, and some delicious recipes to try at home.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten Orzo?</h2>

<p>Gluten orzo is a type of pasta that is shaped like rice grains but is made from wheat flour, which contains gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye that gives dough its elasticity and helps it rise. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues. As a result, gluten-free orzo has been developed using alternative flours such as rice, corn, or quinoa.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten Orzo</h2>

<p>Gluten orzo, like traditional orzo, is a good source of carbohydrates, which are essential for energy. It also contains small amounts of protein and fiber. However, the nutritional profile can vary depending on the type of flour used. For example, orzo made from whole wheat flour will have more fiber and nutrients than orzo made from refined flour. Below is a table comparing the nutritional content of traditional orzo and gluten-free orzo:</p>

    <li><strong>Cook:</strong> Cook the orzo for about 8-10 minutes, or until it is al dente. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Drain:</strong> Drain the orzo in a colander and rinse it briefly with cold water to stop the cooking process.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the orzo as a side dish, or use it as a base for salads, soups, or main dishes.</li>
