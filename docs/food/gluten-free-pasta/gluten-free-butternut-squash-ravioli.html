    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Pasta Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by making the gluten-free pasta dough. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and a pinch of salt. Create a well in the center and crack the eggs into it. Gradually mix the flour into the eggs until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Butternut Squash Filling</h3>

    <p>While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the mashed butternut squash, ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Ravioli</h3>

    <p>After the dough has rested, divide it into four equal portions. Roll out one portion at a time into a thin sheet using a rolling pin or pasta machine. Place small spoonfuls of the butternut squash filling onto the sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Brush the edges of the dough with water, then place another sheet of dough on top. Press around the filling to seal the ravioli, then cut them into individual pieces using a ravioli cutter or a sharp knife.</p>

    <h3>4. Cook the Ravioli</h3>

    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully add the ravioli and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Remove the ravioli with a slotted spoon and set aside.</p>

    <h3>5. Prepare the Sage Butter Sauce</h3>

    <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the fresh sage leaves and cook until they become crispy. Remove the sage leaves and set aside. Add the cooked ravioli to the skillet and toss to coat them in the sage-infused oil. Serve the ravioli topped with the crispy sage leaves and an extra sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.</p>
