    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Pasta Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by making the pasta dough. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and a pinch of salt. Create a well in the center and crack the eggs into it. Gradually mix the flour into the eggs until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Butternut Squash Filling</h3>

    <p>While the dough rests, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the mashed butternut squash, ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined. The filling should be creamy but not too runny.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Ravioli</h3>

    <p>Roll out the rested dough into thin sheets using a pasta machine or rolling pin. Place small spoonfuls of the butternut squash filling onto one sheet of dough, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Brush the edges with water, then place another sheet of dough on top. Press around the filling to seal the ravioli, then cut them into individual pieces using a ravioli cutter or knife.</p>

    <h3>4. Cook and Serve</h3>

    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully add the ravioli and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain and toss with your favorite sauce. A simple sage butter sauce or a light marinara works wonderfully with this dish.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Butternut Squash Ravioli</h2>

    <p>This dish is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. Butternut squash is an excellent source of vitamin A, which supports eye health, and vitamin C, which boosts the immune system. The gluten-free flour blend provides a safe alternative for those avoiding gluten, while the ricotta and Parmesan cheeses add a dose of protein and calcium.</p>
