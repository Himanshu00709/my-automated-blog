<h2>How to Cook Basta Pasta Gluten-Free</h2>

<p>Cooking Basta Pasta Gluten-Free is just as easy as cooking traditional pasta. Here’s a simple step-by-step guide to get you started:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Boil Water:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Use about 4-6 quarts of water for every 8 ounces of pasta.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Pasta:</strong> Once the water is boiling, add the Basta Pasta Gluten-Free. Stir gently to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook:</strong> Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente. Be sure to check the package instructions for specific cooking times.</li>
    <li><strong>Drain:</strong> Drain the pasta in a colander, but do not rinse. Rinsing can remove the starch that helps sauces adhere to the pasta.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Toss the pasta with your favorite sauce and toppings, and enjoy!</li>
</ol>

<p>One tip to keep in mind is that gluten-free pasta can sometimes cook faster than traditional pasta, so it's important to keep an eye on it to avoid overcooking. Overcooked gluten-free pasta can become mushy, so aim for that perfect al dente texture.</p>
