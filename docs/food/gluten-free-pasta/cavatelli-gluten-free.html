<h1>Cavatelli Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free alternatives has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the desire for healthier eating habits. Among the many traditional pasta varieties, cavatelli has emerged as a favorite for those seeking a gluten-free option. This article delves into the world of gluten-free cavatelli, exploring its origins, nutritional benefits, and how you can enjoy this delightful pasta in your gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What is Cavatelli?</h2>

<p>Cavatelli is a type of pasta that originates from Southern Italy, particularly the regions of Puglia, Basilicata, and Campania. Traditionally made from semolina flour and water, cavatelli is known for its small, shell-like shape with a slight indentation, which makes it perfect for holding onto sauces. The name "cavatelli" comes from the Italian word "cavare," meaning "to hollow," referring to the pasta's characteristic shape.</p>

<p>While traditional cavatelli contains gluten, the gluten-free version is made using alternative flours such as rice flour, corn flour, or a blend of gluten-free flours. This adaptation allows those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease to enjoy this classic Italian dish without compromising on taste or texture.</p>
