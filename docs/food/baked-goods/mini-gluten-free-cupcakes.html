    <h2>Tips for Baking Perfect Mini Gluten-Free Cupcakes</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free cupcakes can be a bit tricky, but with the right techniques, you can achieve perfect results every time. Here are some tips to help you along the way:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Reliable Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that is specifically designed for baking to ensure the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cupcakes. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure Ingredients Accurately:</strong> Gluten-free baking requires precision. Use a kitchen scale for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Moisture:</strong> Gluten-free baked goods can sometimes be dry. Adding ingredients like yogurt, applesauce, or extra eggs can help keep the cupcakes moist.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake at the Right Temperature:</strong> Mini cupcakes bake quickly, so keep an eye on them to prevent overbaking. Typically, they take about 10-12 minutes at 350°F (175°C).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Mini Gluten-Free Cupcakes</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I make gluten-free cupcakes without a flour blend?</h3>
        <p>While it’s possible to use single gluten-free flours like almond or coconut flour, a blend is generally recommended for the best texture and flavor. Single flours can result in dense or crumbly cupcakes.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I store gluten-free cupcakes?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cupcakes can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, refrigerate them for up to a week or freeze for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I use regular frosting on gluten-free cupcakes?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular frosting as long as it doesn’t contain gluten-containing ingredients. Alternatively, you can make your own gluten-free frosting using powdered sugar, butter, and flavorings.</p>

        <h3>4. Are gluten-free cupcakes healthier?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cupcakes are not inherently healthier than regular cupcakes, as they can still contain sugar and fat. However, they are a better option for those with gluten-related health issues.</p>
