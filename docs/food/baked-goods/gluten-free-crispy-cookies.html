<h2>Tips for Baking Perfect Gluten-Free Crispy Cookies</h2>

<p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, especially if you're aiming for that perfect crispy texture. Here are some tips to help you achieve the best results:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use the Right Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. A blend of flours, such as almond flour and rice flour, can provide the best texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Chilling the dough before baking helps prevent the cookies from spreading too much, resulting in a crispier texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake at the Right Temperature:</strong> Baking at a slightly lower temperature (around 325°F) can help achieve a crispy texture without burning the cookies.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Parchment Paper:</strong> Lining your baking sheet with parchment paper prevents the cookies from sticking and ensures even baking.</li>
</ul>
