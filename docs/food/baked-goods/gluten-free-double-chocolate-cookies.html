    <h1>Gluten-Free Double Chocolate Cookies: A Delicious Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>For those who love chocolate but need to avoid gluten, gluten-free double chocolate cookies are a dream come true. These cookies are rich, decadent, and perfect for satisfying your sweet tooth without compromising your dietary needs. Whether you're gluten-intolerant, celiac, or simply looking to reduce gluten in your diet, these cookies are a must-try. In this blog post, we'll explore everything you need to know about making and enjoying gluten-free double chocolate cookies.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Double Chocolate Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has come a long way in recent years, and gluten-free double chocolate cookies are a testament to how delicious and satisfying gluten-free treats can be. These cookies are made with gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free flour blend, which not only make them safe for those with gluten sensitivities but also add a unique flavor and texture. The double chocolate aspect—using both cocoa powder and chocolate chips—ensures that every bite is packed with rich, chocolatey goodness.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to make your gluten-free double chocolate cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven</strong> to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients</strong>: In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugars</strong>: In a large bowl, beat the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the eggs and vanilla</strong>: Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients</strong>: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop the dough</strong>: Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong>: Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Double Chocolate Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend</strong>: Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough</strong>: Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined to keep them tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough</strong>: If you have time, chilling the dough for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness</strong>: Gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky to judge. They should be slightly underbaked when you take them out of the oven, as they will continue to cook on the baking sheet.</li>
    </ul>
