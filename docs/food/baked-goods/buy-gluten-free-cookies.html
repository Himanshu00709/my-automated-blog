    <h1>Buy Gluten-Free Cookies: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and gluten-free cookies are no exception. Whether you have celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply prefer a gluten-free diet, finding delicious and safe cookies can be a challenge. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about buying gluten-free cookies, from understanding what "gluten-free" really means to finding the best brands and flavors available on the market.</p>

    <h2>What Does Gluten-Free Mean?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. Gluten-free products, including cookies, are made without these grains and are safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <p>However, it's important to note that not all gluten-free products are created equal. Some may still contain trace amounts of gluten due to cross-contamination during manufacturing. Always look for products that are certified gluten-free by a reputable organization, such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO).</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Cookies?</h2>

    <p>There are several reasons why someone might choose gluten-free cookies:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Health Reasons:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, gluten-free cookies are a necessity to avoid adverse health effects.</li>
        <li><strong>Dietary Preferences:</strong> Some people choose a gluten-free diet as part of a healthier lifestyle, even if they don't have a medical condition that requires it.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety:</strong> Gluten-free cookies come in a wide range of flavors and textures, offering something for everyone.</li>
