    <h1>Gluten-Free Welsh Cakes: A Delicious Tradition Reimagined</h1>
    <p>Welsh cakes, a beloved treat from Wales, have been a staple in Welsh households for centuries. These delightful, griddle-baked cakes are traditionally made with flour, butter, sugar, and dried fruit, offering a perfect balance of sweetness and texture. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying this classic treat can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free Welsh cakes—a modern twist on a traditional favorite that allows everyone to savor the taste of Wales without compromising their health.</p>

    <h2>The History of Welsh Cakes</h2>
    <p>Welsh cakes, also known as "picau ar y maen" in Welsh, have a rich history that dates back to the 19th century.

The simplicity of the ingredients—flour, butter, sugar, eggs, and currants—made them a popular choice for families across Wales. Over time, Welsh cakes became a symbol of Welsh culture and tradition, often enjoyed during tea time or as a sweet treat on special occasions.</p>

Symptoms can range from digestive issues to skin rashes and fatigue. For those affected, adopting a gluten-free diet is essential for maintaining good health. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free baking has made it possible to enjoy traditional recipes like Welsh cakes without the worry of gluten-related health issues.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Welsh Cakes</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free Welsh cakes is a straightforward process that closely mirrors the traditional method. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the butter:</strong> Rub the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate the sugar and currants:</strong> Stir in the caster sugar and currants until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Bind the dough:</strong> Beat the egg and add it to the mixture, along with enough milk to form a firm dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll and cut:</strong> Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 5mm thickness and cut into rounds using a cookie cutter.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook on a griddle:</strong> Heat a griddle or frying pan over medium heat and cook the cakes for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Dust with caster sugar and enjoy warm or cold.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Welsh Cakes</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free Welsh cakes turn out perfectly, consider the following tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the right flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Opt for a blend that mimics the texture of wheat flour, such as a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overwork the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cakes. Handle the dough as little as possible to maintain a light texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor the heat:</strong> Cooking on too high a heat can cause the cakes to burn on the outside while remaining raw inside. Medium heat is ideal.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> While currants are traditional, feel free to experiment with other dried fruits, spices, or even chocolate chips for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>
