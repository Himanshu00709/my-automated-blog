    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your double chocolate gluten-free muffins:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure there are no lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Chocolate Chips:</strong> Fold in the dark chocolate chips, reserving a few to sprinkle on top of the muffins before baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill Muffin Tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full. Sprinkle the reserved chocolate chips on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Muffins</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your double chocolate gluten-free muffins turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough muffins. Mix until just combined to keep them light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Moisture:</strong> Gluten-free baked goods can sometimes be dry. Adding ingredients like yogurt, applesauce, or extra oil can help keep the muffins moist.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add nuts, dried fruit, or different types of chocolate chips to customize your muffins.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary. Almond flour, coconut flour, or oat flour can be used, but you may need to adjust the liquid content accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>

        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 3 months. Just thaw them at room temperature or warm them in the microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I reduce the sugar in this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can reduce the sugar to suit your taste. However, keep in mind that sugar not only adds sweetness but also contributes to the texture and moisture of the muffins. You may need to adjust other ingredients to compensate.</p>
