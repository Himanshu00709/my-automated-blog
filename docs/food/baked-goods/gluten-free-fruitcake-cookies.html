<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fruitcake Cookies</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours such as coconut flour or a gluten-free all-purpose blend. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>Are these cookies suitable for people with nut allergies?</h3>
    <p>This recipe contains almond flour and nuts, so it is not suitable for those with nut allergies. You can try substituting the almond flour with a nut-free alternative like sunflower seed flour.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make these cookies vegan by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of a regular egg.</p>

    <h3>How do I know if my oats are gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Not all oats are gluten-free, as they can be contaminated with gluten during processing. Look for oats that are specifically labeled as gluten-free to ensure they are safe for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivities.</p>
