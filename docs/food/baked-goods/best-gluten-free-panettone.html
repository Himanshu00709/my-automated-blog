    <h1>Best Gluten-Free Panettone: A Holiday Delight</h1>
    <p>Panettone, the iconic Italian Christmas bread, is a staple during the holiday season. Its light, fluffy texture and rich, fruity flavor make it a favorite for many. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying traditional panettone can be a challenge. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free baking has brought about a variety of gluten-free panettone options that are just as delicious as their traditional counterparts. In this article, we’ll explore the best gluten-free panettone options available, what makes them special, and how to choose the right one for your holiday table.</p>

    <h2>What is Panettone?</h2>
    <p>Panettone is a traditional Italian sweet bread that originated in Milan. It is typically enjoyed during the Christmas and New Year holidays. The bread is characterized by its tall, domed shape and is often filled with candied fruits, raisins, and citrus zest. The dough is enriched with butter, eggs, and sugar, giving it a rich, tender crumb. Traditionally, panettone is made with wheat flour, but gluten-free versions use alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or a blend of gluten-free flours to achieve a similar texture and taste.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Panettone?</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and skin problems. Gluten-free panettone allows those with dietary restrictions to enjoy this holiday treat without compromising their health.
