    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Vegan Brioche Buns</h2>

    <p>Now that you know the key ingredients, let’s dive into the process of making these buns. Follow these steps for the best results:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Yeast Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine warm plant-based milk (around 110°F) with a teaspoon of sugar and the active dry yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. This step ensures the yeast is active and ready to help the dough rise.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together your gluten-free flour blend, psyllium husk, and a pinch of salt. This ensures even distribution of the ingredients and prevents clumping.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add the yeast mixture, melted vegan butter, and maple syrup to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms. The dough will be sticky, but avoid adding too much extra flour, as this can make the buns dense.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Let the Dough Rise</h3>
    <p>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours. The dough should double in size. This step is crucial for achieving the light, airy texture of brioche.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Shape the Buns</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, divide it into equal portions and shape them into round buns. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving enough space between each bun for expansion.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Brush the tops of the buns with a little plant-based milk or melted vegan butter for a golden finish. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the buns are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Vegan Brioche Buns</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I make these buns without yeast?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use baking powder or baking soda as a leavening agent, but the texture will be denser and less like traditional brioche.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I store gluten-free vegan brioche buns?</h3>
        <p>Store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or freeze them for longer storage. Reheat in the oven or toaster before serving.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I use a different sweetener?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute maple syrup with agave, date syrup, or even coconut sugar, depending on your preference.</p>

        <h3>4. Are these buns suitable for people with nut allergies?</h3>
        <p>Yes, as long as you use a nut-free plant-based milk and ensure your other ingredients are free from cross-contamination.</p>
