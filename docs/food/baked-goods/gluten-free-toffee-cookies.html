    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the process of making these delicious gluten-free toffee cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and make cleanup easier.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Set this aside for later.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for creating a soft and chewy texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Make sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in the Toffee Bits</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the toffee bits until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your delicious gluten-free toffee cookies!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Toffee Cookies</h2>

    <p>Here are some additional tips to ensure your cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Make sure your butter and eggs are at room temperature before starting. This helps create a smoother dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too soft, chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before baking. This will help the cookies hold their shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to add other mix-ins like chocolate chips or nuts for extra flavor and texture.</li>
    </ul>
