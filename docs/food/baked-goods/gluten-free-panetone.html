    <h1>Gluten-Free Panettone: A Delicious Holiday Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Panettone, the iconic Italian Christmas bread, is a staple during the holiday season. Its light, fluffy texture and rich, fruity flavor make it a favorite among many. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying traditional panettone can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free panettone—a delightful alternative that allows everyone to partake in this festive treat. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free panettone, from its origins to how you can make or buy it, and answer some common questions about this holiday delicacy.</p>

    <h2>What is Panettone?</h2>
    <p>Panettone is a traditional Italian sweet bread that originated in Milan. It is typically enjoyed during the Christmas and New Year holidays. The bread is characterized by its tall, domed shape and is often filled with raisins, candied fruits, and citrus zest. The dough is enriched with butter, eggs, and sugar, giving it a soft, airy texture that is both rich and satisfying.</p>

    <h2>The Rise of Gluten-Free Panettone</h2>
    <p>With the increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders, such as celiac disease and gluten sensitivity, the demand for gluten-free alternatives to traditional foods has grown significantly. Gluten-free panettone is one such innovation that has gained popularity in recent years. Made with gluten-free flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or a blend of gluten-free starches, this version of panettone retains the classic flavors and textures of the original while being safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>How is Gluten-Free Panettone Made?</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free panettone requires a bit of skill and patience, as gluten-free dough behaves differently from traditional wheat-based dough. Here’s a basic overview of the process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour Blend:</strong> A combination of gluten-free flours and starches is used to mimic the texture of wheat flour. Common choices include rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch.</li>
        <li><strong>Leavening:</strong> Yeast is still used to leaven the dough, but the process may take longer due to the absence of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Enrichment:</strong> Butter, eggs, and sugar are added to the dough to create a rich, tender crumb.</li>
        <li><strong>Filling:</strong> Raisins, candied fruits, and citrus zest are mixed into the dough to give it the classic panettone flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking:</strong> The dough is baked in a tall, cylindrical pan to achieve the traditional domed shape.</li>
    </ul>
