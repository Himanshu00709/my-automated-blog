    <h1>Gluten-Free Half Moon Cookies: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Half moon cookies, with their distinctive half-chocolate, half-vanilla frosting, have long been a beloved treat in bakeries across the United States. Traditionally made with wheat flour, these cookies can be off-limits for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. However, with the rise of gluten-free baking, it's now possible to enjoy these delightful cookies without compromising on taste or texture. In this article, we'll explore the world of gluten-free half moon cookies, from their history to how you can make them at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Half Moon Cookies</h2>
    <p>Half moon cookies, also known as black and white cookies, originated in the early 20th century in New York. They are characterized by their soft, cake-like texture and their iconic frosting—half chocolate and half vanilla. The cookies quickly became a staple in New York delis and bakeries, and their popularity spread across the country. Today, they are a nostalgic treat for many, evoking memories of childhood and family gatherings.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it's commonly used in baking to provide structure and elasticity to dough. However, with the advent of gluten-free flours and baking techniques, it's now possible to recreate many traditional baked goods, including half moon cookies, without gluten.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Half Moon Cookies</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free half moon cookies is a straightforward process, but it requires attention to detail to ensure the cookies turn out soft and cake-like. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, until a smooth batter forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and frost:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool completely before frosting. Spread half of each cookie with vanilla frosting and the other half with chocolate frosting.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Half Moon Cookies</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free half moon cookies turn out perfectly, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t skip the xanthan gum:</strong> Xanthan gum is essential for providing structure and elasticity in gluten-free baking. Without it, your cookies may crumble.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the cookies cool completely before frosting:</strong> If the cookies are still warm, the frosting will melt and slide off. Patience is key!</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with frosting:</strong> If you’re feeling adventurous, try adding flavors like lemon or almond extract to the vanilla frosting for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>
