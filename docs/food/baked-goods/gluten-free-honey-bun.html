    <h1>Gluten-Free Honey Buns: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and for good reason. Whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply a desire for a healthier lifestyle, more people are turning to gluten-free alternatives. Among these, gluten-free honey buns have emerged as a delightful treat that combines the sweetness of honey with the comfort of a soft, fluffy bun.

They are often lower in refined sugars and higher in fiber, making them a more nutritious choice compared to their traditional counterparts.</p>
