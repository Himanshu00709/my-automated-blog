    <h1>Gluten-Free Viennese Whirls: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Viennese whirls are a classic British biscuit, known for their delicate, buttery texture and elegant swirl design. Traditionally made with wheat flour, these treats can be a challenge for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. However, with the rise of gluten-free baking, it's now possible to enjoy these delightful pastries without compromising on taste or texture. In this blog post, we'll explore the world of gluten-free Viennese whirls, from their history to a step-by-step recipe, and answer some common questions about gluten-free baking.</p>

    <h2>The History of Viennese Whirls</h2>

    <p>Viennese whirls have their origins in Austria, where they were first created as a delicate, melt-in-the-mouth biscuit. The recipe was later adapted in the UK, where it became a popular teatime treat. The biscuits are typically made with a rich, buttery dough that is piped into swirls and baked until golden. They are often sandwiched together with jam and buttercream, creating a perfect balance of sweetness and texture.</p>

    <p>For those who need to avoid gluten, the traditional recipe poses a problem due to the use of wheat flour. However, with the availability of high-quality gluten-free flours, it's now possible to recreate these biscuits with the same light, crumbly texture that makes them so irresistible.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 180°C (160°C fan) and lining two baking trays with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter and icing sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract and mix well. Gradually add the gluten-free flour blend and cornflour, mixing until a smooth dough forms. The dough should be soft but not sticky.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Pipe the Swirls</h3>

    <p>Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a large star nozzle. Pipe small swirls onto the prepared baking trays, leaving enough space between each swirl to allow for spreading during baking. If you don't have a piping bag, you can use a spoon to drop small mounds of dough onto the trays, though the swirls won't be as defined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Whirls</h3>

    <p>Bake the whirls in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until they are lightly golden around the edges. Be careful not to overbake, as gluten-free baked goods can dry out quickly. Once baked, remove the whirls from the oven and allow them to cool on the trays for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Whirls</h3>

    <p>Once the whirls are completely cool, spread a small amount of raspberry jam on the flat side of one whirl. If desired, pipe a small amount of buttercream on top of the jam. Sandwich with another whirl, pressing gently to secure. Repeat with the remaining whirls.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Viennese Whirls</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking can be a bit tricky, but with a few tips, you can achieve perfect Viennese whirls every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right balance of starches and proteins to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough biscuits. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough if necessary:</strong> If the dough is too soft to pipe, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before piping.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch the baking time:</strong> Gluten-free baked goods can go from perfectly baked to overbaked very quickly. Keep a close eye on the whirls as they bake.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Viennese Whirls</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of jam?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any type of jam you like. Strawberry, apricot, or even a tangy lemon curd would work well in place of raspberry jam.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these whirls dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as margarine or coconut oil. Just make sure to use a brand that is suitable for baking.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free Viennese whirls?</h3>
        <p>Store the whirls in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. If you need to store them longer, you can freeze them for up to a month. Just make sure to thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these whirls ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make the whirls a day or two in advance. Store them in an airtight container and assemble them with jam and buttercream just before serving.</p>
