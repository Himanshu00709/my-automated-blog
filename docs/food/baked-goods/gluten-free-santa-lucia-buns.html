    <h1>Gluten-Free Santa Lucia Buns: A Delicious Tradition Reimagined</h1>
    <p>Santa Lucia buns, or "Lussekatter," are a cherished part of Scandinavian holiday traditions, particularly in Sweden. These saffron-infused buns, shaped into an "S" or a curled cat, are traditionally enjoyed on December 13th, the feast day of Saint Lucia. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying these festive treats can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free Santa Lucia buns—a delightful reimagining of this classic recipe that allows everyone to partake in the holiday joy.</p>

    <h2>The History of Santa Lucia Buns</h2>
    <p>The tradition of Santa Lucia buns dates back to the 18th century in Sweden. The buns are named after Saint Lucia, a Christian martyr who is celebrated for her kindness and light during the darkest time of the year. The saffron used in the buns symbolizes light and wealth, making them a perfect representation of the holiday spirit. Over the years, the recipe has evolved, but the essence of the tradition remains the same.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not only for those with celiac disease but also for individuals with gluten sensitivity or those seeking a healthier lifestyle. Traditional Santa Lucia buns are made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. By substituting gluten-free flour, we can create a version of these buns that is just as delicious and festive, without the adverse effects of gluten.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free Santa Lucia buns:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Activate the Yeast:</strong> Warm the milk to about 37°C (98°F) and dissolve the yeast in it. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li><strong>Infuse the Saffron:</strong> Crush the saffron threads and mix them with a tablespoon of warm milk. Let it steep for a few minutes to release its color and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum, sugar, and salt. Add the yeast mixture, saffron-infused milk, melted butter, and eggs. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth. Gluten-free dough may be stickier than traditional dough, so don't worry if it feels different.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it Rise:</strong> Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Buns:</strong> Divide the dough into 12 equal portions. Roll each portion into a rope and shape it into an "S" or a curled cat. Place the shaped buns on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Raisins:</strong> If using raisins, press one into the center of each curl of the "S" or at the ends of the cat shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Rise:</strong> Cover the buns with a kitchen towel and let them rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 200°C (392°F). Brush the buns with a beaten egg for a golden finish. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Let the buns cool on a wire rack before serving. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or glögg (mulled wine) for a truly Scandinavian experience.</li>
    </ol>
