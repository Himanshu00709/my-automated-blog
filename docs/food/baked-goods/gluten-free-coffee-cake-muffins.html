    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free coffee cake muffins is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a batch of delicious muffins:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with butter or cooking spray.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Alternately add the dry ingredients and the yogurt to the butter mixture, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</p>

    <h3>6. Add Milk</h3>
    <p>Stir in the milk until the batter is smooth and well combined. The batter should be thick but pourable.</p>

    <h3>7. Prepare Streusel Topping</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the gluten-free flour, sugar, cinnamon, and softened butter until crumbly. This will be your streusel topping.</p>

    <h3>8. Fill Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full. Sprinkle the streusel topping evenly over the batter.</p>

    <h3>9. Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>10. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as oat flour or rice flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a non-dairy yogurt and milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or fruit to the batter?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add chopped nuts, such as walnuts or pecans, or even fresh or dried fruit like blueberries or raisins for added texture and flavor.</p>
