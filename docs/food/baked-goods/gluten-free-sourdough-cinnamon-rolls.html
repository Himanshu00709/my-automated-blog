    <h1>Gluten-Free Sourdough Cinnamon Rolls: A Delicious Twist on a Classic</h1>
    <p>There’s something undeniably comforting about the aroma of freshly baked cinnamon rolls wafting through the kitchen. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, however, the thought of indulging in this classic treat can feel like a distant dream. Enter gluten-free sourdough cinnamon rolls—a delightful fusion of tangy sourdough and sweet, spiced cinnamon. In this article, we’ll explore the art of making these rolls, their health benefits, and why they’re a must-try for anyone, gluten-free or not.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Sourdough Cinnamon Rolls?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has come a long way, and sourdough is a game-changer. Traditional sourdough fermentation breaks down gluten, making it easier to digest for some individuals. When combined with gluten-free flours, sourdough adds depth of flavor and a soft, airy texture that’s often missing in gluten-free baked goods. Cinnamon rolls, with their rich, gooey filling and tender dough, are the perfect canvas for this technique.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2>
    <p>Before diving into the recipe, let’s take a look at the key ingredients that make these cinnamon rolls so special:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Plant-based milk</td>
                <td>Keeps the dough moist and tender</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by combining your gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl. Add your active sourdough starter, plant-based milk, and a touch of sweetener. Mix until a soft dough forms. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let it rest at room temperature for 6-8 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is resting, prepare the cinnamon filling. In a small bowl, mix together coconut sugar, cinnamon, and softened vegan butter or coconut oil. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Roll and Fill</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, roll it out on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle. Spread the cinnamon filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Roll the dough tightly into a log, starting from the longer side.</p>

    <h3>4. Cut and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a sharp knife, cut the log into 12 equal slices. Place the slices in a greased baking dish, leaving a little space between each roll. Cover the dish and let the rolls rise for another 1-2 hours. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.</p>

    <h3>5. Add the Glaze</h3>
    <p>While the rolls are baking, prepare a simple glaze by whisking together powdered sugar, plant-based milk, and a splash of vanilla extract. Drizzle the glaze over the warm rolls before serving.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Sourdough</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free sourdough cinnamon rolls aren’t just delicious—they’re also packed with health benefits. The fermentation process breaks down phytic acid, making nutrients more bioavailable. Additionally, sourdough is easier on the digestive system, even for those without gluten sensitivities. The use of natural sweeteners and plant-based ingredients also makes these rolls a healthier alternative to traditional recipes.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a store-bought gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a store-bought blend, but make sure it contains xanthan gum or add it separately to ensure the dough binds properly.</p>

        <h3>How do I maintain a gluten-free sourdough starter?</h3>
        <p>Feed your starter with gluten-free flour and water regularly. Keep it at room temperature if you bake often, or store it in the fridge for weekly feedings.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these rolls ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Prepare the rolls up to the baking stage, then cover and refrigerate overnight. Bake them fresh in the morning for a warm, gooey treat.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free sourdough cinnamon rolls are a testament to how far gluten-free baking has come. With their tangy, tender dough and sweet, spiced filling, they’re a treat that everyone can enjoy. Whether you’re gluten-free by necessity or simply looking to try something new, these rolls are sure to become a favorite in your kitchen.
