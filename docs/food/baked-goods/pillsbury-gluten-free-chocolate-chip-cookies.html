    <p>As you can see, these cookies are relatively low in calories and fat, making them a reasonable treat when enjoyed in moderation. However, like any dessert, they should be consumed as part of a balanced diet.</p>

    <h2>How Do They Compare to Traditional Chocolate Chip Cookies?</h2>

    <p>When it comes to taste and texture, Pillsbury Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies hold their own against traditional cookies. The primary difference lies in the flour used. Traditional cookies are made with wheat flour, which contains gluten, while Pillsbury’s gluten-free version uses a blend of gluten-free flours. Despite this difference, the cookies maintain a soft and chewy texture that is very similar to their gluten-containing counterparts.</p>

    <p>In terms of flavor, the gluten-free cookies are just as rich and satisfying. The chocolate chips are evenly distributed throughout the dough, ensuring that every bite is packed with chocolatey goodness. Some people may notice a slight difference in taste due to the absence of wheat flour, but overall, the cookies are a delicious alternative that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions.</p>
