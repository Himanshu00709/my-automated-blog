    <h1>Gluten-Free Pecan Sandies: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular over the years, and for good reason. Whether you have celiac disease, a gluten intolerance, or simply want to explore healthier baking options, gluten-free recipes offer a world of possibilities. One such delightful treat is the gluten-free pecan sandie. These buttery, crumbly cookies are not only delicious but also easy to make, making them a perfect addition to your dessert repertoire.</p>

    <h2>What Are Pecan Sandies?</h2>
    <p>Pecan sandies are a classic cookie that originated in the southern United States. They are known for their rich, buttery flavor and the delightful crunch of pecans. Traditionally, these cookies are made with wheat flour, but with a few simple substitutions, you can create a gluten-free version that is just as tasty, if not more so.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe digestive issues and other health problems for those who are intolerant. However, even if you don't have a gluten-related condition, opting for gluten-free baked goods can be a healthier choice. Gluten-free flours often contain more fiber and nutrients than traditional wheat flour, and they can help reduce inflammation in the body.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free pecan sandies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the Butter and Sugars:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Vanilla Extract:</strong> Mix in the vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, salt, and baking powder.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Pecans:</strong> Gently fold in the chopped pecans until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Cookies:</strong> Scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of dough and roll them into balls. Place them on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pecan Sandies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free pecan sandies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too soft, chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before shaping and baking. This will help the cookies hold their shape better.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast the Pecans:</strong> For an extra layer of flavor, toast the pecans before adding them to the dough. Simply spread them on a baking sheet and bake at 350째F (175째C) for 5-7 minutes, or until fragrant.</li>
    </ul>
