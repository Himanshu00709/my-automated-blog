    <h1>Gluten-Free King Cake in New Orleans: A Mardi Gras Delight</h1>
    <p>Mardi Gras in New Orleans is synonymous with vibrant parades, colorful beads, and, of course, the iconic King Cake.

A small plastic baby, representing the baby Jesus, is hidden inside the cake, and the person who finds it is said to have good luck and is often tasked with hosting the next King Cake party.</p>
