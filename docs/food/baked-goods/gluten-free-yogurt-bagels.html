<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Yogurt Bagels</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Are gluten-free yogurt bagels suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>Traditional gluten-free yogurt bagels are not vegan because they contain Greek yogurt, which is a dairy product. However, you can make a vegan version by using a plant-based yogurt, such as almond or coconut yogurt, and substituting the egg wash with a non-dairy milk wash.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I freeze gluten-free yogurt bagels?</h3>
    <p>Yes, gluten-free yogurt bagels freeze well. Once baked and cooled, place them in an airtight container or freezer bag and store them in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply toast them straight from the freezer or let them thaw at room temperature.</p>

    <h3>3. What can I use instead of Greek yogurt?</h3>
    <p>If you don't have Greek yogurt on hand, you can use regular plain yogurt, but keep in mind that the texture may be slightly different. Alternatively, you can use a dairy-free yogurt for a vegan option.</p>

    <h3>4. Are gluten-free yogurt bagels low-carb?</h3>
    <p>While gluten-free yogurt bagels are lower in carbs compared to traditional bagels, they are not considered low-carb. The exact carb content will depend on the type of gluten-free flour used. For a lower-carb option, consider using almond flour or coconut flour.</p>

    <h3>5. Can I add flavors to the dough?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can customize your gluten-free yogurt bagels by adding flavors to the dough. Consider mixing in cinnamon and raisins for a sweet version, or garlic and herbs for a savory twist.</p>
</div>

With their high protein content, probiotic benefits, and versatility, these bagels are sure to become a staple in your kitchen. Whether you buy them from a store or make them at home, gluten-free yogurt bagels are a tasty way to start your day or satisfy your cravings without compromising on flavor or health.
