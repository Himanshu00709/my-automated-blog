    <h1>Gluten-Free Black and White Cookies: A Delicious Treat for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Black and white cookies are a classic treat that has been enjoyed for generations. With their distinctive half-and-half frosting and soft, cake-like texture, they are a favorite among cookie lovers. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying these cookies can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free black and white cookies—a delightful alternative that allows everyone to indulge in this timeless treat. In this blog post, we’ll explore the history of black and white cookies, the benefits of going gluten-free, and provide a detailed recipe to make your own gluten-free version at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Black and White Cookies</h2>

    <p>Black and white cookies, also known as "half-moon cookies," have a rich history that dates back to the early 20th century. Originating in New York City, these cookies quickly became a staple in bakeries across the city. The cookie's unique design—half chocolate and half vanilla frosting—was inspired by the city's diverse culture, symbolizing unity and harmony. Over the years, the popularity of black and white cookies has spread far beyond New York, becoming a beloved treat across the United States.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained significant attention in recent years, and for good reason.

Symptoms can range from digestive issues to skin rashes and even neurological problems. By opting for gluten-free alternatives, individuals can enjoy their favorite foods without the discomfort or health risks associated with gluten consumption.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free baking has come a long way, with many recipes now offering the same taste and texture as their gluten-containing counterparts. Gluten-free black and white cookies are a perfect example of how you can enjoy a classic treat without compromising on flavor or quality.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and Bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Frosting:</strong> In a small bowl, mix the powdered sugar with enough water to create a thick but spreadable icing. Divide the icing into two bowls. Add cocoa powder to one bowl and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Frost the Cookies:</strong> Spread the vanilla icing on one half of each cookie and the chocolate icing on the other half. Allow the frosting to set before serving.</li>
    </ol>
