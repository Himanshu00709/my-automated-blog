    <h2>Tips for Baking Perfect Gluten-Free Birthday Cookies</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with the right techniques, you can achieve perfect results every time. Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Measure Accurately:</strong> Gluten-free flours can behave differently than wheat flour, so precise measurements are essential.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Gluten-free dough can be stickier, so chilling it before baking helps prevent spreading.</li>

        <li><strong>Use Parchment Paper:</strong> This prevents sticking and makes cleanup easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free baking opens up a world of flavor possibilities. Try adding nuts, dried fruits, or chocolate chips for extra flair.</li>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Birthday Cookies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>No, regular flour contains gluten, which is not suitable for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Always use a gluten-free flour blend or alternative flours like almond or coconut flour.</p>

        <h3>2. Are gluten-free cookies healthier?</h3>
        <p>Not necessarily. While gluten-free cookies are essential for those with dietary restrictions, they can still be high in sugar and calories. It’s important to enjoy them in moderation as part of a balanced diet.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I freeze gluten-free cookie dough?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free cookie dough can be frozen for up to 3 months. Simply shape the dough into balls, place them on a baking sheet, and freeze. Once frozen, transfer the dough balls to a freezer bag. When ready to bake, you can bake them directly from frozen, adding a few extra minutes to the baking time.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I prevent gluten-free cookies from being too dry?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free flours tend to absorb more moisture, so it’s important to add enough liquid to the dough. You can also try adding ingredients like applesauce, yogurt, or extra butter to keep the cookies moist.</p>
    </div>
