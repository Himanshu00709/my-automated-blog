<h1>Gluten-Free Biscochitos in Albuquerque: A Delicious Tradition</h1>

<p>Biscochitos, the official state cookie of New Mexico, are a beloved treat that holds a special place in the hearts of locals and visitors alike. These anise and cinnamon-flavored cookies are traditionally made with wheat flour, but with the rise of gluten-free diets, many bakeries in Albuquerque have started offering gluten-free versions of this iconic cookie. In this blog post, we’ll explore the history of biscochitos, the rise of gluten-free options, and where you can find the best gluten-free biscochitos in Albuquerque.</p>

<h2>The History of Biscochitos</h2>

<p>Biscochitos have a rich history that dates back to the Spanish colonization of New Mexico in the 16th century. The cookies are believed to have been inspired by traditional Spanish shortbread cookies, but over time, they evolved into a unique New Mexican delicacy. The name "biscochito" is derived from the Spanish word "bizcocho," which means biscuit or cake. These cookies are traditionally made with lard, sugar, flour, anise, and cinnamon, giving them a distinctive flavor and texture.</p>

<p>Biscochitos are often associated with celebrations and special occasions, such as weddings, baptisms, and holidays like Christmas and Easter. They are also a staple at local fiestas and community gatherings. In 1989, biscochitos were designated as the official state cookie of New Mexico, cementing their status as a cultural icon.</p>

<h2>The Rise of Gluten-Free Biscochitos</h2>

<p>With the increasing awareness of gluten intolerance and celiac disease, many people have had to eliminate gluten from their diets. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause severe health issues for those with gluten-related disorders. As a result, there has been a growing demand for gluten-free versions of traditional foods, including biscochitos.</p>

<p>In Albuquerque, several bakeries and restaurants have risen to the challenge of creating gluten-free biscochitos that retain the traditional flavor and texture of the original cookies. These gluten-free versions are typically made with alternative flours, such as almond flour, rice flour, or a gluten-free flour blend. While the ingredients may differ, the goal is to create a cookie that is just as delicious and satisfying as the traditional version.</p>
