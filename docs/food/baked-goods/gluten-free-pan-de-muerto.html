    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Pan de Muerto</h2>

    <p>Creating gluten-free Pan de Muerto involves a few extra steps compared to traditional recipes, but the result is equally delicious. Here’s a simplified guide:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Combine gluten-free flour, xanthan gum, sugar, yeast, and salt in a mixing bowl. Add softened butter, eggs, orange zest, and warm milk (or a dairy-free alternative). Mix until a soft dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>Let It Rise:</strong> Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Bread:</strong> Divide the dough into portions for the main loaf and the bone-shaped decorations. Shape the loaf into a round ball and attach the bone-shaped pieces on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the bread for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
