    <h1>Gluten-Free Honey Buns: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by both health-conscious consumers and those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Honey Buns?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free honey buns are a variation of the classic honey bun, a sweet pastry that is typically made with wheat flour, sugar, and honey. The gluten-free version replaces wheat flour with alternative flours such as almond flour, rice flour, or a gluten-free flour blend. These buns are often filled with a sweet cinnamon-sugar mixture and topped with a honey glaze, making them a perfect treat for breakfast, dessert, or a snack.</p>

        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Gluten-free honey buns can be made with a variety of alternative flours, allowing for customization based on dietary preferences or allergies.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich:</strong> Many gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, are rich in nutrients like protein, fiber, and healthy fats, making these buns a more nutritious option compared to traditional honey buns.</li>
