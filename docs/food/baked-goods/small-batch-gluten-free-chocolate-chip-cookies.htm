    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This ensures your cookies won’t stick and makes cleanup a breeze.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until a dough forms. Fold in the chocolate chips.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may look slightly underbaked, but they’ll firm up as they cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy warm with a glass of milk or store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If you have time, chilling the dough for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to add nuts, dried fruit, or even a sprinkle of sea salt on top for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Simply substitute the butter with coconut oil or a dairy-free butter alternative. Ensure your chocolate chips are also dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How do I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the baked cookies for up to 2 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I double the recipe?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you need more cookies, simply double the ingredients. Just be sure to bake in batches to avoid overcrowding the baking sheet.</p>

        <h3>Why do my cookies spread too much?</h3>
        <p>If your cookies spread too much, it could be due to the butter being too soft or the dough not being chilled. Try chilling the dough before baking to help the cookies hold their shape.</p>
