    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free Cosmic Brownies:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, and a pinch of salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, mix the melted butter and sugar until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Brownies</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Sprinkle the rainbow candy-coated chocolates on top. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan before lifting them out using the parchment paper overhang. Cut into squares and serve.</p>
