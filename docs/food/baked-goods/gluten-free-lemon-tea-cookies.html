    <p>Making gluten-free lemon tea cookies is easier than you might think. With just a few simple ingredients and some basic baking skills, you can create a batch of these delightful treats in no time. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups gluten-free flour (such as almond flour or a gluten-free all-purpose blend)</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>¾ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the egg, lemon zest, and lemon juice to the butter mixture, and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Lemon Tea Cookies</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free lemon tea cookies turn out perfectly every time, here are some helpful tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Lemon:</strong> Fresh lemon zest and juice will give your cookies the best flavor. Avoid using bottled lemon juice, as it can have a bitter taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too soft, chilling it for 15-20 minutes before baking can help the cookies hold their shape better.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flours:</strong> Different gluten-free flours can yield slightly different textures. Feel free to experiment with almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose blend to find your favorite.</li>
