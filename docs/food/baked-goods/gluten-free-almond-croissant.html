    <h1>Gluten-Free Almond Croissant: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>For those who love the buttery, flaky goodness of a traditional croissant but need to avoid gluten, the gluten-free almond croissant is a game-changer. This delightful pastry combines the rich flavors of almond filling with the light, airy texture of a croissant, all without the gluten. Whether you're gluten-intolerant, celiac, or simply looking to reduce gluten in your diet, this treat is a must-try. In this article, we'll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free almond croissants, from their ingredients and preparation to their health benefits and where to find them.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Croissant Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Traditional croissants are made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. Gluten is a protein that gives dough its elasticity and helps it rise. However, for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues. To make a gluten-free croissant, bakers substitute wheat flour with gluten-free alternatives such as almond flour, rice flour, or a blend of gluten-free flours. These alternatives mimic the texture and taste of traditional croissants while being safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in a Gluten-Free Almond Croissant</h2>
