Choc chip gluten-free muffins, in particular, offer the perfect balance of indulgence and nutrition.</p>

<h2>Ingredients for Perfect Choc Chip Gluten-Free Muffins</h2>

<h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create perfect choc chip gluten-free muffins:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, and a pinch of salt.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk, melted butter (or coconut oil), and sugar. Mix until well combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Chocolate Chips:</strong> Fold in the chocolate chips, reserving a handful to sprinkle on top of the muffins before baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Fill the Muffin Tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Muffins</h2>

<p>Gluten-free baking can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll achieve muffin perfection every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a Reliable Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a high-quality blend that’s specifically designed for baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense muffins. Mix until just combined to keep them light and fluffy.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Moisture:</strong> Gluten-free baked goods can dry out quickly. Adding ingredients like applesauce, yogurt, or extra eggs can help retain moisture.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free muffins may take slightly longer to bake. Keep an eye on them and test with a toothpick to ensure they’re fully cooked.</li>
</ul>
