    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making these delightful cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the egg and lime zest:</strong> Beat in the egg until fully incorporated. Then, add the key lime zest and juice, mixing until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the cookies:</strong> Scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of dough and roll them into balls. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers should still be soft.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and dust:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, dust the cookies with powdered sugar for an extra touch of sweetness.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Key Lime Cookies</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be sure to get perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking, as it will give you the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough if needed:</strong> If your dough is too sticky to handle, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before shaping the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Use fresh key limes:</strong> Fresh key limes will give you the best flavor. If you can’t find key limes, regular limes can be used as a substitute, but the flavor will be slightly different.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular limes instead of key limes?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular limes if key limes are not available. However, keep in mind that key limes have a more intense and slightly sweeter flavor, so the taste of your cookies may vary slightly.</p>
