    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free white chocolate macadamia cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugars:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Egg and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in White Chocolate and Macadamia Nuts:</strong> Gently fold in the white chocolate chips and chopped macadamia nuts.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and Bake:</strong> Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking and includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined to ensure a tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too soft, chilling it for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch the Baking Time:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can go from underbaked to overbaked quickly. Keep a close eye on them, especially during the last few minutes of baking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the cookies to be gluten-free. However, the texture and taste may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute the white chocolate with dark chocolate?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer dark chocolate, feel free to substitute it for the white chocolate. The cookies will have a richer, more intense flavor.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use other nuts instead of macadamia nuts?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other nuts like almonds, pecans, or walnuts if you prefer. Just make sure to chop them into similar-sized pieces for even distribution.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
