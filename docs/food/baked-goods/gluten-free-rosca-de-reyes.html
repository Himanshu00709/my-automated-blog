    <h1>Gluten-Free Rosca de Reyes: A Delicious Tradition for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Rosca de Reyes, or King's Cake, is a beloved tradition in many Latin American and Spanish-speaking cultures, celebrated on January 6th during the Feast of the Epiphany. This sweet, circular bread is adorned with candied fruits and often hides a small figurine inside, symbolizing the baby Jesus. For those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying this festive treat can be a challenge. However, with the rise of gluten-free baking, it's now possible to savor a delicious, gluten-free Rosca de Reyes without compromising on taste or tradition.</p>

    <h2>What is Rosca de Reyes?</h2>
    <p>Rosca de Reyes is a rich, sweet bread that is traditionally enjoyed on Three Kings' Day, also known as Día de los Reyes Magos. The bread is shaped into a circle or oval to symbolize a crown, and it is often decorated with colorful candied fruits to represent the jewels of the crown. Inside the bread, a small figurine of baby Jesus is hidden, and whoever finds it is said to have good luck and is often tasked with hosting a party on Candlemas Day (Día de la Candelaria) on February 2nd.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of health issues, from digestive discomfort to more severe autoimmune reactions. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it is a common ingredient in traditional Rosca de Reyes recipes. By opting for a gluten-free version, those with dietary restrictions can still partake in this cherished tradition without compromising their health.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your own gluten-free Rosca de Reyes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Activate the Yeast:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the warm milk and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, sugar, and softened butter. Add the activated yeast mixture and eggs, then mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>First Rise:</strong> Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Rosca:</strong> Once the dough has risen, punch it down and shape it into a large circle or oval on a baking sheet. If desired, hide the figurine inside the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Rise:</strong> Cover the shaped dough and let it rise again for about 30-45 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Decorate:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Brush the dough with an egg wash and decorate with candied fruits.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the Rosca de Reyes for 25-30 minutes, or until it is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the bread to cool before slicing and serving. Enjoy with a cup of hot chocolate or coffee!</li>
