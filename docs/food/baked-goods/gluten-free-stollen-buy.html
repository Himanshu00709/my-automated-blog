    <h1>Gluten-Free Stollen: A Delicious Holiday Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Stollen, a traditional German fruit bread, is a beloved holiday treat that has been enjoyed for centuries. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this festive delicacy can be a challenge. Fortunately, gluten-free stollen has emerged as a delightful alternative, allowing everyone to partake in the joy of this seasonal favorite. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free stollen, from its history to where you can buy it, and why it’s a must-try this holiday season.</p>

    <h2>The History of Stollen</h2>
    <p>Stollen, also known as Christstollen, has a rich history dating back to the 14th century in Dresden, Germany. Originally, it was a simple bread made with flour, water, and oats, but over time, it evolved into a richer, sweeter treat filled with dried fruits, nuts, and spices. The shape of the stollen, with its folded ends, is said to represent the swaddled baby Jesus, making it a symbolic food during the Christmas season.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, stollen contains wheat flour, which makes it off-limits for those avoiding gluten. However, with the rise of gluten-free baking, modern bakers have found ways to recreate this classic treat using alternative flours like almond, rice, or tapioca flour. The result is a gluten-free stollen that is just as flavorful and festive as the original.</p>

        <li><strong>Unique Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free flours can add a unique texture and flavor profile to the stollen, making it a delightful variation on the classic recipe.</li>
