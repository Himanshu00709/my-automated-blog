    <h1>Gluten-Free Stollen: A Delicious Holiday Tradition</h1>
    <p>Stollen, a traditional German fruit bread, is a beloved treat during the holiday season. Its rich, buttery flavor, combined with dried fruits, nuts, and a dusting of powdered sugar, makes it a festive favorite. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic dessert can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free stollen—a delightful alternative that allows everyone to partake in this holiday tradition without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>What is Stollen?</h2>
    <p>Stollen, also known as Christstollen, is a fruit bread that originated in Germany during the 14th century. It is traditionally made with flour, yeast, water, butter, and a variety of dried fruits and nuts. The bread is often flavored with spices like cinnamon, cardamom, and nutmeg, and is typically dusted with powdered sugar to resemble the snow-covered landscape of winter.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Fortunately, with the rise of gluten-free baking, it's now possible to enjoy traditional recipes like stollen without the gluten.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Stollen</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free stollen is a labor of love, but the results are well worth the effort. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating your own gluten-free stollen:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, yeast, and sugar. Add the warm milk and softened butter, and mix until a dough begins to form. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. The dough should be soft and slightly sticky.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add Fruits and Nuts</h3>
    <p>Fold in the dried fruits, nuts, and spices. Mix until everything is evenly distributed throughout the dough. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Stollen</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour). Shape the dough into an oval loaf, then fold one side over the other, leaving a slight overlap. This traditional shape is symbolic of the baby Jesus wrapped in swaddling clothes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Stollen</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Place the shaped stollen on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the stollen is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Dust with Powdered Sugar</h3>
    <p>Allow the stollen to cool completely before dusting it generously with powdered sugar. This not only adds a festive touch but also enhances the flavor.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Stollen</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use any gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, but it's important to choose a blend that is specifically designed for baking. Some blends may contain xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten. If your blend doesn't include it, you may need to add it separately.</p>

        <h3>How long does gluten-free stollen last?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free stollen can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. For longer storage, you can wrap it tightly and freeze it for up to three months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make stollen without nuts?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you have a nut allergy or simply prefer not to use nuts, you can omit them from the recipe. The stollen will still be delicious with just the dried fruits.</p>

        <h3>Is gluten-free stollen suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Traditional stollen contains butter and eggs, but you can make a vegan version by substituting these ingredients with plant-based alternatives like vegan butter and flax eggs.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free stollen is a wonderful way to enjoy a classic holiday treat without the worry of gluten. With the right ingredients and a bit of patience, you can create a stollen that is just as delicious and festive as the traditional version. Whether you're baking for yourself or sharing with loved ones, gluten-free stollen is sure to bring joy to your holiday table. So, roll up your sleeves, gather your ingredients, and get ready to bake a gluten-free stollen that will become a new holiday tradition in your home.</p>
