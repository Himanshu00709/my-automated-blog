    <h1>Gluten-Free Greek Cookies: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>Greek cuisine is renowned for its rich flavors, fresh ingredients, and timeless recipes. Among the many delightful treats that Greece has to offer, Greek cookies hold a special place. These cookies, often enjoyed with a cup of coffee or as a dessert, are a staple in Greek households. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, traditional Greek cookies can be off-limits due to their wheat-based ingredients. Fortunately, gluten-free Greek cookies are not only possible but also incredibly delicious and healthy. In this blog post, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free Greek cookies, their history, popular varieties, and how you can make them at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Greek Cookies</h2>

    <p>Greek cookies have a long and storied history, dating back to ancient times. The Greeks have always had a sweet tooth, and their cookies were often made with honey, nuts, and sesame seeds. These ingredients were not only delicious but also nutritious, providing energy and sustenance. Over the centuries, Greek cookies have evolved, incorporating new ingredients and techniques, but they have always remained a beloved part of Greek culture.</p>

    <p>With the rise of gluten-free diets in recent years, many traditional Greek cookie recipes have been adapted to exclude gluten. This has allowed people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity to enjoy these delightful treats without compromising their health. Gluten-free Greek cookies are made with alternative flours such as almond flour, rice flour, or chickpea flour, which provide a similar texture and flavor to traditional wheat flour.</p>

    <h2>Popular Varieties of Gluten-Free Greek Cookies</h2>
