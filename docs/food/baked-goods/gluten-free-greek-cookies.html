    <h1>Gluten-Free Greek Cookies: A Delicious Journey</h1>
    <p>Greek cuisine is renowned for its rich flavors, vibrant ingredients, and centuries-old traditions. Among its many culinary treasures, Greek cookies hold a special place. These sweet treats are often enjoyed during festive occasions, family gatherings, or simply as a delightful snack. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, indulging in traditional Greek cookies can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free Greek cookiesâ€”a delicious alternative that allows everyone to savor the flavors of Greece without compromising on health or taste.</p>

    <h2>The History of Greek Cookies</h2>
    <p>Greek cookies, or "koulourakia," have a long and storied history. These cookies are often associated with religious holidays, particularly Easter and Christmas, but they are also enjoyed year-round. Traditionally, Greek cookies are made with wheat flour, butter, sugar, and eggs, and are often flavored with vanilla, orange zest, or sesame seeds. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets, bakers have adapted these recipes to cater to those who cannot tolerate gluten.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe digestive issues, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term health complications. Even for those without celiac disease, gluten sensitivity can cause discomfort, bloating, and fatigue. By opting for gluten-free Greek cookies, you can enjoy the same delicious flavors without the adverse effects of gluten.</p>
