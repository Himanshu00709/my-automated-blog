    <h1>Gluten-Free Stuffed Cookies: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>In recent years, gluten-free diets have gained immense popularity, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among health-conscious individuals. One of the most delightful ways to enjoy gluten-free baking is through stuffed cookies. These cookies are not only free from gluten but also packed with flavor, making them a perfect treat for everyone. In this blog post, we will explore the world of gluten-free stuffed cookies, from their benefits to recipes and tips for making them at home.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Stuffed Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free stuffed cookies are a variation of traditional cookies where the dough is made without gluten-containing ingredients like wheat, barley, or rye. Instead, gluten-free flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or rice flour are used. The "stuffed" aspect comes from the addition of a filling inside the cookie, which can range from chocolate and caramel to fruit preserves or nut butter. These cookies are a perfect blend of texture and flavor, offering a satisfying treat without the gluten.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Stuffed Cookies</h2>
    <p>There are several reasons why gluten-free stuffed cookies are a great choice:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthier Option:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, gluten-free cookies are a safe and delicious alternative. They help avoid the adverse health effects associated with gluten consumption.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich in Nutrients:</strong> Many gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, are rich in protein, healthy fats, and fiber, making these cookies more nutritious than their traditional counterparts.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> Gluten-free stuffed cookies can be customized with various fillings and flavors, catering to different dietary preferences and tastes.</li>
        <li><strong>Digestive Comfort:</strong> For those who experience bloating or digestive discomfort after consuming gluten, these cookies offer a comfortable and enjoyable treat.</li>
    </ul>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Take a small portion of the dough and flatten it in your hand. Place a teaspoon of your chosen filling in the center, then fold the dough over to encase the filling completely.</li>
        <li>Place the stuffed cookies on the prepared baking sheet, leaving enough space between them to allow for spreading.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Stuffed Cookies</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free stuffed cookies turn out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. A blend of flours, such as almond flour and rice flour, often yields the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky, chilling it for 30 minutes can make it easier to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Fillings:</strong> Don’t be afraid to get creative with your fillings. From dark chocolate to peanut butter or even fruit preserves, the possibilities are endless.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
