    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and xanthan gum. In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm milk and let it sit for 5 minutes until frothy. Add the sugar, melted butter, and egg to the yeast mixture, then gradually mix in the flour until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-7 minutes until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a food processor, grind the poppy seeds until fine. Mix the ground poppy seeds with honey, chopped nuts, and dried fruits (if using) until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Roll:</strong> Roll out the dough into a rectangle on a piece of parchment paper. Spread the poppy seed filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Carefully roll the dough into a log, starting from one of the longer sides. Seal the edges by pinching the dough together.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Transfer the rolled dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the roll is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the roll to cool completely before slicing. Serve as a dessert or snack, and enjoy!</li>
