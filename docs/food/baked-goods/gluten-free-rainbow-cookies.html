    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your own gluten-free rainbow cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, gluten-free flour blend, and sugar. Add the softened butter, eggs, and almond extract. Mix until a smooth dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Divide and Color:</strong> Divide the dough into three equal portions. Add green food coloring to one portion, red to another, and leave the third portion white. Mix each portion thoroughly until the color is evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer the Dough:</strong> Line a baking pan with parchment paper. Press the green dough evenly into the bottom of the pan. Repeat with the white and red dough, layering them on top of each other.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the layered dough for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow it to cool completely.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut and Coat:</strong> Once cooled, cut the baked dough into rectangular cookies. Dip each cookie into melted chocolate, coating the top and sides. Place them on a wire rack to set.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Rainbow Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some expert tips to ensure your gluten-free rainbow cookies turn out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Gel Food Coloring:</strong> Gel food coloring is more concentrated than liquid, so you’ll need less of it to achieve vibrant colors without altering the dough’s consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough becomes too soft while working with it, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes. This will make it easier to handle and layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Even Layers:</strong> Take your time to press each layer of dough evenly into the pan. This will ensure that your cookies have a uniform thickness and bake evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool Completely:</strong> Allow the baked dough to cool completely before cutting and coating with chocolate. This will prevent the chocolate from melting and ensure a smooth finish.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but make sure they include xanthan gum or another binding agent to help the dough hold together.</p>
