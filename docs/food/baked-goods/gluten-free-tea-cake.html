    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Tea Cake</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free tea cake is similar to baking a traditional tea cake, but with a few adjustments to ensure the best results. Follow these steps to create a moist and delicious gluten-free tea cake:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and prepare your baking pan by greasing it with butter or lining it with parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, sugar, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure they are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, melted butter or oil, milk, and vanilla extract. Make sure the wet ingredients are well combined before adding them to the dry ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Mix the Batter</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and serve with your favorite tea or coffee.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Tea Cake</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free tea cake turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Reliable Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that is specifically designed for baking cakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Xanthan Gum:</strong> Xanthan gum is essential for binding the ingredients together and giving the cake structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure Ingredients Accurately:</strong> Gluten-free baking requires precision. Use a kitchen scale to measure your ingredients for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can bake differently than traditional cakes. Use a toothpick to check if the cake is done.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Tea Cake</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, almond flour can be used, but it will result in a denser cake. For a lighter texture, it’s best to use a gluten-free flour blend that includes a mix of flours like rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil, and use a dairy-free milk such as almond milk or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How do I store gluten-free tea cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add fruits or nuts to the cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add fruits like blueberries, raspberries, or diced apples, as well as nuts like walnuts or almonds. Just make sure to fold them into the batter gently before baking.</p>
    </div>
