    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create perfect gluten-free iced oatmeal cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Fold in the gluten-free oats.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and bake:</strong> Use a cookie scoop or tablespoon to drop dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and glaze:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, drizzle with the glaze made from powdered sugar and milk.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Iced Oatmeal Cookies</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use certified gluten-free oats:</strong> Regular oats can be cross-contaminated with gluten, so always opt for certified gluten-free oats.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky, chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before scooping and baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the glaze consistency:</strong> If the glaze is too thick, add a bit more milk. If it’s too thin, add more powdered sugar.</li>
    </ul>
