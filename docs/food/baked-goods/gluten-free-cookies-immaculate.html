    <h2>Tips for Baking Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, especially if you're new to gluten-free baking. Here are some expert tips to ensure your cookies turn out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> A pre-made gluten-free flour blend is often the easiest option for beginners, as it mimics the texture of all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Binders:</strong> Gluten-free flours lack the binding properties of gluten, so adding ingredients like xanthan gum or psyllium husk can help hold the dough together.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Gluten-free cookie dough can be stickier than traditional dough. Chilling it for at least 30 minutes before baking will make it easier to handle and prevent spreading.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix the dough just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free cookies are a great canvas for experimenting with flavors. Add-ins like chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruit can elevate your cookies.</li>
    </ul>
