    <h1>Where to Buy Gluten-Free Soft Pretzels: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular over the years, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference. For those who love the chewy, salty goodness of soft pretzels but need to avoid gluten, finding a reliable source can be a challenge. Fortunately, the market for gluten-free products has expanded significantly, and gluten-free soft pretzels are now more accessible than ever.

Additionally, gluten-free pretzels are often lower in calories and higher in fiber, making them a healthier option for everyone.</p>
