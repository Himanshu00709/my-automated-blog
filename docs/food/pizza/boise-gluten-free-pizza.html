    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free pizza is more than just a trend; it's a necessity for many people. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe health issues for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Symptoms can range from digestive problems to skin rashes and even neurological issues. For these individuals, consuming gluten-free food is not a choice but a requirement for maintaining their health.</p>
    <p>However, gluten-free pizza doesn't have to be bland or boring. With the right ingredients and preparation, it can be just as delicious as traditional pizza. Boise's pizzerias have embraced this challenge, offering a variety of gluten-free crusts, toppings, and sauces that cater to all tastes.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. Here are some factors to consider when choosing a gluten-free pizza:</p>

    <h3>1. Crust Quality</h3>
    <p>The crust is the foundation of any pizza, and for gluten-free pizza, it's especially important. A good gluten-free crust should be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, without being too dense or crumbly. Many pizzerias in Boise use a blend of gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour, to achieve the perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>2. Toppings and Sauces</h3>
    <p>Toppings and sauces can make or break a pizza. When it comes to gluten-free pizza, it's essential to ensure that all toppings and sauces are also gluten-free. Some pizzerias in Boise offer a wide range of gluten-free toppings, including fresh vegetables, high-quality meats, and even vegan cheese options.</p>

    <h3>3. Cross-Contamination Prevention</h3>
    <p>Cross-contamination is a significant concern for those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance. Many pizzerias in Boise take extra precautions to prevent cross-contamination, such as using separate preparation areas, utensils, and ovens for gluten-free pizzas.</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Is gluten-free pizza healthier than regular pizza?</h3>
