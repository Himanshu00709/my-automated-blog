    <p>Switching to gluten-free pizza can have several health benefits, especially for those with gluten-related disorders. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Digestion:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea. Gluten-free pizza eliminates these problems, allowing for better digestion.</li>
