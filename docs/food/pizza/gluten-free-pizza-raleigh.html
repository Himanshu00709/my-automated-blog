<h2>Why Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular over the years, not just for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also for individuals looking to improve their overall health. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and other health problems for some people.

<p>In Raleigh, the gluten-free movement has taken off, with many establishments offering gluten-free pizza crusts made from alternative flours like rice, almond, or cauliflower. These crusts are not only safe for those with gluten intolerance but can also be just as delicious as traditional pizza crusts.</p>

<h2>What to Look for in a Gluten-Free Pizza Crust</h2>

<p>When choosing a gluten-free pizza, the crust is arguably the most important component. Here are some things to consider:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Look for crusts made from high-quality, gluten-free flours like rice, almond, or cauliflower. Avoid crusts that contain fillers or artificial ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong>Texture:</strong> A good gluten-free crust should have a texture that's similar to traditional pizza crust—crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.</li>
    <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> The crust should complement the toppings, not overpower them. Some gluten-free crusts have a distinct flavor, so choose one that you enjoy.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If you have celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, make sure the restaurant takes precautions to avoid cross-contamination. This includes using separate utensils, pans, and preparation areas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making Your Own Gluten-Free Pizza at Home</h2>

<p>If you're feeling adventurous, why not try making your own gluten-free pizza at home? Here's a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

<h3>Gluten-Free Pizza Crust Recipe</h3>

    <li>1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) active dry yeast</li>
    <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, salt, and sugar.</li>

    <li>Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 5 minutes, then let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Roll out the dough on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
