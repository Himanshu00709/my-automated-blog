<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Stuffed Crust Pizza</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free stuffed crust pizza at home is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create your own delicious pizza:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

<p>Start by mixing your gluten-free flour blend with xanthan gum, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Gradually add warm water and olive oil, mixing until a dough forms. Knead the dough gently until it’s smooth and elastic. Let it rest for about 30 minutes to allow the yeast to activate.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Roll Out the Dough</h3>

<p>Once the dough has rested, roll it out on a floured surface into a circle or rectangle, depending on your preference. Make sure the dough is thin enough to cook evenly but thick enough to hold the stuffing.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add the Cheese Filling</h3>

<p>Place a line of cheese (mozzarella works best) around the edge of the dough. Fold the edge over the cheese and press down to seal it, creating a stuffed crust. Make sure the seal is tight to prevent the cheese from leaking out during baking.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Toppings</h3>

<p>Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving the stuffed crust area clear. Add your favorite toppings, such as pepperoni, vegetables, or even more cheese. Be creative and customize your pizza to your liking.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake the Pizza</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Transfer the pizza to a baking sheet or pizza stone and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Stuffed Crust Pizza</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Gluten-Free:</strong> Safe for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</li>
