    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>

    <p>If you’re using a store-bought gluten-free pizza crust, follow the package instructions for pre-baking. If you’re making your own crust, mix your gluten-free flour blend with yeast, water, olive oil, and a pinch of salt. Knead the dough until smooth, then let it rise for about 30 minutes. Roll out the dough on a floured surface and transfer it to a pizza stone or baking sheet.</p>

    <h3>2. Add the Toppings</h3>

    <p>Start by brushing the crust with a thin layer of olive oil to prevent it from getting soggy. Next, spread the BBQ sauce evenly over the crust. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese on top, followed by the shredded chicken and sliced red onions. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.</p>

    <h3>3. Bake the Pizza</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C). Bake the pizza for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly. Keep an eye on it to ensure it doesn’t burn.</p>

    <h3>4. Garnish and Serve</h3>

    <p>Once the pizza is out of the oven, sprinkle it with fresh cilantro for a burst of flavor and color. Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free BBQ Chicken Pizza</h2>

    <p>This gluten-free BBQ chicken pizza is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. The chicken provides a lean source of protein, while the red onions add a dose of antioxidants and fiber. Using a gluten-free crust made from whole grains like quinoa or brown rice can also increase the fiber content, making this pizza a healthier option compared to traditional versions.</p>
