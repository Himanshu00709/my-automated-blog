    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>A great gluten-free pizza starts with the crust. Unlike traditional wheat-based crusts, gluten-free crusts are made from alternative flours such as rice, almond, or tapioca.

Fresh, high-quality ingredients can elevate a gluten-free pizza from good to exceptional. Many restaurants in Ann Arbor take pride in sourcing local and organic ingredients, ensuring that their gluten-free pizzas are not only safe but also delicious.</p>
