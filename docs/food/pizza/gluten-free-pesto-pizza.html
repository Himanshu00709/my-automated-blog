    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Pesto:</strong> In a food processor, combine the basil, garlic, pine nuts, and Parmesan cheese. Pulse until finely chopped. Gradually add the olive oil while the processor is running until the mixture becomes a smooth paste. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C). If you’re using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> Roll out your gluten-free pizza dough on a floured surface (use gluten-free flour) to your desired thickness. Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Pizza:</strong> Spread a generous layer of pesto over the crust. Top with sliced cherry tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. Feel free to add other toppings like grilled chicken, spinach, or olives.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong> Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (or onto the pizza stone) and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pesto Pizza</h2>

    <p>Creating the perfect gluten-free pesto pizza requires a bit of finesse. Here are some tips to ensure your pizza turns out delicious every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Crust:</strong> Not all gluten-free crusts are created equal. Look for one that is both flavorful and sturdy enough to hold your toppings.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overload the Toppings:</strong> Gluten-free crusts can be more delicate than traditional ones, so avoid overloading your pizza with too many toppings.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Bake the Crust:</strong> For a crispier crust, consider pre-baking it for 5-7 minutes before adding the toppings.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> While pesto, tomatoes, and mozzarella are classic, don’t be afraid to experiment with other toppings like roasted vegetables, prosciutto, or even a drizzle of balsamic glaze.</li>
    </ul>
