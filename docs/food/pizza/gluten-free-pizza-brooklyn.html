    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

    <p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. Here are some key factors that contribute to a great gluten-free pizza experience:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crust Quality:</strong> The crust should be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, without being too dense or crumbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> Fresh, high-quality toppings can make or break a pizza. Look for places that use locally sourced ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce:</strong> A well-balanced sauce that complements the crust and toppings is essential.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Whether it's mozzarella, ricotta, or a vegan alternative, the cheese should be flavorful and melt perfectly.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Digestion:</strong> Many people report better digestion and reduced bloating when they eliminate gluten from their diet.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich Ingredients:</strong> Gluten-free pizzas often use alternative flours like almond or chickpea flour, which can be more nutrient-dense than traditional wheat flour.</li>
