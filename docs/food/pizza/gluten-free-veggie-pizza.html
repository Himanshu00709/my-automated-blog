    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Veggie Pizza</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by mixing your gluten-free flour blend with yeast, salt, and a bit of sugar. Add warm water and olive oil, then knead the dough until it’s smooth. Let it rest for about 30 minutes to allow the yeast to activate and the dough to rise slightly.</p>

    <h3>2. Roll Out the Crust</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has rested, roll it out on a floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Aim for a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>3. Add the Sauce and Toppings</h3>
    <p>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the crust, leaving a small border around the edges. Next, add your favorite vegetables. Bell peppers, mushrooms, spinach, and onions are excellent choices. If you’re using cheese, sprinkle it evenly over the toppings.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Bake the pizza for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese (if used) is bubbly. Keep an eye on it to avoid overcooking.</p>
