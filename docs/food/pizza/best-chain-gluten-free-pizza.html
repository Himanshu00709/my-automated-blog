    <h2>What to Look for in a Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>

    <p>When choosing a gluten-free pizza, there are several factors to consider to ensure it meets your dietary needs and tastes great:</p>

    <h3>1. Crust Quality</h3>
    <p>The crust is the foundation of any pizza, and gluten-free crusts can vary widely in texture and flavor. Look for crusts made from high-quality ingredients like cauliflower, almond flour, or rice flour. These alternatives often provide a satisfying crunch or chewiness that rivals traditional wheat crusts.</p>

    <h3>2. Topping Variety</h3>
    <p>A great gluten-free pizza should offer a wide range of toppings to suit your preferences. Whether you’re a fan of classic pepperoni, vegetarian options, or gourmet combinations, the best chains provide plenty of choices to customize your pizza.</p>

    <h3>3. Cross-Contamination Prevention</h3>
    <p>For those with celiac disease, even trace amounts of gluten can cause a reaction. It’s essential to choose a pizza chain that takes cross-contamination seriously. Look for chains with dedicated gluten-free preparation areas or kitchens to minimize the risk.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Is gluten-free pizza healthier than regular pizza?</h3>
        <p>Not necessarily. While gluten-free pizza is essential for those with gluten-related disorders, it’s not inherently healthier. Some gluten-free crusts may contain more calories or fat than traditional crusts, so it’s important to check nutritional information.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I trust chain restaurants to provide truly gluten-free pizza?</h3>
        <p>Most reputable chains take gluten-free preparation seriously, but cross-contamination can still occur. Always ask about their preparation process and choose chains with dedicated gluten-free kitchens if you have celiac disease.</p>

        <h3>3. Are gluten-free pizzas more expensive?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free pizzas often cost more due to the higher price of alternative ingredients and the additional precautions required during preparation.</p>

        <h3>4. What are the best toppings for gluten-free pizza?</h3>
        <p>The best toppings depend on your personal taste. Popular options include fresh vegetables, high-quality meats, and flavorful cheeses. Many chains also offer vegan and dairy-free toppings for those with additional dietary restrictions.</p>
