    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Vegetable Pizza</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by mixing your gluten-free flour blend with xanthan gum, yeast, salt, and a bit of sugar. Add warm water and olive oil, then knead the dough until it’s smooth. Let it rise for about 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the recipe. Once risen, roll out the dough on a floured surface and transfer it to a pizza pan or baking sheet.</p>

    <h3>2. Add the Toppings</h3>
    <p>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the crust. Then, layer on your favorite vegetables. Popular choices include bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, and cherry tomatoes. If you’re using cheese, sprinkle it over the vegetables for a gooey, melty finish.</p>

    <h3>3. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) and bake the pizza for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. Keep an eye on it, as gluten-free crusts can brown faster than traditional ones.</p>
