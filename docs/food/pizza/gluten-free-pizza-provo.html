    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>1 tsp xanthan gum (if not included in your flour blend)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the yeast mixture, olive oil, and apple cider vinegar to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms.</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Is gluten-free pizza healthier than regular pizza?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free pizza can be healthier for individuals with gluten-related health issues, as it eliminates the risk of adverse reactions. However, it's important to note that gluten-free doesn't automatically mean healthier. Some gluten-free crusts may still be high in calories, fat, or sugar, so it's essential to read labels and choose nutrient-dense ingredients.</p>

        <h3>Can I find gluten-free pizza at most pizzerias?</h3>
        <p>Many pizzerias now offer gluten-free options, but it's always a good idea to call ahead and confirm. Additionally, be sure to ask about cross-contamination practices, as some restaurants may prepare gluten-free pizzas in the same area as regular pizzas, which could pose a risk for those with celiac disease.</p>

        <h3>What are some common gluten-free pizza toppings?</h3>
        <p>You can top your gluten-free pizza with just about anything! Popular options include fresh vegetables like bell peppers, mushrooms, and spinach, as well as proteins like grilled chicken, pepperoni, and sausage. For a vegan option, try using dairy-free cheese and plant-based toppings like artichokes and olives.</p>
