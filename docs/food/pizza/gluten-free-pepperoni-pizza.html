    <h1>Gluten-Free Pepperoni Pizza: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>Pizza is one of the most beloved foods worldwide, but for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying a traditional slice can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free pepperoni pizza—a delicious and healthy alternative that allows everyone to indulge in this classic comfort food. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free pizza, how to make it at home, and answer some frequently asked questions about this tasty dish.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Pepperoni Pizza?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and inflammation in some people. By opting for gluten-free pepperoni pizza, you can enjoy all the flavors of a traditional pizza without the adverse effects of gluten.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free pizza crusts are often made with nutrient-dense ingredients like almond flour, quinoa flour, or cauliflower, which can provide additional health benefits such as increased fiber and protein content. This makes gluten-free pepperoni pizza not only a safe choice for those with gluten sensitivities but also a nutritious option for anyone looking to improve their diet.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Pepperoni Pizza at Home</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free pepperoni pizza at home is easier than you might think. With a few simple ingredients and some basic kitchen tools, you can create a pizza that rivals your favorite pizzeria. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p>

        <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the crust, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese on top, followed by the pepperoni slices. Finish with a sprinkle of Italian seasoning.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong> Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (or onto the pizza stone if using) and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve hot and enjoy your homemade gluten-free pepperoni pizza!</li>
