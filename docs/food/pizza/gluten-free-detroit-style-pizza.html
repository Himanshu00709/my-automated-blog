<h1>Gluten-Free Detroit Style Pizza: A Delicious Revolution</h1>

<p>Detroit-style pizza has long been celebrated for its thick, crispy crust, cheesy edges, and unique square shape. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this iconic dish has often been out of reach. Enter gluten-free Detroit-style pizza—a culinary innovation that brings the same mouthwatering experience to everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. In this article, we’ll explore the rise of gluten-free Detroit-style pizza, its key characteristics, and where you can find the best options in Detroit and beyond.</p>

<h2>What Makes Detroit-Style Pizza Unique?</h2>

<p>Detroit-style pizza is distinct from other pizza styles due to its thick, airy crust, which is baked in a rectangular pan. The crust is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with caramelized cheese edges that add a delightful crunch. Traditionally, the pizza is topped with Wisconsin brick cheese, which melts beautifully and creates a rich, gooey texture. The sauce is often added on top of the cheese, giving it a unique presentation and flavor profile.</p>

<p>However, the traditional recipe relies heavily on wheat flour, making it unsuitable for those avoiding gluten. Fortunately, innovative chefs and pizzerias have risen to the challenge, creating gluten-free versions that retain the essence of Detroit-style pizza while catering to dietary needs.</p>

<h2>The Rise of Gluten-Free Detroit-Style Pizza</h2>

<p>As awareness of gluten-related disorders has grown, so has the demand for gluten-free alternatives. Detroit-style pizza, with its loyal following, was a natural candidate for adaptation. The key to creating a successful gluten-free version lies in the crust. Chefs have experimented with various gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, almond flour, and tapioca starch, to replicate the texture and flavor of the original.</p>

<p>One of the pioneers in this space is <strong>Buddy's Pizza</strong>, a Detroit institution that has been serving the city’s signature pizza since 1946. In recent years, Buddy’s has introduced a gluten-free crust option, allowing more people to enjoy their iconic pies. Other local pizzerias and national chains have followed suit, making gluten-free Detroit-style pizza more accessible than ever.</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics of Gluten-Free Detroit-Style Pizza</h2>
