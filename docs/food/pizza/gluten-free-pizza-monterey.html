<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Pizza Monterey at Home</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free pizza Monterey at home is a rewarding experience. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create your own delicious pizza:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, yeast, and salt. Gradually add warm water and olive oil, mixing until a dough forms. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the Dough Rise:</strong> Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up as well.</li>
    <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> On a floured surface, roll out the dough into your desired pizza shape. Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, followed by a generous amount of mozzarella cheese. Add your favorite vegetables and, if desired, seafood.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong> Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (or onto the pizza stone) and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve.</li>
</ol>
