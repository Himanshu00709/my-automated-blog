<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, yeast, salt, and sugar. Gradually add the warm water and olive oil, mixing until a dough forms. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the Dough Rise:</strong> Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Place a cast-iron skillet or pizza pan in the oven to heat up.</li>
    <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Once the dough has risen, transfer it to the hot skillet or pan. Press the dough out evenly to form a thick crust. Be careful, as the pan will be hot!</li>
    <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, then sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and your desired toppings.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
</ol>
