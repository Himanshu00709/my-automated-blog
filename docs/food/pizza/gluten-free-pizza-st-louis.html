    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>A great gluten-free pizza starts with the crust. The best gluten-free crusts are made from a blend of gluten-free flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour. These flours provide the necessary structure and texture without the gluten. Additionally, the toppings should be fresh and high-quality, and the sauce should be flavorful without being overly sweet or salty. Many pizzerias in St. Louis also offer vegan cheese options, making it easier for those with multiple dietary restrictions to enjoy a slice.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>
    <p>For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, gluten-free pizza is not just a preference—it's a necessity. Consuming gluten can lead to severe digestive issues, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term health problems. Even for those without gluten sensitivity, opting for a gluten-free pizza can sometimes be a healthier choice, especially if the crust is made from nutrient-dense ingredients like almond flour or cauliflower. These alternatives often contain more fiber and protein than traditional wheat-based crusts.</p>
