    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Heart-Shaped Pizza</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>If you’re using store-bought gluten-free pizza dough, follow the package instructions for preparation. If you’re making your own, mix gluten-free flour, yeast, water, and a pinch of salt until a dough forms. Knead the dough gently and let it rest for about 30 minutes to rise.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Shape the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough is ready, roll it out on a floured surface. Using a knife or pizza cutter, shape the dough into a heart. You can also use a heart-shaped template to guide you. Transfer the shaped dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Toppings</h3>
    <p>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce. Add your favorite toppings, arranging them in a way that complements the heart shape.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Pizza</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Brush the edges of the pizza with olive oil to achieve a golden crust. Bake the pizza for 10-12 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and the crust is golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Slice it into pieces and serve warm. Pair it with a fresh salad or a glass of wine for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Heart-Shaped Pizza</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use any gluten-free flour for the dough?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a variety of gluten-free flours such as almond flour, rice flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Each type of flour may slightly alter the texture and taste of the crust, so feel free to experiment to find your favorite.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I prevent the crust from becoming too dry?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free crusts can sometimes be drier than traditional ones. To prevent this, make sure to add enough moisture to the dough, and don’t overbake the pizza. Brushing the edges with olive oil before baking can also help retain moisture.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make the pizza vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the mozzarella cheese with a vegan cheese alternative and use plant-based toppings. Ensure that all ingredients, including the dough, are vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store leftover pizza?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover pizza in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, place the pizza in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes, or until warmed through.</p>
