<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Heart-Shaped Pizza</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

<p>Start by activating the yeast. In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt. Add the activated yeast mixture and olive oil, then mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough gently until it’s smooth and elastic.</p>

<h3>2. Shape the Dough into a Heart</h3>

<p>Once the dough is ready, roll it out on a floured surface into a large circle. Using a knife or pizza cutter, carefully shape the circle into a heart. You can also use a heart-shaped template if you want a more precise shape. Transfer the shaped dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.</p>

<h3>3. Add Toppings</h3>

<p>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce. Add your favorite toppings—whether it’s pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, or even pineapple. Get creative and make it your own!</p>

<h3>4. Bake the Pizza</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Bake the pizza for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly. Keep an eye on it to prevent burning, as gluten-free crusts can cook faster than traditional ones.</p>

<h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Once the pizza is out of the oven, let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve it with a side salad or your favorite dipping sauce, and enjoy your gluten-free heart-shaped masterpiece!</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Heart-Shaped Pizza</h2>

    <p>Yes, you can absolutely use store-bought gluten-free pizza dough if you’re short on time. Just make sure to follow the package instructions for shaping and baking.</p>

    <h3>2. What are some gluten-free flour alternatives?</h3>
    <p>There are several gluten-free flour alternatives available, including almond flour, coconut flour, rice flour, and chickpea flour. You can also use a pre-made gluten-free flour blend for convenience.</p>

    <h3>3. How do I prevent the crust from becoming too dry?</h3>
    <p>To prevent the crust from drying out, make sure not to overbake it. Additionally, adding a bit of olive oil to the dough can help keep it moist. You can also brush the crust with olive oil before baking for extra flavor and moisture.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I make this pizza vegan?</h3>
