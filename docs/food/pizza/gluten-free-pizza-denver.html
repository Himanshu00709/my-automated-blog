    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

    <p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. Here are some key factors to consider when choosing a gluten-free pizza:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crust Quality:</strong> The crust is the foundation of any good pizza. A great gluten-free crust should be crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and free from any gritty or chalky texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> Fresh, high-quality toppings can make or break a pizza. Look for places that use fresh vegetables, premium meats, and artisanal cheeses.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> For those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, cross-contamination is a serious concern. Ensure the restaurant has strict protocols in place to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety:</strong> A good gluten-free pizza place should offer a variety of options, from classic Margherita to more adventurous combinations.</li>
    </ul>
