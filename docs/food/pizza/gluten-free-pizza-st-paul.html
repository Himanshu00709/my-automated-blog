    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

    <p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. A great gluten-free pizza should have a crust that is both flavorful and structurally sound—no one wants a crust that crumbles at the first bite. The best gluten-free crusts are often made from a blend of gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour, which provide a good texture and taste. Additionally, the toppings should be fresh and high-quality, and the pizza should be prepared in a way that minimizes cross-contamination with gluten-containing ingredients.</p>
