    <h1>Gluten-Free Pizza: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>Pizza is a universally loved dish, but for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying a traditional slice can be a challenge. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free pizza has made it possible for everyone to indulge in this beloved comfort food without compromising their health. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free pizza, from its ingredients and nutritional benefits to tips for making the perfect slice at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free pizza is a variation of the classic pizza that eliminates gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. This makes it suitable for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those who choose to avoid gluten for other health reasons. The crust is typically made from alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour, which provide a similar texture and taste to traditional pizza crusts.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free pizza offers several benefits, particularly for those with gluten-related health issues. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Digestive Health:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues such as bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Gluten-free pizza eliminates these problems, allowing for a more comfortable dining experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich Ingredients:</strong> Many gluten-free pizza crusts are made from nutrient-dense flours like almond or chickpea flour, which provide additional vitamins, minerals, and protein compared to traditional wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight Management:</strong> Some gluten-free pizza options are lower in calories and carbohydrates, making them a better choice for those looking to manage their weight.</li>
