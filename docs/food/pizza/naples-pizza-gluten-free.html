    <h1>Naples Pizza Gluten-Free: A Culinary Delight</h1>
    <p>Naples, the birthplace of pizza, is renowned for its traditional Neapolitan pizza, a dish that has captivated the world. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying this culinary masterpiece can be a challenge. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free options has made it possible for everyone to savor the authentic flavors of Naples pizza. In this article, we will explore the world of Naples pizza gluten-free, its history, preparation, and where to find the best options.</p>

    <h2>The History of Naples Pizza</h2>
    <p>Naples pizza, or <em>Pizza Napoletana</em>, has a rich history dating back to the 18th century. It was originally a simple dish made with basic ingredients: dough, tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and basil. The pizza was cooked in a wood-fired oven, giving it a unique flavor and texture. Over time, this humble dish gained popularity and became a symbol of Italian cuisine.</p>
    <p>However, traditional Naples pizza is made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. For those with gluten sensitivity, this poses a problem. The good news is that modern culinary techniques have made it possible to create gluten-free versions of this beloved dish without compromising on taste or authenticity.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Naples Pizza Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free Naples pizza is made using alternative flours that do not contain gluten. Common substitutes include rice flour, almond flour, and tapioca flour. These flours are combined with other ingredients to create a dough that mimics the texture and flavor of traditional pizza dough. The key to a successful gluten-free pizza lies in the preparation and cooking process.</p>
    <p>Here’s a breakdown of the ingredients typically used in gluten-free Naples pizza:</p>

    <table>

            <tr>
                <td>Almond Flour</td>
                <td>Adds a nutty flavor and helps bind the dough</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Tapioca Flour</td>
                <td>Improves elasticity and chewiness</td>
            </tr>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Naples Pizza at Home</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free Naples pizza at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create your own delicious gluten-free pizza:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Mix the gluten-free flours, xanthan gum, salt, and yeast in a bowl. Gradually add warm water and olive oil, kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Dough Rest:</strong> Cover the dough and let it rest for at least an hour to allow the flavors to develop and the dough to rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> If you have a wood-fired oven, preheat it to the highest temperature. If not, a conventional oven set to 475°F (245°C) will work.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Roll out the dough into a thin circle, ensuring it’s evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce, add fresh mozzarella, and top with basil leaves or other desired toppings.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the pizza in the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
