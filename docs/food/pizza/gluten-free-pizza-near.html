    <h1>Gluten-Free Pizza Near You: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For those with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or simply a preference for gluten-free options, finding a delicious and safe gluten-free pizza can be a challenge. Fortunately, the demand for gluten-free dining options has grown significantly in recent years, leading to an increase in restaurants and pizzerias offering gluten-free pizza. In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about finding the best gluten-free pizza near you, including what to look for, popular chains, and tips for ensuring a safe dining experience.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free pizza is made without any ingredients that contain gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Traditional pizza crust is typically made from wheat flour, which contains gluten. Gluten-free pizza crusts are made from alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour. These crusts are designed to mimic the texture and taste of traditional pizza crust while being safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <p>It’s important to note that not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. Cross-contamination can occur if the pizza is prepared in the same kitchen as gluten-containing foods. Therefore, it’s crucial to choose a restaurant that takes precautions to prevent cross-contamination, such as using separate cooking utensils and preparation areas.</p>
