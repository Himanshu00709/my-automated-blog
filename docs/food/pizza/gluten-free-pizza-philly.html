    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. A great gluten-free pizza starts with the crust. The best gluten-free crusts are made from a blend of gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, almond flour, and tapioca starch, which create a texture that’s both crispy and chewy. The toppings are equally important—fresh, high-quality ingredients can elevate a gluten-free pizza from good to extraordinary. Additionally, cross-contamination is a concern for those with celiac disease, so it’s essential that the pizzeria takes precautions to ensure that gluten-free pizzas are prepared separately from gluten-containing ones.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Pizza Toppings to Try</h2>
    <p>One of the best things about pizza is the endless variety of toppings you can choose from. Here are some delicious gluten-free topping combinations to try:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Margherita:</strong> Fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil—a classic combination that never disappoints.</li>
        <li><strong>BBQ Chicken:</strong> BBQ sauce, grilled chicken, red onions, and cilantro for a tangy and savory flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Veggie Delight:</strong> A mix of roasted vegetables like bell peppers, zucchini, and mushrooms, topped with a sprinkle of goat cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Pepperoni and Mushroom:</strong> A timeless favorite with a gluten-free twist.</li>
        <li><strong>Pesto and Artichoke:</strong> A flavorful combination of pesto sauce, artichoke hearts, and sun-dried tomatoes.</li>
    </ul>
