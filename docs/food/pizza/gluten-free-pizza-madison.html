<h2>What to Look for in a Gluten-Free Pizza Crust</h2>

<p>When choosing a gluten-free pizza, the crust is one of the most important factors to consider. A good gluten-free crust should be crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and free from any gritty or overly dense texture. Here are some key things to look for:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Look for crusts made with high-quality, whole-food ingredients like almond flour, tapioca starch, or rice flour.</li>
    <li><strong>Texture:</strong> The crust should have a balanced texture—not too dry or too moist.</li>
    <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> A good gluten-free crust should complement the toppings, not overpower them.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> Ensure the restaurant has protocols in place to prevent cross-contamination if you have celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making Your Own Gluten-Free Pizza at Home</h2>

<p>If you're feeling adventurous, making your own gluten-free pizza at home can be a fun and rewarding experience. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

<h3>Gluten-Free Pizza Crust Recipe</h3>

    <li>1 1/2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
    <li>1 tsp xanthan gum (if not included in your flour blend)</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
    <li>1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) active dry yeast</li>
    <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, salt, and sugar.</li>
