    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

    <p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. Here are some key factors to consider when choosing a gluten-free pizza:</p>

    <h3>Crust Quality</h3>

    <p>The crust is the foundation of any pizza, and for gluten-free options, it's crucial that the crust is both flavorful and has the right texture. Look for crusts made from high-quality ingredients like almond flour, cauliflower, or a blend of gluten-free grains. A good gluten-free crust should be crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.</p>

    <h3>Toppings and Sauces</h3>

    <p>While the crust is important, the toppings and sauces can make or break your pizza experience. Opt for fresh, high-quality ingredients, and be sure to ask about the gluten-free status of sauces and toppings. Some pizzerias offer vegan or dairy-free cheese options, which can be a great addition for those with additional dietary restrictions.</p>

    <h3>Cross-Contamination</h3>

    <p>For those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, cross-contamination is a serious concern. Many restaurants now offer dedicated gluten-free preparation areas and utensils to minimize the risk of cross-contamination. Always ask about the restaurant's practices to ensure your meal is safe.</p>
