<h2>What to Look for in a Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>

<p>When searching for the perfect gluten-free pizza, there are a few key factors to consider:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Crust Quality:</strong> The crust is the foundation of any pizza. Look for a crust that is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, without being overly dry or crumbly.</li>
    <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> A great gluten-free pizza should offer a variety of fresh and flavorful toppings. Whether you prefer classic pepperoni or more adventurous options like arugula and prosciutto, the toppings should complement the crust.</li>

    <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Dining out is about more than just the food. Choose a restaurant with a welcoming atmosphere where you can enjoy your meal comfortably.</li>
