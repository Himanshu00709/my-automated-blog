    <h1>Gluten-Free Pizza LBI: A Delicious and Healthy Option</h1>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free pizza is not just a trend; it’s a necessity for many people.

    <p>But even for those without gluten sensitivities, gluten-free pizza can be a healthier option. Many gluten-free crusts are made with nutrient-dense ingredients like almond flour, quinoa, or cauliflower, which can provide additional vitamins and minerals. Plus, gluten-free pizza often contains fewer calories and carbs, making it a great choice for those looking to maintain a healthy diet.</p>
