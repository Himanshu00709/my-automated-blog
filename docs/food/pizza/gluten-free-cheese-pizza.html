    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Cheese Pizza at Home</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free cheese pizza at home is easier than you might think. With the right ingredients and a little patience, you can create a delicious pizza that rivals any restaurant offering. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon xanthan gum (if not included in your flour blend)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 packet (2 ¼ teaspoons) instant yeast</li>
        <li>¾ cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Optional toppings: fresh basil, pepperoni, mushrooms, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, salt, sugar, and yeast. Mix well. Add the warm water and olive oil, and stir until a dough forms. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Dough Rise:</strong> Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes. This will help the dough become lighter and easier to work with.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Roll out the dough on a piece of parchment paper to your desired thickness. If the dough is sticky, you can lightly dust it with more gluten-free flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese on top, and add any additional toppings you like.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong> Carefully transfer the pizza (with the parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone or a baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve with fresh basil or a drizzle of olive oil for extra flavor.</li>
    </ol>
