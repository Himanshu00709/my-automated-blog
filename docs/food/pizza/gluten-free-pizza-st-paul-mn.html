    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

    <p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. A great gluten-free pizza should have a crust that is both flavorful and structurally soundâ€”no one wants a crust that crumbles at the first bite.

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crust Quality:</strong> The crust should be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, without any gritty or chalky texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> Fresh, high-quality toppings can make or break a pizza. Look for places that use locally sourced ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> Ensure that the restaurant takes precautions to avoid cross-contamination, such as using separate preparation areas and utensils.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety:</strong> A good gluten-free pizza place should offer a variety of options, from classic Margherita to more adventurous combinations.</li>
    </ul>
