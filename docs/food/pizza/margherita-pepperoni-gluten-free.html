    <h1>Margherita Pepperoni Gluten-Free Pizza: A Delicious Twist on a Classic</h1>

    <p>Pizza is a universally loved dish, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a traditional slice can be a challenge. Enter the Margherita Pepperoni Gluten-Free Pizza—a perfect blend of classic flavors and modern dietary needs. This pizza combines the simplicity of a Margherita with the boldness of pepperoni, all on a gluten-free crust. In this article, we’ll explore the origins of this dish, its nutritional benefits, and how you can make it at home.</p>

    <h2>The Origins of Margherita Pizza</h2>

    <p>The Margherita pizza has its roots in Naples, Italy, and is named after Queen Margherita of Savoy. Legend has it that in 1889, the queen visited Naples, and a local pizzaiolo (pizza maker) created a pizza in her honor. The pizza featured the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomatoes), white (mozzarella), and green (basil). This simple yet flavorful combination has stood the test of time and remains a favorite among pizza lovers worldwide.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity in recent years, not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals with gluten sensitivities or those seeking a healthier lifestyle. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause digestive issues and inflammation in some people. A gluten-free crust allows everyone to enjoy pizza without the adverse effects of gluten.</p>
