<h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

<p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. A great gluten-free pizza should have a crust that is both flavorful and has the right texture—crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

Here are some key factors to consider when choosing a gluten-free pizza:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Crust Quality:</strong> The crust should be made from high-quality gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, rice flour, or tapioca flour. It should be well-balanced in terms of flavor and texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> Fresh, high-quality toppings are essential. Look for places that use organic vegetables, premium meats, and artisanal cheeses.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> For those with celiac disease, it’s crucial to ensure that the pizza is prepared in a dedicated gluten-free environment to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
</ul>
