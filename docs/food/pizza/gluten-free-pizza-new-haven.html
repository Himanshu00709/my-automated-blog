    <h1>Gluten-Free Pizza in New Haven: A Culinary Adventure</h1>
    <p>New Haven, Connecticut, is renowned for its pizza, often referred to as "apizza" by locals. This unique style of pizza, characterized by its thin, crispy crust and minimalist toppings, has earned the city a spot on the culinary map. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this iconic dish can be a challenge. Fortunately, New Haven has embraced the gluten-free movement, offering a variety of options for gluten-free pizza lovers. In this article, we’ll explore the best gluten-free pizza options in New Haven, the history of the city’s pizza culture, and tips for enjoying gluten-free dining in this pizza haven.</p>

    <h2>The History of New Haven Pizza</h2>
    <p>New Haven’s pizza tradition dates back to the early 20th century when Italian immigrants brought their culinary expertise to the city. The term "apizza" (pronounced "ah-beets") is derived from the Neapolitan dialect and reflects the city’s deep-rooted connection to Italian pizza-making traditions. Unlike the thicker, doughier pizzas found in other parts of the United States, New Haven-style pizza is known for its thin, charred crust, which is achieved by baking in a coal-fired oven. This method imparts a unique flavor and texture that has become synonymous with New Haven pizza.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Pizza in New Haven: A Growing Trend</h2>
    <p>As awareness of gluten-related disorders has increased, so too has the demand for gluten-free dining options. New Haven’s pizzerias have risen to the occasion, offering gluten-free crusts that cater to those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. These crusts are often made from a blend of alternative flours, such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca starch, and are carefully prepared to avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing ingredients.</p>
