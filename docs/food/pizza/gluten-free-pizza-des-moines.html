<h2>What to Look for in a Gluten-Free Pizza Crust</h2>

<p>When ordering gluten-free pizza, it's important to consider the quality of the crust. Here are some factors to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Look for crusts made from high-quality, gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or rice flour. Avoid crusts that contain fillers or artificial additives.</li>
    <li><strong>Texture:</strong> A good gluten-free crust should have a balance of crispiness and chewiness. It shouldn't be too dry or crumbly.</li>
    <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> The crust should complement the toppings, not overpower them. Some gluten-free crusts have a nutty or slightly sweet flavor, which can enhance the overall taste of the pizza.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If you have celiac disease or a severe gluten intolerance, make sure the restaurant takes precautions to avoid cross-contamination. This includes using separate utensils, pans, and preparation areas for gluten-free items.</li>
</ul>
