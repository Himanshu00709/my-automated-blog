<h1>Gluten-Free Fried Seafood Near Me: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For seafood lovers with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a place that offers gluten-free fried seafood can be a challenge. However, with the growing awareness of gluten-related health issues, many restaurants are now offering gluten-free options. In this blog post, we’ll explore the best places to find gluten-free fried seafood near you, what to look for when dining out, and some tips for ensuring a safe and delicious meal.</p>

<h2>Why Gluten-Free Fried Seafood?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause serious health issues for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Traditional fried seafood is often coated in flour or breadcrumbs, which contain gluten. However, many restaurants are now using gluten-free alternatives like rice flour, cornmeal, or gluten-free breadcrumbs to create the same crispy texture without the gluten. This allows those with dietary restrictions to enjoy their favorite fried seafood dishes without worry.</p>
