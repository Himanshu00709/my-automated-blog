    <h1>Gluten-Free Bakery in Peoria, IL: A Haven for Celiac and Gluten-Sensitive Individuals</h1>

    <p>For those living with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding a bakery that caters to their dietary needs can be a challenge. Fortunately, Peoria, IL, is home to several gluten-free bakeries that offer delicious, safe, and wholesome baked goods. Whether you're craving bread, pastries, or cakes, these bakeries ensure that you don't have to compromise on taste or quality. In this article, we'll explore the gluten-free bakery scene in Peoria, IL, and highlight what makes these establishments stand out.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Matters</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten can cause discomfort, bloating, and other digestive issues. As a result, gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not just for those with medical conditions but also for people seeking healthier eating habits.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free baking, however, is not as simple as removing wheat flour from recipes. Gluten provides elasticity and structure to baked goods, so bakers must use alternative flours and binders to achieve the right texture and taste. This requires skill, creativity, and a deep understanding of gluten-free ingredients.</p>
