    <h2>The Art of Gluten-Free Baking</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking is both a science and an art. Traditional baking relies on gluten to provide structure and elasticity to dough, but gluten-free baking requires alternative ingredients and techniques to achieve similar results. Common gluten-free flours include almond flour, coconut flour, rice flour, and tapioca flour. These flours are often combined with xanthan gum or psyllium husk to mimic the binding properties of gluten.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free bakers in Connecticut are known for their creativity and innovation. They experiment with different flour blends, natural sweeteners, and unique flavor combinations to create baked goods that are not only safe but also delicious and satisfying. Many of these bakeries also cater to other dietary restrictions, offering vegan, dairy-free, and nut-free options.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Baking</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking offers several benefits beyond catering to those with gluten-related disorders. Many people find that gluten-free baked goods are easier to digest and can help reduce bloating and other digestive discomforts. Additionally, gluten-free baking often incorporates whole, nutrient-dense ingredients, making these baked goods a healthier option for everyone.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free baking encourages the use of alternative grains and flours, which can add variety to your diet and introduce you to new flavors and textures. For example, almond flour adds a rich, nutty flavor to baked goods, while coconut flour provides a light, airy texture.</p>
