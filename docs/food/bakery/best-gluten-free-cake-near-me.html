    <h2>What to Look for in a Gluten-Free Cake</h2>

    <p>When searching for the best gluten-free cake, there are a few key factors to consider:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Ensure the cake is made with high-quality, gluten-free ingredients. Look for cakes that use almond flour, coconut flour, or rice flour as a base.</li>
        <li><strong>Texture:</strong> A good gluten-free cake should be moist and fluffy, not dry or crumbly. The texture is often a telltale sign of the baker’s skill.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> The cake should be rich in flavor, with no aftertaste from gluten-free substitutes. Whether it’s chocolate, vanilla, or fruit-based, the flavor should be well-balanced.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If you have celiac disease, ensure the bakery follows strict protocols to avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing products.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Store Gluten-Free Cakes</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free cakes can sometimes dry out faster than traditional cakes due to the absence of gluten, which helps retain moisture. To keep your gluten-free cake fresh and delicious, follow these storage tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Room Temperature:</strong> Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.</li>
        <li><strong>Refrigeration:</strong> For longer storage, refrigerate the cake in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Bring it to room temperature before serving.</li>
        <li><strong>Freezing:</strong> Gluten-free cakes freeze well. Wrap the cake tightly in plastic wrap and store it in a freezer-safe container for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before serving.</li>
    </ul>
