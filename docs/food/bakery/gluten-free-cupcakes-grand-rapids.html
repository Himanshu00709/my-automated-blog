    <h2>Baking Your Own Gluten-Free Cupcakes</h2>
    <p>If you’re a home baker, making gluten-free cupcakes can be a rewarding experience. Here are some tips to ensure your cupcakes turn out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Opt for gluten-free flour blends that are specifically designed for baking. Almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour are popular choices.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Binders:</strong> Gluten-free flours lack the binding properties of wheat flour. Adding xanthan gum or psyllium husk can help mimic the texture of traditional cupcakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cupcakes. Mix the batter just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free baking opens up a world of flavor possibilities. Try adding citrus zest, spices, or even fresh fruit to your cupcakes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cupcakes</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Are gluten-free cupcakes healthier?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cupcakes are not inherently healthier than traditional cupcakes. They are designed for those who cannot consume gluten due to medical or dietary reasons. However, they can be made healthier by using whole-grain gluten-free flours and reducing sugar content.</p>

        <h3>Can I find gluten-free cupcakes at regular bakeries?</h3>
        <p>Some regular bakeries offer gluten-free options, but cross-contamination can be a concern. It’s best to visit dedicated gluten-free bakeries or those with strict protocols to avoid gluten contamination.</p>

        <h3>What’s the difference between gluten-free and vegan cupcakes?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cupcakes are made without gluten-containing ingredients, while vegan cupcakes are made without any animal products. Some bakeries offer both gluten-free and vegan options, but they are not the same.</p>

        <h3>How do I store gluten-free cupcakes?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cupcakes should be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two days. For longer storage, refrigerate them for up to a week or freeze them for up to three months.</p>
