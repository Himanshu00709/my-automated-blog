    <h2>Baking Your Own Gluten-Free Cupcakes</h2>
    <p>If you're feeling adventurous, why not try baking your own gluten-free cupcakes? Here are some tips to get you started:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose blend work best.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Binders:</strong> Since gluten provides structure, you'll need to add binders like xanthan gum or psyllium husk to your batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cupcakes. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free baking allows for creativity. Try adding citrus zest, spices, or even fresh fruit to your batter.</li>
    </ul>
