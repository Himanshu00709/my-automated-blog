    <h2>Baking Your Own Gluten-Free Cakes</h2>

    <p>If you prefer to bake at home, creating gluten-free cakes can be a rewarding experience. Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free cakes turn out perfectly:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour are popular choices. You can also use a gluten-free flour blend for a more traditional texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Binders:</strong> Gluten-free flours lack the binding properties of wheat flour, so adding xanthan gum or psyllium husk can help hold the cake together.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be enhanced with flavors like citrus zest, vanilla, or spices to add depth.</li>
    </ul>
