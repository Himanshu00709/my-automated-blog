    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Matters</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. For those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can cause symptoms like bloating, headaches, and fatigue. Even for those without these conditions, many people choose gluten-free diets for their potential health benefits, such as improved digestion and reduced inflammation.</p>

    <p>Edina's gluten-free bakeries understand the importance of providing safe, delicious options for their customers. They go above and beyond to ensure that their products are free from cross-contamination, using dedicated equipment and certified gluten-free ingredients. This commitment to quality and safety makes Edina a standout destination for gluten-free baked goods.</p>
