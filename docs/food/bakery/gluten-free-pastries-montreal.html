    <h1>Gluten-Free Pastries in Montreal: A Guide to Delicious and Healthy Treats</h1>

    <p>Montreal, known for its vibrant culinary scene, has embraced the gluten-free movement with open arms. Whether you're a celiac sufferer, gluten-sensitive, or simply looking to reduce gluten in your diet, the city offers a plethora of options for indulging in gluten-free pastries. From flaky croissants to decadent cakes, Montreal’s bakeries and cafes have mastered the art of creating gluten-free delights that don’t compromise on taste or texture.
