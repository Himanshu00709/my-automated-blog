    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Cake?</h2>
    <p>A great gluten-free cake is more than just the absence of gluten. It’s about achieving the right balance of flavors, textures, and moisture. Here are some key factors that contribute to a delicious gluten-free cake:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality Ingredients:</strong> Using high-quality gluten-free flours, such as almond or oat flour, can make a significant difference in the taste and texture of the cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Moisture:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can sometimes be dry, so adding ingredients like applesauce, yogurt, or extra eggs can help retain moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> Incorporating natural flavors like vanilla, citrus zest, or spices can enhance the overall taste of the cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Achieving the right crumb structure is crucial. Xanthan gum or psyllium husk can help mimic the elasticity that gluten provides.</li>
