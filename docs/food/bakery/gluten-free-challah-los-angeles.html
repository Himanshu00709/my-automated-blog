    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Challah?</h2>

    <p>A great gluten-free challah should have a soft, fluffy texture and a slightly sweet flavor, just like traditional challah. Achieving this can be challenging due to the absence of gluten, which provides structure and elasticity to the dough. However, with the right combination of gluten-free flours and binders like xanthan gum or psyllium husk, bakers can create a challah that is both delicious and structurally sound.</p>

    <p>When choosing a gluten-free challah, look for one that is made with high-quality ingredients and has a good balance of moisture and density. The challah should be able to hold its shape when braided and should have a golden, slightly crispy crust.</p>
