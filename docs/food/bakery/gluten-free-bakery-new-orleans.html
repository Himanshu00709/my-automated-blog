    <h2>The Art of Gluten-Free Baking</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking is both a science and an art. Traditional baking relies heavily on gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, to provide structure and elasticity to baked goods. When gluten is removed, bakers must find alternative ways to achieve the same texture and consistency. This often involves using a combination of gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, rice flour, and tapioca starch, along with binders like xanthan gum or psyllium husk. The result is baked goods that are just as delicious and satisfying as their gluten-containing counterparts.</p>

    <p>In New Orleans, gluten-free bakers take pride in their craft, experimenting with different ingredients and techniques to create products that are not only safe for those with gluten sensitivities but also incredibly tasty. Many of these bakeries also focus on using locally sourced, organic ingredients, ensuring that their products are not only gluten-free but also healthy and sustainable.</p>
