    <h2>The Science Behind Gluten-Free Baking</h2>

    <p>Creating gluten-free baked goods that are both delicious and structurally sound is no easy feat. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, provides elasticity and structure to traditional baked goods. Without it, bakers must rely on alternative ingredients and techniques to achieve similar results. At Albany Gluten-Free Bakery, the team uses a combination of gluten-free flours (such as almond, rice, and tapioca flour), xanthan gum, and other binding agents to replicate the texture and taste of gluten-containing products.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the bakery’s commitment to continuous innovation ensures that their offerings are not only safe but also nutritionally balanced. Many of their products are enriched with vitamins and minerals to compensate for the nutrients often lacking in gluten-free diets.</p>
