    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Chocolate Croissants</h2>

    <p>While traditional croissants are often seen as a treat with little nutritional value, gluten-free chocolate croissants can offer some health benefits, especially when made with high-quality ingredients. For example, almond flour is rich in healthy fats, protein, and fiber, making it a more nutritious option than refined wheat flour. Additionally, dark chocolate, often used in the filling, is packed with antioxidants and can support heart health when consumed in moderation. However, it’s important to remember that gluten-free does not always mean low-calorie, so portion control is still key.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Chocolate Croissants at Home</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free chocolate croissants at home can be a rewarding experience. While the process is more involved than traditional baking, the results are well worth the effort. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Mix gluten-free flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a bowl. Add softened butter, eggs, and milk, then knead until a smooth dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to make it easier to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll and Fold:</strong> Roll out the dough into a rectangle, then fold it into thirds like a letter. Repeat this process several times to create layers.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Croissants:</strong> Cut the dough into triangles, place a piece of chocolate at the base of each triangle, and roll them up into crescent shapes.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Brush the croissants with an egg wash and bake in a preheated oven until golden brown and flaky.</li>
    </ol>
