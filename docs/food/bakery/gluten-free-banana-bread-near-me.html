    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Banana Bread</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Is gluten-free banana bread healthier than regular banana bread?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free banana bread can be a healthier option for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. However, it’s important to note that gluten-free doesn’t automatically mean healthier. The nutritional value depends on the ingredients used. For example, using almond flour can add healthy fats and protein, while coconut flour is high in fiber. Always check the ingredients to ensure it aligns with your dietary goals.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I freeze gluten-free banana bread?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free banana bread freezes well. Allow the bread to cool completely, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place it in a freezer-safe bag or container and store it in the freezer for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to enjoy it, simply thaw it at room temperature or warm it in the oven.</p>

        <h3>3. What can I use instead of almond flour in gluten-free banana bread?</h3>
        <p>If you’re allergic to nuts or prefer not to use almond flour, you can substitute it with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour, oat flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Keep in mind that different flours have different absorption rates, so you may need to adjust the amount of liquid in the recipe.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I know if a bakery’s gluten-free banana bread is safe for celiacs?</h3>
        <p>When purchasing gluten-free banana bread from a bakery, it’s important to ask about their preparation methods. Cross-contamination can occur if the bakery also uses gluten-containing ingredients. Look for bakeries that have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen or follow strict protocols to prevent cross-contamination.</p>
