    <h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Bakery?</h2>

For individuals with celiac disease, even trace amounts of gluten can trigger severe health issues, making dedicated gluten-free bakeries essential. These bakeries ensure that their products are safe for consumption by using gluten-free ingredients and maintaining strict cross-contamination protocols.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free bakeries often use alternative flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour, which not only cater to gluten-free diets but also offer unique flavors and textures. This makes gluten-free baked goods a delightful option for everyone, not just those with dietary restrictions.</p>

Bakers often experiment with different combinations of flours, starches, and binders to achieve the perfect texture and taste.
