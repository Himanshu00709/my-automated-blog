    <h2>Tips for Choosing the Perfect Gluten-Free Bakery Name</h2>
    <p>Selecting the right name for your gluten-free bakery requires careful consideration. Here are some tips to guide you:</p>

    <h3>1. Reflect Your Brand Identity</h3>
    <p>Your bakery’s name should align with your brand’s mission, values, and target audience. If your bakery focuses on organic ingredients, consider incorporating words like "pure," "natural," or "organic" into the name. For a more playful vibe, opt for whimsical or fun names.</p>

    <h3>2. Keep It Simple and Memorable</h3>
    <p>A short, easy-to-pronounce name is more likely to stick in customers’ minds. Avoid overly complex or lengthy names that may be difficult to remember or spell.</p>

    <h3>3. Highlight Gluten-Free</h3>
    <p>Make it clear that your bakery specializes in gluten-free products. Including terms like "gluten-free," "GF," or "wheat-free" in your name can help attract the right customers.</p>

    <h3>4. Consider Local Appeal</h3>
    <p>If your bakery serves a specific community, consider incorporating local landmarks, traditions, or cultural elements into the name. This can create a sense of belonging and loyalty among local customers.</p>

    <h3>5. Check Availability</h3>
    <p>Before finalizing your bakery’s name, ensure that the domain name and social media handles are available. You should also check for trademark conflicts to avoid legal issues down the line.</p>
