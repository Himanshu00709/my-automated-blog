    <h1>Gluten-Free Bakery in Lawrence: A Haven for Celiac and Gluten-Sensitive Individuals</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Lawrence, a vibrant city known for its culinary diversity, has embraced this trend with open arms. Among the many gluten-free options available, the gluten-free bakeries in Lawrence stand out as a beacon of hope for those who must avoid gluten but still crave delicious baked goods.

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Matters</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause a range of health issues, from digestive problems to severe autoimmune reactions. Celiac disease affects approximately 1% of the population, and gluten sensitivity is even more common. For these individuals, avoiding gluten is not a lifestyle choice but a medical necessity.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have also gained popularity among people without celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, often as a way to improve digestion or overall health. However, it's important to note that a gluten-free diet is only beneficial for those who medically need it.
