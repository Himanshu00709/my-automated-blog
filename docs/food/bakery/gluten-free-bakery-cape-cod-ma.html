    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Matters</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free diets are not just a trend; for many, they are a necessity. Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, affects approximately 1% of the global population. Gluten sensitivity, though not as severe, can also cause discomfort and health issues for many individuals. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause inflammation and damage to the small intestine in those with celiac disease. For these individuals, avoiding gluten is not a choice but a critical part of maintaining their health.</p>

    <p>Beyond medical necessity, many people choose gluten-free diets for their perceived health benefits, such as improved digestion and increased energy levels. Whatever the reason, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and Cape Cod’s bakeries have risen to the occasion, offering a variety of gluten-free options that don’t compromise on taste or quality.</p>
