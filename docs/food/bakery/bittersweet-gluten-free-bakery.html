    <h2>The Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Baking</h2>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, avoiding gluten is essential for maintaining good health. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can trigger an immune response in those with celiac disease, leading to damage in the small intestine and a host of other symptoms. Even for those without celiac disease, reducing gluten intake can sometimes alleviate digestive issues, improve energy levels, and support overall well-being.</p>

    <p>Bittersweet Gluten-Free Bakery not only provides safe options for those who need to avoid gluten but also ensures that their products are made with wholesome, nutrient-dense ingredients. By using alternative flours like almond, coconut, and quinoa, the bakery’s offerings are often higher in protein, fiber, and healthy fats compared to traditional baked goods.</p>
