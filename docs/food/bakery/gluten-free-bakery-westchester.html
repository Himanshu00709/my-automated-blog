    <h2>What Makes These Bakeries Stand Out?</h2>

    <p>What sets Westchester's gluten-free bakeries apart is their commitment to quality and innovation. These establishments use high-quality, gluten-free flours like almond, coconut, and rice flour to create baked goods that are not only safe but also flavorful.

    <p>Gluten-free baking is both an art and a science. Without gluten, which provides elasticity and structure to baked goods, achieving the right texture can be challenging. Gluten-free bakers often rely on a combination of alternative flours, starches, and binders like xanthan gum to mimic the properties of gluten. This requires a deep understanding of how different ingredients interact, making gluten-free baking a specialized skill. The result? Baked goods that are just as satisfying as their gluten-containing counterparts.</p>
