    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Bakeries</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Are gluten-free baked goods healthier?</h3>
        <p>Not necessarily. While gluten-free products are essential for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, they are not inherently healthier than their gluten-containing counterparts. Some gluten-free products may contain more sugar or fat to compensate for the lack of gluten, so it's important to read labels and choose products made with whole, nutritious ingredients.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I find gluten-free options at regular bakeries?</h3>
        <p>Some regular bakeries may offer a few gluten-free options, but there is always a risk of cross-contamination. For those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, it's best to visit a dedicated gluten-free bakery where all products are made in a gluten-free environment.</p>

        <h3>3. Are gluten-free baked goods more expensive?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free products can be more expensive due to the cost of alternative ingredients and the specialized processes required to avoid cross-contamination. However, many people find the extra cost worthwhile for the peace of mind and the ability to enjoy delicious baked goods without adverse health effects.</p>
