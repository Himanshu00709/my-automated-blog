    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Bakeries</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. What is gluten, and why do some people avoid it?</h3>
        <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Some people avoid gluten due to celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes damage to the small intestine when gluten is consumed. Others may have non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which can cause similar symptoms without the autoimmune response.</p>

        <h3>2. Are gluten-free products healthier?</h3>
        <p>Not necessarily. While gluten-free products are essential for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, they are not inherently healthier for the general population. Some gluten-free products may contain higher levels of sugar and fat to compensate for the lack of gluten.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I find gluten-free options at regular bakeries?</h3>
        <p>Some regular bakeries may offer gluten-free options, but there is a risk of cross-contamination. For those with celiac disease, it’s safer to choose a dedicated gluten-free bakery like Sweet Freedom Bakery in Schaumburg, IL.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I know if a bakery is truly gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Look for bakeries that are certified gluten-free or operate in a dedicated gluten-free facility. This ensures that there is no risk of cross-contamination with gluten-containing products.</p>
