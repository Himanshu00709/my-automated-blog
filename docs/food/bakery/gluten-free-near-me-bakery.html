    <h1>Gluten-Free Bakery Near Me: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the general preference for healthier eating options. For those who must avoid gluten, finding a reliable gluten-free bakery can be a game-changer. This guide will help you navigate the world of gluten-free bakeries, offering tips on what to look for, what to expect, and how to find the best gluten-free bakery near you.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Gluten sensitivity, on the other hand, may cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue without the intestinal damage seen in celiac disease.</p>

    <p>Going gluten-free is not just a dietary choice for many; it's a necessity. However, finding gluten-free options, especially in bakeries, can be challenging. This is where gluten-free bakeries come into play, offering a safe haven for those who need to avoid gluten but still want to enjoy delicious baked goods.</p>
