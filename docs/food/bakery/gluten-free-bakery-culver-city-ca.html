    <h1>Gluten-Free Bakery in Culver City, CA: A Haven for Celiac and Gluten-Sensitive Foodies</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and the growing preference for healthier dietary choices.

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten consumption. Even a small amount of gluten can cause severe digestive issues, nutrient malabsorption, and long-term health complications. Additionally, many people experience non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which can lead to symptoms like bloating, headaches, and fatigue. Beyond medical necessity, some choose gluten-free diets for perceived health benefits, such as improved digestion and increased energy levels.</p>

    <h2>What Makes These Bakeries Stand Out?</h2>
    <p>These bakeries go beyond simply offering gluten-free options. They prioritize quality ingredients, innovative recipes, and a commitment to creating products that everyone can enjoy.

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Almond Flour:</strong> Rich in protein, healthy fats, and vitamin E.</li>
        <li><strong>Coconut Flour:</strong> High in fiber and low in carbohydrates.</li>
        <li><strong>Quinoa Flour:</strong> Packed with essential amino acids and minerals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By incorporating these ingredients, gluten-free bakeries in Culver City provide not only safe options for those with dietary restrictions but also nutrient-dense alternatives for health-conscious consumers.</p>
