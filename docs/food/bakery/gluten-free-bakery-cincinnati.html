    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Bakery?</h2>
    <p>Not all gluten-free bakeries are created equal. Here are some key factors to consider when choosing a gluten-free bakery:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Certification:</strong> Look for bakeries that are certified gluten-free to ensure they meet strict standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety:</strong> A good bakery offers a wide range of products, from bread and cakes to cookies and pastries.</li>
        <li><strong>Taste:</strong> Gluten-free doesn't have to mean taste-free. The best bakeries create products that are just as delicious as their gluten-containing counterparts.</li>
        <li><strong>Freshness:</strong> Freshly baked goods are always better. Check if the bakery bakes daily or uses preservatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Reviews:</strong> Read reviews to gauge the quality and reliability of the bakery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Science Behind Gluten-Free Baking</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking is a science in itself. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, provides elasticity and structure to baked goods. When removed, bakers must find alternative ingredients to replicate these properties. Common substitutes include almond flour, coconut flour, and xanthan gum. These ingredients not only mimic the texture of gluten but also add unique flavors and nutritional benefits. Cincinnati's gluten-free bakeries have mastered this art, offering products that are both delicious and nutritious.</p>
