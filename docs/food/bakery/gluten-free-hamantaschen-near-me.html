    <h1>Gluten-Free Hamantaschen Near Me: A Delicious Guide</h1>

    <p>Hamantaschen, the iconic triangular pastries traditionally enjoyed during the Jewish holiday of Purim, are a beloved treat for many. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding gluten-free versions of these delightful pastries can be a challenge.

The shape of the pastry is said to resemble Haman's three-cornered hat, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil.</p>

    <p>For those who follow a gluten-free diet, the challenge lies in finding hamantaschen made with gluten-free flour. Traditional hamantaschen are made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, with the rise of gluten-free baking, many bakeries have started offering gluten-free versions that are just as delicious and satisfying.</p>
