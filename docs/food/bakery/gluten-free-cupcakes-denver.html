    <h2>Baking Your Own Gluten-Free Cupcakes</h2>
    <p>If you prefer baking at home, making gluten-free cupcakes is easier than you might think. The key is to use the right flour blend. Many gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, coconut flour, or a pre-mixed gluten-free flour blend, can be used as substitutes for traditional wheat flour. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Vanilla Cupcake Recipe</h3>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>½ tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¾ cup buttermilk</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a cupcake tin with paper liners.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly among the cupcake liners and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Let the cupcakes cool completely before frosting.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cupcakes</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Are gluten-free cupcakes healthier?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cupcakes are not inherently healthier than regular cupcakes. They are designed for individuals who need to avoid gluten due to health reasons. However, they can be made healthier by using natural sweeteners, whole-grain gluten-free flours, and reducing sugar content.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I find vegan gluten-free cupcakes in Denver?</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What’s the difference between gluten-free flour and regular flour?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free flour is made from grains, nuts, or starches that do not contain gluten, such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca starch. Regular flour is made from wheat, which contains gluten. Gluten-free flours often require additional binders, like xanthan gum, to mimic the texture of gluten.</p>
