    <h2>Baking Your Own Gluten-Free Cake</h2>
    <p>If you prefer to bake at home, making a gluten-free cake can be a fun and rewarding experience. Here are some tips to ensure your cake turns out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Gluten-free flours like almond, coconut, and rice flour are great alternatives. You can also use a pre-mixed gluten-free flour blend for convenience.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Binders:</strong> Since gluten provides structure, you’ll need to add binders like xanthan gum or psyllium husk to your batter to help hold the cake together.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix your ingredients just until they are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be enhanced with flavors like vanilla, citrus, or chocolate. Don’t be afraid to get creative!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Is gluten-free cake healthier than regular cake?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cake can be healthier for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, but it’s not inherently healthier for everyone. Gluten-free cakes often contain similar amounts of sugar and fat as regular cakes, so moderation is key.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I find gluten-free cake at regular bakeries?</h3>
        <p>Some regular bakeries offer gluten-free options, but it’s important to ask about cross-contamination if you have a severe gluten allergy. Dedicated gluten-free bakeries are the safest option.</p>

        <h3>3. What are the best gluten-free flours for baking?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour are popular choices for gluten-free baking. Each flour has its own unique texture and flavor, so you may need to experiment to find your favorite.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store gluten-free cake?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cakes can dry out faster than regular cakes, so it’s best to store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two days or in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>
