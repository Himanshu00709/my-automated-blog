    <h2>Baking Your Own Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>If you prefer to bake at home, making gluten-free cookies is easier than you might think. The key is to use the right flour blend and ingredients to achieve the perfect texture and flavor. Here are some tips for baking gluten-free cookies:</p>

    <h3>1. Choose the Right Flour</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour are excellent alternatives to traditional wheat flour. You can also find pre-mixed gluten-free flour blends at most grocery stores, which are specifically designed for baking.</p>

    <h3>2. Add Binders</h3>
    <p>Since gluten provides elasticity and structure to baked goods, you'll need to add binders like xanthan gum or psyllium husk to your gluten-free cookie dough. These ingredients help hold the cookies together and prevent them from crumbling.</p>

    <h3>3. Experiment with Flavors</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free baking opens up a world of flavor possibilities. Consider adding ingredients like dark chocolate chips, dried fruit, nuts, or spices to your cookie dough to create unique and delicious combinations.</p>
