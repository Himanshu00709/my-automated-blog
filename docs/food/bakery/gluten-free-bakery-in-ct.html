    <h1>Gluten-Free Bakery in CT: A Haven for Celiac and Gluten-Sensitive Foodies</h1>

    <p>Connecticut, known for its picturesque landscapes and vibrant food scene, is also home to a growing number of gluten-free bakeries. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding a bakery that caters to their dietary needs can be a challenge. Fortunately, Connecticut has embraced the gluten-free movement, offering a variety of bakeries that specialize in delicious, safe, and gluten-free treats. In this blog post, we’ll explore the best gluten-free bakeries in CT, what makes them stand out, and why they are a must-visit for anyone on a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Bakeries Matter</h2>

For these individuals, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free bakeries provide a safe haven where individuals can enjoy baked goods without the fear of cross-contamination. These bakeries use alternative flours like almond, coconut, and rice flour, ensuring that their products are not only safe but also delicious. In Connecticut, the demand for gluten-free options has led to the rise of several dedicated bakeries that cater to this growing market.</p>
