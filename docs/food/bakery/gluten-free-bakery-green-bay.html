    <h1>Gluten-Free Bakery in Green Bay: A Haven for Celiac and Gluten-Sensitive Individuals</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Green Bay, Wisconsin, is no exception to this trend. The city is home to a growing number of gluten-free bakeries that cater to individuals who need or choose to avoid gluten. These bakeries are not just about providing alternatives; they are about creating delicious, high-quality baked goods that everyone can enjoy. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free bakery scene in Green Bay, highlighting the best places to find gluten-free treats, the benefits of gluten-free baking, and what makes these bakeries stand out.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to skin rashes and even neurological problems. The only treatment for celiac disease is a strict gluten-free diet, which means avoiding all foods that contain gluten. This can be challenging, especially when it comes to baked goods, which traditionally rely on wheat flour. However, gluten-free bakeries have risen to the challenge, offering a wide range of products that are safe for those with gluten-related disorders.</p>

    <h2>Top Gluten-Free Bakeries in Green Bay</h2>

    <p>Green Bay is home to several excellent gluten-free bakeries that have earned a reputation for their quality and variety. Here are some of the top options:</p>

    <h2>What Makes These Bakeries Stand Out?</h2>

    <p>What sets these gluten-free bakeries apart is their commitment to quality and safety.
