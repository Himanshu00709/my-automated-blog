    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Baking</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking offers several benefits, both for those with dietary restrictions and for anyone looking to explore new culinary horizons. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Digestion:</strong> For individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, gluten-free baking can alleviate digestive issues and promote gut health.</li>
        <li><strong>Diverse Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free flours like almond, coconut, and rice flour bring unique flavors and textures to baked goods, making them more interesting and varied.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthier Ingredients:</strong> Many gluten-free recipes use whole, unprocessed ingredients, which can be healthier than traditional baking ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Gluten-free cakes allow everyone to enjoy dessert, regardless of dietary restrictions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for Making Gluten-Free Cakes at Home</h2>

    <p>If you're inspired to try your hand at gluten-free baking, here are some tips to help you get started:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Different gluten-free flours have different properties. Experiment with almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free flour blend to find the one that works best for your recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Binders:</strong> Gluten-free flours lack the binding properties of wheat flour, so you may need to add xanthan gum or psyllium husk to help your cake hold together.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense, heavy cake. Mix your batter just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Baking Time:</strong> Gluten-free cakes may require a slightly longer baking time than traditional cakes. Keep an eye on your cake and test it with a toothpick to ensure it's done.</li>
    </ol>
