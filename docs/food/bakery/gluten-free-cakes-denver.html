    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Baking</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking isn't just about avoiding gluten; it's also about exploring new ingredients and flavors. Here are some of the benefits of gluten-free baking:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diverse Ingredients:</strong> Gluten-free baking often involves using alternative flours like almond, coconut, or rice flour, which can add unique flavors and textures to your cakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthier Options:</strong> Many gluten-free flours are naturally higher in protein and fiber, making your cakes not only delicious but also more nutritious.</li>
        <li><strong>Allergy-Friendly:</strong> Gluten-free cakes are often free from other common allergens like dairy and nuts, making them a great option for people with multiple food sensitivities.</li>
        <li><strong>Creative Freedom:</strong> Gluten-free baking encourages creativity, allowing you to experiment with new recipes and ingredients.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for Making Gluten-Free Cakes at Home</h2>

    <p>If you're interested in making your own gluten-free cakes at home, here are some tips to get you started:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Experiment with different types to find the one that works best for your recipe. Almond flour is great for moist cakes, while rice flour works well for lighter, fluffier cakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Binders:</strong> Gluten-free flours lack the binding properties of wheat flour, so you'll need to add binders like xanthan gum or psyllium husk to help your cake hold together.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense, tough cakes. Mix your batter just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Moisture-Rich Ingredients:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can dry out quickly, so be sure to include moisture-rich ingredients like applesauce, yogurt, or mashed bananas in your recipes.</li>
        <li><strong>Let It Cool:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be more delicate than traditional cakes, so let them cool completely before removing them from the pan.</li>
    </ol>
