    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Cupcakes?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free cupcakes are not just for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Many people choose gluten-free options for various reasons, including dietary preferences, health benefits, or simply to try something new. Gluten-free cupcakes are made with alternative flours such as almond flour, rice flour, or coconut flour, which can offer a unique texture and flavor profile. Additionally, gluten-free baking often incorporates more whole, natural ingredients, making these treats a healthier option for many.</p>

    <h2>Baking Your Own Gluten-Free Cupcakes</h2>
    <p>If you're feeling adventurous, baking your own gluten-free cupcakes can be a rewarding experience. Here are some tips to get you started:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Gluten-free flours like almond, rice, or coconut flour are great alternatives. You can also use a gluten-free flour blend for a more traditional texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Binders:</strong> Since gluten provides structure, you'll need to add binders like xanthan gum or psyllium husk to your batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free baking allows for a lot of creativity. Try adding flavors like vanilla, chocolate, or citrus to your cupcakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cupcakes. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    </ul>
