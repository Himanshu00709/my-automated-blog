<h1>Gluten-Free Challah Near Me: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Challah, the traditional Jewish bread, is a staple during Shabbat and other Jewish holidays. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying this delicious bread can be a challenge.

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Challah at Home</h2>

<p>If you’re unable to find gluten-free challah near you, or if you simply enjoy baking, making gluten-free challah at home is a great option. Here’s a basic recipe to get you started:</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
    <li>1/2 cup almond flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup tapioca flour</li>
    <li>1 packet active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, tapioca flour, yeast, sugar, and salt.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and warm water.</li>
    <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into three equal parts and roll each part into a long rope. Braid the ropes together to form a challah loaf.</li>

    <li>Let the challah cool before slicing and serving.</li>
</ol>
