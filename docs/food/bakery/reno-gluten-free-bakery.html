    <h2>The Science Behind Gluten-Free Baking</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking is a science in itself. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, provides elasticity and structure to baked goods. When removed, bakers must find alternative ways to achieve the same texture and consistency. Reno Gluten-Free Bakery excels in this area by using a combination of gluten-free flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, and tapioca starch. These ingredients not only mimic the texture of gluten but also add unique flavors and nutritional benefits.</p>

    <h3>Nutritional Benefits</h3>
    <p>Many of the ingredients used in gluten-free baking are naturally nutrient-dense. For example, almond flour is rich in healthy fats, protein, and vitamin E, while coconut flour is high in fiber and low in carbohydrates. By incorporating these ingredients, Reno Gluten-Free Bakery not only caters to those with dietary restrictions but also offers healthier options for everyone.</p>

    <h2>Customer Experience</h2>

The aroma of freshly baked goods fills the air, and the friendly staff are always ready to assist with recommendations or answer any questions.
