    <h1>Gluten-Free Bakery in Erie, PA: A Haven for Celiac and Gluten-Sensitive Individuals</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Erie, Pennsylvania, is no exception to this trend. The city is home to a growing number of gluten-free bakeries that cater to individuals who need or choose to avoid gluten. These bakeries offer a wide range of delicious, safe, and nutritious baked goods that allow everyone to enjoy the pleasures of bread, pastries, and desserts without the worry of gluten-related health issues.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Matters</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, consuming gluten is harmless. However, for individuals with celiac disease, gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to a host of health problems. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity, another condition, can cause symptoms like bloating, headaches, and fatigue. For these individuals, a gluten-free diet is not a choice but a necessity. Gluten-free bakeries in Erie, PA, play a crucial role in providing safe and delicious options for those who must avoid gluten.</p>
