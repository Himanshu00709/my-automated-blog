    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Cupcake?</h2>
    <p>A great gluten-free cupcake is more than just the absence of gluten. It should be moist, flavorful, and have a texture that rivals traditional cupcakes. Here are some key factors that contribute to a delicious gluten-free cupcake:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality Ingredients:</strong> Using high-quality gluten-free flours, such as almond flour or rice flour, can make a significant difference in taste and texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Moisture:</strong> Gluten-free baked goods can sometimes be dry, so adding ingredients like applesauce, yogurt, or extra eggs can help retain moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> Incorporating natural flavors like vanilla, citrus zest, or spices can enhance the overall taste of the cupcake.</li>
        <li><strong>Frosting:</strong> A good frosting can elevate a gluten-free cupcake. Cream cheese, buttercream, or ganache are popular choices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>DIY Gluten-Free Cupcakes: Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <p>If you're feeling adventurous, why not try making your own gluten-free cupcakes at home? Here are some tips to ensure your homemade cupcakes turn out perfectly:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Experiment with blends like almond flour, coconut flour, or a pre-mixed gluten-free flour blend.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cupcakes. Mix until just combined to keep them light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Binder:</strong> Since gluten provides structure, you'll need a binder like xanthan gum or psyllium husk to help hold the cupcakes together.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake at the Right Temperature:</strong> Gluten-free cupcakes may require a slightly lower baking temperature to prevent them from drying out.</li>
    </ol>
