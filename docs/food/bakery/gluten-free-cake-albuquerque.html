    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Cake?</h2>
    <p>A great gluten-free cake is more than just the absence of gluten. It should be moist, flavorful, and have a texture that rivals traditional cakes. Here are some key factors that contribute to a delicious gluten-free cake:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality Ingredients:</strong> Using high-quality, fresh ingredients is essential. Almond flour, coconut flour, and tapioca starch are popular gluten-free alternatives that provide excellent texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Proper Moisture Balance:</strong> Gluten-free flours can be drier than wheat flour, so it's important to balance the moisture with ingredients like applesauce, yogurt, or extra eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavor Enhancements:</strong> Adding natural flavor enhancers like vanilla extract, citrus zest, or spices can elevate the taste of your gluten-free cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Achieving the right texture is crucial. Xanthan gum or guar gum can help mimic the elasticity that gluten provides, giving your cake a more traditional feel.</li>
