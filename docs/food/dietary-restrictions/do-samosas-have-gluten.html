    <h1>Do Samosas Have Gluten? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Samosas are a beloved snack in many parts of the world, known for their crispy exterior and flavorful fillings. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether samosas contain gluten is crucial. In this article, we will explore the ingredients typically used in samosas, discuss gluten content, and provide alternatives for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What Are Samosas?</h2>
    <p>Samosas are a popular savory pastry that originated in the Middle East and Central Asia but have become a staple in South Asian cuisine. They are typically made by wrapping a thin layer of dough around a spiced filling, which often includes potatoes, peas, lentils, or minced meat. The filled dough is then deep-fried or baked until golden and crispy.</p>

    <h2>Do Traditional Samosas Contain Gluten?</h2>
    <p>The primary concern for those avoiding gluten lies in the dough used to make samosas. Traditional samosa dough is made from wheat flour, which contains gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it gives the dough its elasticity and structure. Therefore, traditional samosas are not gluten-free.</p>
