<h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Taco Dip</h2>

<p>While many taco dip ingredients are naturally gluten-free, there are a few potential sources of gluten to watch out for:</p>

<ul>

    <li><strong>Thickeners and Additives:</strong> Some store-bought salsas, sour creams, or cream cheeses may contain thickeners or stabilizers derived from gluten. Always read ingredient lists carefully.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If taco dip is prepared in a kitchen that also handles gluten-containing foods, cross-contamination is a risk. Use separate utensils and surfaces to avoid this issue.</li>
</ul>
