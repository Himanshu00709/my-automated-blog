    <h1>Is DQ Soft Serve Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Dairy Queen (DQ) is a beloved fast-food chain known for its creamy soft-serve ice cream and a variety of frozen treats. For individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, navigating the menu can be a challenge. One of the most common questions is: <strong>Is DQ soft serve gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, preparation methods, and potential cross-contamination risks to help you make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to long-term health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial to understand whether DQ soft serve contains gluten or is at risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in DQ Soft Serve</h2>

    <p>According to Dairy Queen, their soft-serve ice cream is made from a blend of milk, sugar, cream, and other natural flavors. The company states that their soft-serve mix does not contain gluten-containing ingredients. However, it’s important to note that while the base ingredients may be gluten-free, the risk of cross-contamination during production or serving cannot be entirely ruled out.</p>
