    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Fondue Pot:</strong> Rub the inside of the fondue pot with the garlic clove to infuse it with flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Wine or Broth:</strong> Pour the wine or broth into the pot and heat it gently over medium heat until it starts to simmer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Cheese:</strong> Gradually add the grated cheese to the pot, stirring constantly until the cheese is fully melted and the mixture is smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Thicken the Mixture:</strong> In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch or gluten-free flour with a little cold water to create a slurry. Add this to the cheese mixture and stir until the fondue thickens.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Lemon Juice:</strong> Stir in the lemon juice to balance the flavors.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Fondue</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free fondue is a success, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Cheese:</strong> Opt for naturally gluten-free cheeses like Gruyère or Emmental. Avoid processed cheeses that may contain gluten additives.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Your Wine:</strong> Some wines may contain trace amounts of gluten due to the fining process. Look for wines labeled gluten-free or use a gluten-free broth as an alternative.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh, high-quality ingredients will yield the best results. Avoid pre-shredded cheeses, as they often contain anti-caking agents that may include gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Dippers:</strong> While gluten-free bread is a classic choice, don’t be afraid to get creative with your dippers. Try vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, or bell peppers, or even fruits like apples or pears.</li>
    </ul>
