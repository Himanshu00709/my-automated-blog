    <h1>Dairy and Gluten-Free Shortbread: A Delicious Alternative</h1>

    <p>Shortbread is a classic treat that has been enjoyed for centuries. Its rich, buttery flavor and crumbly texture make it a favorite among cookie lovers. However, for those with dietary restrictions, such as lactose intolerance or celiac disease, traditional shortbread can be off-limits. Fortunately, with the rise of alternative ingredients, it's now possible to enjoy dairy and gluten-free shortbread that is just as delicious as the original. In this article, we'll explore the world of dairy and gluten-free shortbread, including its benefits, how to make it, and some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Dairy and Gluten-Free Shortbread?</h2>

    <p>Dairy and gluten-free shortbread is not just for those with dietary restrictions. Many people choose to avoid dairy and gluten for various health reasons, including digestive issues, inflammation, or simply to adopt a healthier lifestyle. By using alternative ingredients, you can create a shortbread that is not only safe for those with allergies or intolerances but also packed with nutrients. For example, using almond flour instead of traditional wheat flour can add a boost of protein and healthy fats, while coconut oil can replace butter to provide a dairy-free option that is rich in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are known for their energy-boosting properties.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Dairy and Gluten-Free Shortbread</h2>

    <p>Making dairy and gluten-free shortbread is surprisingly simple. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating your own batch:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your shortbread will bake evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine your chosen gluten-free flour, sugar, and a pinch of salt. If you're using almond flour, you may need to add a binding agent like xanthan gum to help the dough hold together.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the fat:</strong> Cut in your chosen fat (coconut oil, vegan butter, etc.) until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. You can use a pastry cutter or your hands for this step.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the dough:</strong> Press the dough into a greased baking dish or roll it out and cut it into shapes. If the dough is too crumbly, you can add a small amount of water or non-dairy milk to help it come together.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the shortbread for 15-20 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake, as gluten-free flours can brown quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the shortbread to cool completely before cutting or serving. This will help it set and achieve the perfect crumbly texture.</li>
    </ol>
