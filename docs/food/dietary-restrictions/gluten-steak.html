    <h1>Gluten Steak: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Gluten steak, often referred to as seitan steak, is a popular plant-based protein alternative that has gained significant attention in recent years. Made primarily from wheat gluten, this meat substitute offers a chewy, meat-like texture that makes it a favorite among vegetarians, vegans, and even meat-eaters looking to reduce their meat consumption. In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about gluten steak, from its nutritional benefits to how you can prepare it at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten Steak?</h2>
    <p>Gluten steak is a meat substitute made from wheat gluten, the main protein found in wheat. It is created by washing wheat flour dough with water until all the starch granules are removed, leaving behind the sticky, elastic gluten. This gluten is then seasoned, cooked, and often shaped into steaks or other meat-like forms. The result is a high-protein, low-fat product that closely mimics the texture of meat.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten Steak</h2>
    <p>Gluten steak is not only a versatile meat alternative but also a nutritious one. Here are some of the key nutritional benefits:</p>
