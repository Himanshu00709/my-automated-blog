    <h1>Dairy and Gluten-Free Candy: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with dietary restrictions, finding delicious and safe treats can be a challenge. Whether you're lactose intolerant, have celiac disease, or simply prefer to avoid dairy and gluten, the world of candy can seem like a minefield.
