<h1>Understanding Gluten and Egg-Free Diets: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, gluten-free and egg-free diets have gained significant attention, not only among individuals with specific dietary restrictions but also among those seeking healthier lifestyle choices. Whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, egg allergies, or personal preferences, understanding these diets is crucial for maintaining a balanced and nutritious lifestyle. This article delves into the intricacies of gluten and egg-free diets, offering insights, tips, and practical advice for those navigating these dietary paths.</p>

<h2>What Does Gluten-Free Mean?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even small amounts of gluten can cause symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. A gluten-free diet eliminates all foods containing gluten, focusing instead on naturally gluten-free foods like fruits, vegetables, meats, and certain grains.</p>

This diet is essential for individuals with egg allergies, which can cause severe reactions such as hives, swelling, and even anaphylaxis. Additionally, some people choose an egg-free diet for ethical or environmental reasons.</p>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I still bake without gluten and eggs?</h3>
