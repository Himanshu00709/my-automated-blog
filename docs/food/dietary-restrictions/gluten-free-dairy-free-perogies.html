    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of gluten-free flour blend with 1 teaspoon of xanthan gum. Gradually add 1 cup of dairy-free milk and 2 tablespoons of olive oil, mixing until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface until it becomes smooth and elastic. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. Boil 2 large potatoes until tender, then mash them. In a skillet, sauté 1 finely chopped onion until translucent. Mix the mashed potatoes, sautéed onions, and 1/2 cup of dairy-free cheese in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Perogies</h3>
    <p>Roll out the dough on a floured surface until it’s about 1/8 inch thick. Use a round cookie cutter or glass to cut out circles. Place a small spoonful of the filling in the center of each circle, fold the dough over to form a half-moon shape, and press the edges to seal. You can use a fork to crimp the edges for a decorative touch.</p>

    <h3>4. Cook the Perogies</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully drop the perogies into the boiling water and cook until they float to the surface, about 3-4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside. For a crispy texture, you can pan-fry the boiled perogies in a bit of olive oil until golden brown.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free dairy-free perogies can be served in a variety of ways. Here are a few ideas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Classic Style:</strong> Serve with sautéed onions and a dollop of dairy-free sour cream.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthy Option:</strong> Pair with a fresh green salad and a light vinaigrette.</li>
        <li><strong>Comfort Food:</strong> Top with a rich mushroom gravy for a hearty meal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free dairy-free perogies?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze them! After assembling the perogies, place them on a baking sheet in a single layer and freeze until solid. Once frozen, transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container. They can be cooked directly from frozen by boiling or pan-frying.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour for perogies?</h3>
        <p>A blend of gluten-free flours works best for perogies. Look for a pre-made gluten-free flour blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch. This combination provides the right texture and elasticity for the dough.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the dough up to a day in advance. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator. Let it come to room temperature before rolling it out.</p>

        <h3>Are gluten-free dairy-free perogies healthy?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free dairy-free perogies can be a healthy option, especially if you use whole, unprocessed ingredients. They are naturally free from gluten and dairy, making them suitable for those with dietary restrictions. However, like any comfort food, moderation is key.</p>
