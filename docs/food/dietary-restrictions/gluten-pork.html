        <li><strong>Combine and Cook:</strong> Once the gluten and pork are prepared, combine them in a pan or wok. Add additional seasonings and sauces, such as oyster sauce or hoisin sauce, and stir-fry until everything is well-cooked and flavorful.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Gluten pork can be served with rice, noodles, or vegetables. It is a versatile dish that can be adapted to various cuisines and preferences.</li>
    </ol>
