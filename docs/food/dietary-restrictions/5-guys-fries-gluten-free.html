    <h1>Are Five Guys Fries Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>
    <p>Five Guys is a popular fast-food chain known for its delicious burgers, hot dogs, and, of course, its famous fries. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Five Guys fries are gluten-free is a critical one. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, preparation methods, and potential cross-contamination risks to help you make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s essential to know whether the foods you eat contain gluten or are at risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Are Five Guys Fries Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>According to Five Guys, their fries are gluten-free. The fries are made from fresh, hand-cut potatoes and cooked in 100% peanut oil. The ingredients list for Five Guys fries is simple: potatoes, peanut oil, and salt. None of these ingredients contain gluten, making the fries inherently gluten-free.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients Breakdown</h3>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free?</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Potatoes</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Peanut Oil</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>
    <p>While the ingredients in Five Guys fries are gluten-free, cross-contamination is a potential concern. Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods or surfaces. At Five Guys, the fries are cooked in dedicated fryers, separate from any gluten-containing items like breaded chicken or onion rings. This significantly reduces the risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <h3>Five Guys' Commitment to Gluten-Free Options</h3>
    <p>Five Guys takes gluten-free dining seriously. They have a clear policy of using separate fryers for their fries, ensuring that they remain gluten-free. Additionally, Five Guys provides detailed allergen information on their website, allowing customers to make informed choices about their meals.</p>

They appreciate the transparency in ingredient sourcing and the dedicated fryers. However, it’s always a good idea to communicate with the staff at your local Five Guys to ensure that the fries are prepared safely for your dietary needs.</p>
