    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Shumai</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free shumai at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create this delicious dish:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Wrapper</h3>

    <p>Start by making the gluten-free wrapper. Combine gluten-free flour, water, and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic. Roll out the dough into thin circles, ensuring they are large enough to hold the filling.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>

    <p>In a separate bowl, mix together the ground pork, shrimp, chopped shiitake mushrooms, green onions, gluten-free soy sauce, sesame oil, and cornstarch. Ensure the mixture is well combined and has a slightly sticky consistency.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Shumai</h3>

    <p>Place a small amount of the filling in the center of each wrapper. Gently gather the edges of the wrapper around the filling, leaving the top exposed. Press the edges together to seal the dumpling, ensuring it holds its shape.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Steam the Shumai</h3>

    <p>Arrange the shumai in a steamer basket, making sure they are not touching each other. Steam the dumplings for about 10-12 minutes, or until the filling is cooked through and the wrapper is tender.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once the shumai are cooked, remove them from the steamer and serve immediately. They can be enjoyed on their own or with a gluten-free dipping sauce, such as a mixture of gluten-free soy sauce, rice vinegar, and a touch of chili oil.</p>
