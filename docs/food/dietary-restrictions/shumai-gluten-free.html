    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Shumai</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free shumai at home is easier than you might think. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create this delicious dish:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Filling</h3>

    <p>Start by preparing the filling. Combine ground pork, finely chopped shrimp, minced garlic, grated ginger, and your choice of seasonings in a bowl. Mix well until the ingredients are evenly distributed. You can also add finely chopped vegetables like mushrooms or water chestnuts for added texture and flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Gluten-Free Wrappers</h3>

    <p>If you're using store-bought gluten-free wrappers, make sure they are at room temperature before using. If you prefer to make your own wrappers, mix rice flour, tapioca starch, and water to form a dough. Roll out the dough into thin circles, ensuring they are large enough to hold the filling.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Shumai</h3>

    <p>Place a small amount of filling in the center of each wrapper. Gather the edges of the wrapper around the filling, leaving the top exposed. Gently press the shumai to form a cup shape, ensuring the filling is secure.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Steam the Shumai</h3>

    <p>Arrange the shumai in a steamer basket, making sure they are not touching each other. Steam for about 10-12 minutes, or until the filling is cooked through and the wrappers are tender. Serve hot with gluten-free dipping sauce.</p>
