    <h1>Summer Gluten: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>As summer approaches, many of us look forward to outdoor barbecues, picnics, and beachside snacks. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, navigating summer foods can be a challenge. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, is a common ingredient in many summer staples like burgers, hot dogs, and pasta salads. But fear not! This guide will help you enjoy a gluten-free summer without compromising on taste or fun.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein that gives dough its elasticity and helps it rise. While it's harmless for most people, it can cause serious health issues for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Gluten sensitivity, on the other hand, can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue without the intestinal damage seen in celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Summer Foods</h2>
    <p>Summer is the perfect time to explore fresh, naturally gluten-free foods. Here are some delicious options:</p>
