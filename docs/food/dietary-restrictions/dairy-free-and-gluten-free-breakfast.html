    <h2>Why Choose Dairy-Free and Gluten-Free Breakfasts?</h2>
    <p>Dairy-free and gluten-free diets have gained popularity for various reasons. Some people avoid dairy due to lactose intolerance or a sensitivity to casein, while others eliminate gluten because of celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Both diets can also be part of a broader approach to reduce inflammation, improve digestion, and promote overall health. A well-planned dairy-free and gluten-free breakfast can provide essential nutrients, energy, and satisfaction without compromising on taste.</p>

    <p>Chia pudding is a simple yet satisfying breakfast. Mix chia seeds with dairy-free milk and let it sit overnight. In the morning, top with fresh fruit, nuts, or a drizzle of honey. It's rich in omega-3 fatty acids and fiber, making it a great way to start your day.</p>

    <h3>4. Gluten-Free Pancakes</h3>
