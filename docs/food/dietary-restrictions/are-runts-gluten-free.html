    <h1>Are Runts Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Runts, the colorful, fruit-shaped candies that have been a favorite among candy lovers for decades, are known for their vibrant colors and tangy flavors. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Runts are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential risks associated with Runts to determine if they are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Runts Made Of?</h2>

    <p>Runts are small, fruit-shaped candies that come in a variety of flavors, including banana, cherry, grape, orange, and strawberry. They are known for their hard candy shell and slightly tangy taste. The primary ingredients in Runts include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Corn syrup</li>
        <li>Malic acid</li>
        <li>Dextrose</li>
        <li>Artificial flavors</li>
        <li>Artificial colors (such as Red 40, Yellow 5, and Blue 1)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, these ingredients do not contain gluten. However, it’s important to consider the manufacturing process and potential cross-contamination risks.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Sources</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is commonly found in bread, pasta, cereals, and many processed foods. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, even trace amounts of gluten can cause adverse health effects, including digestive issues, skin rashes, and long-term damage to the small intestine.</p>

    <p>When evaluating whether a product like Runts is gluten-free, it’s essential to look beyond the ingredient list and consider the following factors:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Factor</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Ingredient Sourcing</td>
                <td>Are the ingredients sourced from gluten-free suppliers?</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Manufacturing Process</td>
                <td>Is the product manufactured in a facility that also processes gluten-containing products?</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cross-Contamination</td>
                <td>Is there a risk of cross-contamination during production, packaging, or transportation?</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Are Runts Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Based on the ingredient list, Runts do not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, the manufacturing process is a critical factor to consider. Runts are produced by Ferrara Candy Company, which also manufactures other candies that may contain gluten. This raises the possibility of cross-contamination during production.</p>

    <p>Ferrara Candy Company does not explicitly label Runts as gluten-free. While the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, the lack of a gluten-free certification means that there is a potential risk of cross-contamination. For individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, this could be a concern.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Candy Alternatives</h2>

    <p>If you’re looking for gluten-free candy options, there are several alternatives to Runts that are certified gluten-free. Here are a few popular choices:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Candy</th>
                <th>Brand</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Certification</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Skittles</td>
                <td>Mars Wrigley</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Starburst</td>
                <td>Mars Wrigley</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Jelly Belly</td>
                <td>Jelly Belly Candy Company</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Swedish Fish</td>
                <td>Mondelez International</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>These candies are produced in facilities that either do not process gluten-containing products or have strict protocols in place to prevent cross-contamination. Always check the packaging for gluten-free certification to ensure safety.</p>
