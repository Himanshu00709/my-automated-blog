    <h1>Gluten-Free Okonomiyaki: A Delicious Japanese Delight</h1>

    <p>Okonomiyaki, often referred to as a "Japanese savory pancake," is a beloved dish in Japan that combines a variety of ingredients into a flavorful and satisfying meal. Traditionally, okonomiyaki is made with wheat flour, which poses a challenge for those following a gluten-free diet. However, with a few simple substitutions, you can enjoy this delicious dish without compromising your dietary needs. In this article, we'll explore the world of gluten-free okonomiyaki, from its origins to how you can make it at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Okonomiyaki?</h2>

    <p>Okonomiyaki is a versatile dish that originated in Japan and has since gained popularity worldwide. The name "okonomiyaki" translates to "grilled as you like it," which reflects the customizable nature of the dish. It typically consists of a batter made from flour, eggs, and shredded cabbage, which is then mixed with various ingredients such as meat, seafood, or vegetables. The mixture is cooked on a griddle and topped with a variety of condiments, including okonomiyaki sauce, mayonnaise, and bonito flakes.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those who simply choose to avoid gluten for health reasons, traditional okonomiyaki is off the menu.

Fortunately, gluten-free alternatives allow everyone to enjoy this delightful dish without worry.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Okonomiyaki</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your gluten-free ingredients, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free okonomiyaki at home.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of gluten-free flour, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder. Gradually add 3/4 cup of water or dashi (Japanese soup stock) and mix until smooth. Crack in 2 eggs and whisk until fully incorporated. Finally, fold in 2 cups of finely shredded cabbage and any additional ingredients you like, such as diced onions, grated carrots, or cooked shrimp.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Okonomiyaki</h3>

    <p>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with oil. Pour a portion of the batter onto the skillet, forming a round pancake. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Repeat with the remaining batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Toppings</h3>

    <p>Once your okonomiyaki is cooked, it's time to add the toppings. Drizzle gluten-free okonomiyaki sauce and mayonnaise over the top, then sprinkle with bonito flakes and aonori (dried seaweed flakes). You can also add a fried egg on top for an extra layer of flavor.</p>
