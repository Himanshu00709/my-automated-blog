<h1>Dairy-Free and Gluten-Free Candy: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with dietary restrictions, finding delicious and safe treats can be a challenge. Whether you're lactose intolerant, have a gluten sensitivity, or follow a vegan lifestyle, the world of candy doesn't have to be off-limits. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the best dairy-free and gluten-free candy options available, how to identify them, and why they might be the perfect choice for you.</p>

<h2>Understanding Dairy-Free and Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

<p>Before diving into the world of dairy-free and gluten-free candy, it's essential to understand what these terms mean. A dairy-free diet excludes all forms of dairy, including milk, cheese, butter, and yogurt. This is crucial for those who are lactose intolerant or have a milk allergy. On the other hand, a gluten-free diet eliminates gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. This is necessary for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

<p>When it comes to candy, many traditional options contain hidden dairy or gluten ingredients. For example, milk chocolate is a common ingredient in many candies, and some gummy candies use wheat-based starches. Therefore, it's essential to read labels carefully and look for certified dairy-free and gluten-free products.</p>

<h2>How to Identify Dairy-Free and Gluten-Free Candy</h2>

<p>Identifying dairy-free and gluten-free candy can be tricky, especially when dealing with unfamiliar brands or products. Here are some tips to help you make informed choices:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Read the Ingredients List:</strong> Always check the ingredients list for any hidden dairy or gluten. Look for terms like "milk," "whey," "casein," "barley," and "rye."</li>
    <li><strong>Look for Certifications:</strong> Many brands will have certifications such as "Certified Gluten-Free" or "Dairy-Free" on their packaging. These certifications provide an extra layer of assurance.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Cross-Contamination:</strong> Some candies may be made in facilities that also process dairy or gluten-containing products. Look for statements like "May contain traces of milk or wheat" if you're highly sensitive.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Apps and Websites:</strong> There are several apps and websites dedicated to helping people find dairy-free and gluten-free products. Apps like "Gluten-Free Scanner" or websites like "Go Dairy Free" can be invaluable resources.</li>
