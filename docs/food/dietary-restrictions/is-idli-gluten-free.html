    <h1>Is Idli Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Idli, a traditional South Indian dish, is a staple in many households across India and beyond. Known for its soft, fluffy texture and mild flavor, idli is often enjoyed as a breakfast item or a light snack. But for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Is idli gluten-free?</strong> In this article, we will delve into the ingredients and preparation of idli, explore its gluten content, and provide tips for making gluten-free idli at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Idli?</h2>

    <p>Idli is a steamed rice cake made from a fermented batter consisting of rice and urad dal (black gram). The batter is left to ferment overnight, which gives idli its characteristic tangy flavor and airy texture. Traditionally, idli is served with coconut chutney, sambar, or other accompaniments. It is a popular dish not only for its taste but also for its health benefits, as it is low in fat and easy to digest.</p>

    <h2>Is Idli Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The primary ingredients in idli—rice and urad dal—are naturally gluten-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. Since idli does not contain any of these grains, it is generally considered gluten-free. However, there are a few factors to consider:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If the idli batter is prepared in a kitchen where gluten-containing products are also made, there is a risk of cross-contamination. This can happen through shared utensils, surfaces, or even the air.</li>
        <li><strong>Additives:</strong> Some commercially prepared idli mixes or batters may contain additives or preservatives that could introduce gluten. Always check the label if you are using a store-bought mix.</li>
        <li><strong>Accompaniments:</strong> While idli itself is gluten-free, the accompaniments like chutneys or sambar may contain gluten if they are made with wheat-based ingredients or contaminated during preparation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Ensure Your Idli is Gluten-Free</h2>

    <p>If you are preparing idli at home and want to ensure it is gluten-free, follow these tips:</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular rice instead of idli rice?</h3>
