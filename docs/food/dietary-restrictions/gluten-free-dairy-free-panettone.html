    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Panettone at Home</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free dairy-free panettone at home is a rewarding experience. While it requires some patience, the result is a delicious, allergen-friendly treat that everyone can enjoy. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by mixing your gluten-free flour blend with a binding agent like xanthan gum to mimic the elasticity of gluten. Combine this with plant-based milk, a natural sweetener, and an egg replacer. Mix until a smooth dough forms.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add Flavorings</h3>
    <p>Incorporate your choice of dried fruits, nuts, and any additional flavorings like vanilla extract or citrus zest. Fold these ingredients gently into the dough to ensure even distribution.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Proof the Dough</h3>
    <p>Allow the dough to rise in a warm place. This step is crucial for achieving the light, airy texture that panettone is known for. Depending on the recipe, this may take several hours.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, transfer it to a panettone mold or a tall, round baking tin. Bake in a preheated oven until the top is golden brown and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the panettone to cool completely before slicing. Serve it as is, or with a drizzle of dairy-free chocolate or a dollop of coconut whipped cream for an extra indulgent touch.</p>
