<h1>Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Candy List: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with dietary restrictions, finding the right candy can be a challenge. Whether you're avoiding gluten due to celiac disease or steering clear of dairy due to lactose intolerance or a vegan lifestyle, it's essential to know which candies are safe to consume. This guide provides a detailed list of gluten-free and dairy-free candies, along with tips on how to identify them and answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

<h2>Why Gluten-Free and Dairy-Free Candy?</h2>

<p>Gluten and dairy are common allergens and can cause adverse reactions in sensitive individuals. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can trigger symptoms in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Dairy, on the other hand, contains lactose, which can be difficult to digest for those with lactose intolerance. Additionally, many people choose to avoid dairy for ethical or health reasons, such as following a vegan diet. Fortunately, there are plenty of candy options that cater to these dietary needs.</p>
