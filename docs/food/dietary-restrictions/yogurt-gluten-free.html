    <h1>Yogurt and Gluten-Free Diets: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Yogurt has long been celebrated as a nutritious and versatile food, packed with probiotics, calcium, and protein. However, for individuals following a gluten-free diet, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, the question of whether yogurt is safe to consume can be a bit more complicated. In this article, we’ll explore the relationship between yogurt and gluten-free diets, delve into the types of yogurt that are safe, and provide tips for making informed choices.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Avoid It?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to a range of symptoms and long-term health complications. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy are other conditions that may necessitate a gluten-free diet. Even for those without these conditions, some choose to avoid gluten for perceived health benefits.</p>

    <h2>Is Yogurt Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Plain, unflavored yogurt made from milk and live cultures is naturally gluten-free. However, the story doesn’t end there. Many commercial yogurts contain additives, flavorings, or mix-ins that may introduce gluten into the product. For example, yogurt with granola, cookie pieces, or certain thickeners may not be safe for those avoiding gluten. Therefore, it’s essential to read labels carefully and understand the potential sources of gluten in yogurt products.</p>

    <h2>Types of Yogurt and Gluten Content</h2>

    <p>Below is a table summarizing the gluten content of various types of yogurt:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Type of Yogurt</th>

        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Plain Yogurt</td>
