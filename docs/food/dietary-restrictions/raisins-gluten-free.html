    <h1>Are Raisins Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Raisins are a popular snack and ingredient in many dishes, known for their natural sweetness and nutritional benefits. But for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether raisins are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of raisins, their nutritional profile, and how to safely incorporate them into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Raisins?</h2>

    <p>Raisins are dried grapes, typically made from varieties like Thompson Seedless, Flame, or Muscat. The drying process concentrates the sugars and nutrients, making raisins a nutrient-dense food. They are commonly used in baking, cooking, and as a standalone snack.</p>

    <h2>Are Raisins Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, raisins are naturally gluten-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. Since raisins are made from grapes, which do not contain gluten, they are inherently safe for those avoiding gluten. However, cross-contamination can occur during processing or packaging, so it's essential to choose brands that certify their products as gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Raisins</h2>

    <p>Raisins are not only gluten-free but also packed with essential nutrients. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of their nutritional profile:</p>
