    <h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Candy: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with dietary restrictions, finding delicious and safe treats can be a challenge. Whether you're avoiding gluten due to celiac disease or steering clear of dairy because of lactose intolerance or a milk allergy, the world of candy can seem like a minefield. However, there are plenty of gluten and dairy-free candy options available that allow you to indulge without worry. In this guide, we'll explore some of the best gluten and dairy-free candies, provide tips for identifying safe options, and answer common questions about these dietary restrictions.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Dairy-Free Diets</h2>

    <p>Before diving into the list of candies, it's important to understand what it means for a product to be gluten and dairy-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause serious health issues for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Dairy, on the other hand, refers to products derived from milk, which can be problematic for those with lactose intolerance or milk allergies. When it comes to candy, both gluten and dairy can be hidden in ingredients like flavorings, colorings, or even the manufacturing process.</p>

    <h2>Top Gluten and Dairy-Free Candy Options</h2>

    <p>Here’s a curated list of popular gluten and dairy-free candies that you can enjoy without worry. Always remember to check the packaging for the most up-to-date ingredient information, as formulations can change.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Identifying Gluten and Dairy-Free Candy</h2>

    <p>When shopping for gluten and dairy-free candy, it's essential to be vigilant about reading labels. Here are some tips to help you identify safe options:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check for Certification:</strong> Look for certifications like "Gluten-Free" or "Dairy-Free" on the packaging. These labels indicate that the product has been tested and meets specific standards.</li>

        <li><strong>Beware of Cross-Contamination:</strong> Some candies may be made in facilities that also process gluten or dairy-containing products. Look for statements like "May contain traces of milk or wheat" to avoid cross-contamination risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Research Brands:</strong> Some brands are known for their commitment to allergen-free products. Familiarize yourself with these brands to make shopping easier.</li>
    </ul>
