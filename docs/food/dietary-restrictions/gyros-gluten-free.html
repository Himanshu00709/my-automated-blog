    <h1>Gyros Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Gyros, a beloved Mediterranean dish, has gained immense popularity worldwide for its flavorful combination of meat, vegetables, and sauces wrapped in a soft pita bread. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying traditional gyros can be a challenge due to the gluten content in the pita. Fortunately, with the rise of gluten-free alternatives, it’s now possible to savor this delicious dish without compromising your health. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free gyros, from ingredients to preparation tips, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Gyros Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Traditional gyros are made with pita bread, which typically contains gluten. To make gyros gluten-free, the key is to replace the pita with a gluten-free alternative. Additionally, you need to ensure that all other ingredients, including the meat, seasonings, and sauces, are free from gluten. Here’s a breakdown of the essential components of gluten-free gyros:</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Pita Bread</h3>
    <p>The foundation of any gyro is the bread. Fortunately, there are several gluten-free pita options available in stores or recipes you can make at home. These are often made from gluten-free flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or a blend of rice and tapioca flour. When selecting a gluten-free pita, always check the label to ensure it’s certified gluten-free.</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Meat</h3>
    <p>The meat used in gyros, typically lamb, chicken, or beef, is naturally gluten-free. However, it’s crucial to avoid pre-marinated meats or those with added seasonings, as they may contain gluten. Always opt for fresh, unprocessed meat and season it yourself with gluten-free spices.</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Sauces</h3>
    <p>Sauces like tzatziki, hummus, or tahini are usually gluten-free, but it’s essential to verify the ingredients. Some store-bought sauces may contain additives or thickeners that include gluten. Making your sauces at home is a safe and delicious alternative.</p>
