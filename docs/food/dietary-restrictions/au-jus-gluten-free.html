<h1>Au Jus Gluten Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Au jus, a French term meaning "with juice," is a flavorful sauce made from the natural juices of meat, typically beef. It is a popular accompaniment to dishes like prime rib, French dip sandwiches, and roast beef. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free au jus can be a challenge. This guide will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free au jus, including how to make it, store-bought options, and tips for ensuring it remains gluten-free.</p>

<h2>What is Au Jus?</h2>

<p>Au jus is a thin, flavorful sauce made from the drippings of cooked meat, usually beef. It is often seasoned with herbs, garlic, and onions to enhance its flavor. Traditionally, au jus is served alongside roasted meats to add moisture and depth to the dish. The key to a good au jus lies in the quality of the meat drippings and the balance of seasonings.</p>

<h2>Why Go Gluten-Free with Au Jus?</h2>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of health issues, including digestive problems, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can often be hidden in sauces and gravies. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that your au jus is gluten-free if you need to avoid gluten in your diet.</p>

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Au Jus</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free au jus at home is relatively simple and allows you to control the ingredients to ensure they are safe for a gluten-free diet. Here’s a basic recipe:</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups beef drippings (from roasted meat)</li>
    <li>1 cup beef broth (gluten-free)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch (or another gluten-free thickener)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Collect the drippings from your roasted meat and strain them to remove any solid particles.</li>
    <li>In a saucepan, combine the beef drippings and beef broth. Heat over medium heat until the mixture begins to simmer.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with a little water to create a slurry. Slowly add the slurry to the simmering liquid, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.</li>
    <li>Add the garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Continue to simmer for 5-10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened to your desired consistency.</li>
    <li>Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Serve warm with your favorite gluten-free dishes.</li>
</ol>
