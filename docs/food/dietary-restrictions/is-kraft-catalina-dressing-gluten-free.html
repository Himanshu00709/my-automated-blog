    <h1>Is Kraft Catalina Dressing Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, navigating food labels can be a daunting task. One common question that arises is whether Kraft Catalina Dressing is gluten-free. This article delves into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to provide a comprehensive answer to this question. Whether you're a seasoned gluten-free eater or newly diagnosed, this guide will help you make informed decisions about your diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions. Therefore, it's crucial to identify gluten-free products to maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Kraft Catalina Dressing</h2>

    <p>To determine if Kraft Catalina Dressing is gluten-free, we first need to examine its ingredients. The primary ingredients in Kraft Catalina Dressing include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Tomato Puree</li>
        <li>High Fructose Corn Syrup</li>
        <li>Vinegar</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Onion Powder</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>Natural Flavors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it's essential to consider potential cross-contamination during manufacturing and the presence of hidden gluten in natural flavors or other additives.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can introduce gluten into the product. Kraft Foods has a reputation for transparency regarding allergen information. According to Kraft, their Catalina Dressing is produced in facilities that also process wheat. However, they follow strict cleaning protocols to minimize the risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>It's important to note that while Kraft takes precautions, the risk of cross-contamination cannot be entirely eliminated. For individuals with severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, this might be a concern.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free certification from recognized organizations can provide additional assurance. Unfortunately, Kraft Catalina Dressing does not carry a gluten-free certification from organizations like the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO) or the Celiac Support Association (CSA). This lack of certification means that while the product may be gluten-free based on its ingredients, it hasn't been independently verified.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Information</h2>

    <p>Understanding the nutritional content of Kraft Catalina Dressing can also be beneficial. Below is a table summarizing the nutritional information per serving (2 tablespoons):</p>
