    <h1>Ricotta Cheese: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>Ricotta cheese, a staple in Italian cuisine, has gained popularity worldwide for its creamy texture and versatility. Whether you're a fan of lasagna, cannoli, or simply enjoy it spread on toast, ricotta cheese is a delicious addition to many dishes. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Is ricotta cheese gluten-free? In this article, we'll explore the gluten-free nature of ricotta cheese, its nutritional benefits, and how you can incorporate it into your gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Ricotta Cheese?</h2>
    <p>Ricotta cheese is a fresh, soft cheese made from the whey leftover from the production of other cheeses, such as mozzarella or provolone. The name "ricotta" comes from the Italian word "ricotta," which means "recooked." This refers to the process of reheating the whey to separate the curds, which are then drained and pressed to form the cheese. Ricotta has a mild, slightly sweet flavor and a creamy, grainy texture, making it a versatile ingredient in both savory and sweet dishes.</p>

    <h2>Is Ricotta Cheese Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Yes, ricotta cheese is naturally gluten-free. The primary ingredients in ricotta cheese are whey, milk, and an acid (such as vinegar or lemon juice) to help curdle the milk. None of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it's essential to check the label when purchasing ricotta cheese, as some brands may add thickeners or stabilizers that could contain gluten. Always look for a "gluten-free" certification on the packaging to ensure the product is safe for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>
