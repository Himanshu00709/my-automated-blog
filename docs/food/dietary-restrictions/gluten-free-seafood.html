    <h1>Gluten-Free Seafood: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Seafood is a delicious and nutritious option for those following a gluten-free diet. Whether you're managing celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply choosing to avoid gluten, seafood can be a versatile and safe choice. However, navigating the world of gluten-free seafood requires some knowledge, as not all seafood dishes are inherently gluten-free. In this guide, we'll explore the benefits of gluten-free seafood, how to identify safe options, and provide some delicious recipes to try at home.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Seafood?</h2>
    <p>Seafood is naturally gluten-free, making it an excellent choice for those avoiding gluten. Fish, shellfish, and other seafood are rich in essential nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and vitamins. These nutrients are crucial for maintaining heart health, brain function, and overall well-being. Additionally, seafood is low in saturated fats, making it a heart-healthy option for those looking to maintain a balanced diet.</p>

    <h2>Identifying Gluten-Free Seafood</h2>
    <p>While seafood itself is gluten-free, the way it is prepared and served can introduce gluten. Here are some tips to ensure your seafood remains gluten-free:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fresh vs. Processed:</strong> Always opt for fresh seafood over processed options. Processed seafood, such as breaded fish sticks or imitation crab, often contains gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Labels:</strong> When buying packaged seafood, carefully read the labels to ensure there are no gluten-containing ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> When dining out, don't hesitate to ask about the preparation methods. Cross-contamination can occur in kitchens where gluten-containing foods are also prepared.</li>
    </ul>
