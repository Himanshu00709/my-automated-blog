    <h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Food: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten and dairy-free food has surged, driven by increasing awareness of food intolerances, allergies, and dietary preferences. Whether you're navigating these dietary restrictions due to health reasons or personal choice, understanding the nuances of gluten and dairy-free eating is essential. This guide will explore the benefits, challenges, and practical tips for adopting a gluten and dairy-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>What Does Gluten and Dairy-Free Mean?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It is commonly found in bread, pasta, cereals, and many processed foods. Dairy, on the other hand, refers to products derived from milk, such as cheese, yogurt, butter, and cream. A gluten and dairy-free diet eliminates these ingredients entirely, requiring careful attention to food labels and meal preparation.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of a Gluten and Dairy-Free Diet</h2>
    <p>Adopting a gluten and dairy-free diet can offer numerous health benefits, particularly for individuals with specific medical conditions or sensitivities. Here are some key advantages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Digestive Health:</strong> For those with celiac disease or lactose intolerance, eliminating gluten and dairy can alleviate symptoms like bloating, gas, and diarrhea.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Inflammation:</strong> Gluten and dairy can trigger inflammation in some individuals, leading to joint pain, skin issues, and other inflammatory conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Nutrient Absorption:</strong> Removing gluten and dairy can improve gut health, allowing for better absorption of essential nutrients.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight Management:</strong> A gluten and dairy-free diet often encourages the consumption of whole, unprocessed foods, which can support healthy weight management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges of a Gluten and Dairy-Free Diet</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I still get enough calcium on a dairy-free diet?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can obtain calcium from fortified plant-based milks, leafy greens, almonds, and calcium-set tofu. It’s important to ensure you’re meeting your daily calcium requirements through these sources.</p>
