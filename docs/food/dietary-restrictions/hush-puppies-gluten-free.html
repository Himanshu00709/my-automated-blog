    <h1>Hush Puppies Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Hush puppies are a beloved Southern delicacy, traditionally made from a cornmeal-based batter and deep-fried to golden perfection. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying this classic dish can be a challenge. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free hush puppies, from their history to recipes, nutritional information, and frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>The History of Hush Puppies</h2>
    <p>Hush puppies have a rich history rooted in Southern cuisine. The name "hush puppy" is said to have originated from hunters and fishermen who would fry cornmeal batter and toss it to their dogs to "hush the puppies" during cookouts. Over time, this simple dish evolved into a staple at Southern meals, often served alongside fried fish or barbecue.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, hush puppies are made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets, many have sought to recreate this classic dish using alternative flours and ingredients.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Hush Puppies Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free hush puppies are made by substituting wheat flour with gluten-free alternatives such as almond flour, rice flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. These flours provide the same texture and binding properties as wheat flour, ensuring that the hush puppies remain light and fluffy.</p>
    <p>In addition to the flour, other ingredients like cornmeal, eggs, milk (or a dairy-free alternative), and seasonings are used to create the batter. The key is to ensure that all ingredients are certified gluten-free to avoid cross-contamination.</p>
