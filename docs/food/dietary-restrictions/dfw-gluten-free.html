    <h1>DFW Gluten-Free Guide: A Comprehensive Resource for Celiac and Gluten-Sensitive Individuals</h1>
    <p>Living a gluten-free lifestyle can be challenging, especially in a bustling metropolitan area like Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW).

This guide aims to simplify your journey by providing a detailed overview of gluten-free dining, shopping, and resources in the DFW area.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to a range of symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity, on the other hand, causes similar symptoms without the intestinal damage. Both conditions necessitate a strict gluten-free diet to maintain health and well-being.</p>

    <p>DFW is home to a growing number of restaurants that cater to gluten-free diners. From dedicated gluten-free kitchens to establishments with extensive gluten-free menus, the options are plentiful. Below is a table highlighting some of the top gluten-friendly restaurants in the area:</p>
