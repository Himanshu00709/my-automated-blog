    <h2>Navigating Gluten-Free Dining in China</h2>
    <p>Dining out in China can be a challenge for those on a gluten-free diet, but it is certainly possible with the right approach. Here are some tips to help you navigate the culinary landscape:</p>

    <h3>1. Learn Key Phrases</h3>
    <p>Knowing how to communicate your dietary needs in Mandarin can be incredibly helpful. Phrases like "我不吃含麸质的食物" (Wǒ bù chī hán fūzhí de shíwù) meaning "I don't eat gluten-containing food" can go a long way in ensuring your meal is safe.</p>

    <h3>2. Research Restaurants</h3>
    <p>Before heading out, research restaurants that offer gluten-free options. Many cities in China, especially larger ones like Beijing and Shanghai, have restaurants that cater to gluten-free diets. Websites and apps like HappyCow or local review sites can be valuable resources.</p>

    <h3>3. Be Cautious with Sauces</h3>
    <p>Sauces are a common source of hidden gluten in Chinese cuisine. Soy sauce, for example, is traditionally made with wheat. Opt for tamari, a gluten-free soy sauce alternative, or ask for dishes to be prepared without soy sauce.</p>

    <h3>4. Choose Simple Dishes</h3>
    <p>When in doubt, opt for simple dishes like steamed vegetables, plain rice, or grilled meats. These are less likely to contain hidden gluten and are easier to customize to your dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Shopping in China</h2>
    <p>For those living in or visiting China for an extended period, shopping for gluten-free ingredients can be a lifesaver. Many supermarkets and specialty stores now carry gluten-free products, including rice flour, gluten-free soy sauce, and even gluten-free snacks. Here are some tips for gluten-free shopping in China:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Look for Imported Goods:</strong> Many imported goods, especially from Western countries, are labeled as gluten-free. These can often be found in larger supermarkets or specialty stores.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Labels:</strong> While many products in China may not have English labels, look for the characters "无麸质" (wú fūzhí), which means "gluten-free."</li>
        <li><strong>Visit Health Food Stores:</strong> Health food stores and organic markets are more likely to carry gluten-free products, including flours, pastas, and snacks.</li>
    </ul>
