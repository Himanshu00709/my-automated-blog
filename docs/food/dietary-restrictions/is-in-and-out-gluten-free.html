    <h1>Is In-N-Out Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>In-N-Out Burger is a beloved fast-food chain known for its fresh ingredients and simple menu. For individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can be a challenge. This guide will explore whether In-N-Out is a safe option for those following a gluten-free diet, what menu items are available, and how to navigate the menu to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it's crucial for these individuals to carefully select their food options, especially when dining out.</p>

    <h2>Is In-N-Out Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>In-N-Out does not have a dedicated gluten-free menu, but they do offer some options that can be modified to be gluten-free. The key is to communicate your dietary needs clearly to the staff and understand the potential for cross-contamination.</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Options at In-N-Out</h3>

    <p>Here are some menu items that can be made gluten-free with modifications:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Menu Item</th>
                <th>Modifications</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Hamburger</td>
                <td>Order it "Protein Style" (lettuce wrap instead of a bun)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cheeseburger</td>
                <td>Order it "Protein Style" (lettuce wrap instead of a bun)</td>
            </tr>

                <td>Double-Double</td>
                <td>Order it "Protein Style" (lettuce wrap instead of a bun)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>French Fries</td>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
