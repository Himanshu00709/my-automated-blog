    <h1>Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Mayo: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Mayonnaise is a staple in many kitchens, but for those with dietary restrictions, finding a suitable option can be challenging. Gluten-free and dairy-free mayo has become increasingly popular as more people adopt gluten-free and dairy-free diets due to allergies, intolerances, or personal preferences. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free dairy-free mayo, including its benefits, how to make it at home, and some of the best store-bought options available.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Mayo?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free dairy-free mayo is a type of mayonnaise that is free from gluten and dairy ingredients. Traditional mayonnaise is typically made from eggs, oil, and vinegar or lemon juice. However, some commercial brands may include additives or thickeners that contain gluten or dairy. Gluten-free dairy-free mayo ensures that these ingredients are excluded, making it safe for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or lactose intolerance.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Mayo</h2>

    <p>There are several benefits to choosing gluten-free dairy-free mayo, especially for those with specific dietary needs:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Safe for Celiac Disease:</strong> Individuals with celiac disease must avoid gluten to prevent damage to their small intestine. Gluten-free mayo ensures that there is no risk of cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Lactose-Free:</strong> For those who are lactose intolerant or have a dairy allergy, dairy-free mayo is a safe alternative that won’t cause digestive issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> Gluten-free dairy-free mayo can be used in a variety of recipes, from sandwiches and salads to dips and dressings.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthier Options:</strong> Many gluten-free dairy-free mayo brands use high-quality oils and natural ingredients, making them a healthier choice compared to traditional mayo.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Mayo at Home</h2>

    <p>Making your own gluten-free dairy-free mayo at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of neutral-flavored oil (such as avocado oil or light olive oil)</li>
        <li>1 large egg (or a vegan substitute like aquafaba for an egg-free version)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice or apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard (ensure it’s gluten-free)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender or food processor, combine the egg (or aquafaba), lemon juice, and Dijon mustard.</li>
        <li>Blend on low speed while slowly drizzling in the oil. The mixture will begin to emulsify and thicken.</li>
        <li>Continue blending until the mayo reaches your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Season with salt to taste and blend once more to combine.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mayo to an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to one week.</li>
