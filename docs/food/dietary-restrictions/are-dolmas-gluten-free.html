<h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Dolmas</h2>

</ul>

<h2>How to Ensure Your Dolmas Are Gluten-Free</h2>

    <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> When dining out, don’t hesitate to ask the restaurant staff about the ingredients and preparation methods. Inquire about the risk of cross-contamination in the kitchen.</li>
    <li><strong>Make Your Own:</strong> The safest way to ensure your dolmas are gluten-free is to make them at home. This way, you have complete control over the ingredients and preparation process.</li>
