    <h1>Are Dibs Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, gluten-free diets have gained significant popularity, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals seeking healthier eating habits. One snack that often comes under scrutiny is Dibs, the bite-sized ice cream treats. But are Dibs gluten-free? In this article, we’ll delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential risks associated with Dibs to determine whether they are safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>What Are Dibs?</h2>

    <p>Dibs are a popular snack produced by Nestlé, known for their bite-sized, chocolate-coated ice cream pieces. They come in various flavors, including vanilla, mint, and caramel, and are often marketed as a fun, convenient treat for both kids and adults. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether Dibs are gluten-free is crucial.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it’s essential for these individuals to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and manufacturing processes of the foods they consume.</p>

    <h2>Are Dibs Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Dibs are gluten-free, we need to examine their ingredients and the manufacturing process. According to Nestlé, Dibs are made with the following primary ingredients:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Cocoa Butter</li>
        <li>Chocolate</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>Natural and Artificial Flavors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, the presence of natural and artificial flavors can sometimes be a red flag, as these may contain hidden sources of gluten. Additionally, cross-contamination during manufacturing is a concern for those with severe gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h3>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination</h3>

    <p>Nestlé states that they follow strict manufacturing processes to prevent cross-contamination. However, they also note that their facilities may process products containing gluten, which could pose a risk for individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity. Therefore, while Dibs do not contain gluten ingredients, they may not be entirely safe for those with the most severe gluten-related conditions.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Information</h2>

    <p>For those who are not strictly gluten-free but are curious about the nutritional content of Dibs, here’s a breakdown of the nutritional information per serving:</p>
