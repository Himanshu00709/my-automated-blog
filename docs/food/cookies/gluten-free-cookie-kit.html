    <h3>1. Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Check the ingredient list to ensure that the kit contains high-quality, gluten-free ingredients. Look for kits that use natural sweeteners and avoid artificial additives.</p>

    <h3>2. Flavor Options</h3>
    <p>Consider the flavor options available in the kit. Whether you prefer classic chocolate chip cookies or more adventurous flavors like lemon poppy seed, there’s a kit out there for you.</p>

    <h3>3. Dietary Restrictions</h3>
    <p>If you have additional dietary restrictions, such as dairy-free or nut-free, make sure the kit meets those requirements. Many kits are designed to accommodate multiple dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>How to Use a Gluten-Free Cookie Kit</h2>
    <p>Using a gluten-free cookie kit is straightforward, but there are a few tips to ensure the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Read the Instructions:</strong> Before you start, carefully read the instructions provided in the kit. This will help you understand the steps and avoid any mistakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong> Make sure your oven is preheated to the correct temperature before you begin baking. This ensures even cooking and prevents undercooked or overcooked cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure Ingredients:</strong> Even though the ingredients are pre-measured, double-check the measurements to ensure accuracy. This is especially important for baking powder and other leavening agents.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Thoroughly:</strong> Mix the ingredients thoroughly to ensure a consistent dough. Overmixing can lead to tough cookies, so be careful not to overdo it.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake and Cool:</strong> Follow the recommended baking time and allow the cookies to cool completely before decorating or serving. This helps the cookies set and develop their full flavor.</li>
    </ol>
