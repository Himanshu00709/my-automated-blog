    <p>Making gluten-free dairy-free marshmallows at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons unflavored gelatin</li>
        <li>1 cup cold water (divided)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup light corn syrup</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tapioca starch (for dusting)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, sprinkle the gelatin over 1/2 cup of cold water. Let it bloom for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup, salt, and remaining 1/2 cup of water. Heat over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil and cook until the mixture reaches 240°F (115°C) on a candy thermometer.</li>
        <li>With the mixer on low speed, slowly pour the hot sugar syrup into the gelatin mixture. Gradually increase the speed to high and beat for 10-12 minutes, or until the mixture is thick, fluffy, and tripled in volume.</li>
        <li>Add the vanilla extract and beat for another minute to incorporate.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish and dust it with tapioca starch. Pour the marshmallow mixture into the dish and smooth the top with a spatula. Dust the top with more tapioca starch.</li>
        <li>Let the marshmallows set at room temperature for at least 4 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Once set, cut the marshmallows into squares using a sharp knife or pizza cutter. Dust the cut edges with more tapioca starch to prevent sticking.</li>
    </ol>
