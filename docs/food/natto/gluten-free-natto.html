    <h2>How is Gluten-Free Natto Made?</h2>

    <p>The process of making natto is relatively simple but requires precision to achieve the desired texture and flavor. Here’s a step-by-step guide to making gluten-free natto:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Selecting the Soybeans:</strong> High-quality, non-GMO soybeans are essential for making natto. The soybeans should be thoroughly cleaned and soaked in water for several hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Steaming the Soybeans:</strong> After soaking, the soybeans are steamed until they become soft. This step is crucial for ensuring the beans are ready for fermentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Inoculation with Bacillus subtilis:</strong> Once the soybeans are steamed, they are mixed with the <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> bacteria. This bacterium is responsible for the fermentation process.</li>
        <li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> The inoculated soybeans are placed in a warm, humid environment for 24-48 hours. During this time, the bacteria produce enzymes that break down the soybeans, resulting in the characteristic sticky texture and strong aroma of natto.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> After fermentation, the natto is cooled and stored in the refrigerator. It can be consumed immediately or kept for several days to develop a stronger flavor.</li>
    </ol>
