    <p>Making gluten-free vegan bagels at home is easier than you might think. With a few simple ingredients and some patience, you can create delicious, chewy bagels that rival their traditional counterparts. Here’s a basic recipe to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend (e.g., almond flour, rice flour, or a pre-made blend)</li>
        <li>1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar or maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
        <li>Optional toppings: sesame seeds, poppy seeds, garlic powder, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until the yeast becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, salt, and baking powder. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes, then shape it into a ball. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rise for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Divide the dough into 6 equal portions and shape each into a bagel by forming a ball and poking a hole in the center.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Boil each bagel for 1-2 minutes on each side, then place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Brush the bagels with a little olive oil and sprinkle with your desired toppings. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let the bagels cool before serving. Enjoy with your favorite vegan spreads!</li>
    </ol>
