    <h1>Gluten-Free Chocolate Peppermint Cake: A Holiday Delight</h1>
    <p>As the holiday season approaches, the aroma of freshly baked goods fills the air, and nothing says "festive" quite like a rich, decadent chocolate peppermint cake. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding the perfect dessert can be a challenge. But fear not! This gluten-free chocolate peppermint cake is not only delicious but also easy to make, ensuring that everyone can enjoy a slice of holiday cheer.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular, not just for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also for individuals looking to reduce their gluten intake for health reasons. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and inflammation in some people. By using gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose blend, you can create baked goods that are just as tasty and satisfying as their traditional counterparts.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free chocolate peppermint cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla and peppermint extracts.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Hot Water:</strong> Stir in the hot water until the batter is smooth. The batter will be thin, but this is normal.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li><strong>Frost and Decorate:</strong> Once the cakes are completely cool, frost with your favorite gluten-free frosting and sprinkle with crushed peppermint candies.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend you prefer. Almond flour or coconut flour can also be used, but you may need to adjust the quantities as they absorb moisture differently.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil, and use a non-dairy milk in place of buttermilk.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>
