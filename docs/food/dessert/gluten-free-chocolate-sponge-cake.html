    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all the ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free chocolate sponge cake:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper to prevent the cake from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Beat Eggs and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving the sponge-like texture of the cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add the vanilla extract, milk, and vegetable oil to the egg and sugar mixture. Mix until everything is well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can dust it with powdered sugar, frost it, or serve it as is.</p>
