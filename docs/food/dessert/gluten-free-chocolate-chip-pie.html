    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started on making the pie. Follow these steps for a perfect gluten-free chocolate chip pie:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your pie bakes evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Pie Crust:</strong> If you're using a pre-made gluten-free pie crust, simply place it in your pie dish. If you're making your own, roll out the dough and press it into the dish, crimping the edges as desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Chocolate Chips:</strong> Fold in the gluten-free chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Pie:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared pie crust, spreading it evenly with a spatula.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the pie to cool completely before slicing and serving. This helps the pie set and makes it easier to cut.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Pie</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free chocolate chip pie turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking and can be used as a 1:1 substitute for all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense, tough pie. Mix the ingredients until just combined to ensure a light, tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Ovens can vary, so keep an eye on your pie as it bakes. The top should be golden brown, and a toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Let It Cool:</strong> It can be tempting to dig in right away, but allowing the pie to cool completely will help it set and make it easier to slice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have a gluten intolerance or celiac disease, you can use regular all-purpose flour. However, the recipe is specifically designed for gluten-free flour, so the texture may vary slightly if you use regular flour.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this pie dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this pie dairy-free by substituting the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or a plant-based butter. Ensure that the chocolate chips you use are also dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the pie?</h3>
        <p>Store the pie in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the pie for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts to the pie?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you enjoy nuts, feel free to add a cup of chopped walnuts or pecans to the batter for added texture and flavor.</p>
    </div>
