<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, melted unsalted butter, and granulated sugar. Mix until the ingredients are well combined and the mixture resembles wet sand. Press the mixture into a 9-inch pie dish, ensuring an even layer across the bottom and up the sides. Bake the crust for 10-12 minutes, or until it is lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Make the Chocolate Filling</h3>
<p>In a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water, melt the dark chocolate, stirring occasionally until smooth. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Gradually add the melted chocolate to the egg mixture, stirring constantly to avoid curdling. Add the vanilla extract and salt, and mix until fully incorporated.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Whip the Cream</h3>
<p>In a chilled bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture, being careful not to deflate the cream. This will give the filling its signature light and airy texture.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Assemble the Pie</h3>
<p>Pour the chocolate filling into the cooled crust, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Refrigerate the pie for at least 4 hours, or until the filling is set. For best results, let it chill overnight.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once the pie is fully set, slice and serve with your choice of toppings. A dollop of whipped cream, a sprinkle of cocoa powder, or a handful of fresh berries can elevate the dessert to new heights.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chocolate Silk Pie</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different type of flour for the crust?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours such as oat flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Keep in mind that the texture and flavor of the crust may vary slightly depending on the flour used.</p>

    <h3>2. Is this pie suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>This particular recipe contains eggs and dairy, so it is not vegan. However, you can make a vegan version by using dairy-free chocolate, coconut cream, and a vegan egg substitute such as flaxseed meal or aquafaba.</p>

    <h3>3. How long does the pie last in the refrigerator?</h3>
    <p>The pie can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. Make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container to prevent it from absorbing any odors.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I freeze the pie?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the pie for up to 2 months. To freeze, wrap the pie tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>
