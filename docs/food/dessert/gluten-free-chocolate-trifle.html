    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Bake the Gluten-Free Chocolate Cake</h3>
    <p>Start by preparing the gluten-free chocolate cake. You can use a store-bought gluten-free cake mix or make your own from scratch. Bake the cake according to the instructions and let it cool completely. Once cooled, cut the cake into bite-sized cubes. These will form the base layer of your trifle.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Chocolate Pudding</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free chocolate pudding mix and milk. Follow the package instructions to achieve the right consistency. Let the pudding set in the refrigerator for about 10-15 minutes. This will ensure it’s thick and creamy when you assemble the trifle.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Layer the Trifle</h3>
    <p>Now comes the fun part—layering! In a large trifle dish or glass bowl, start by placing a layer of the chocolate cake cubes at the bottom. Next, add a layer of the prepared chocolate pudding, followed by a layer of whipped cream. Repeat these layers until the dish is full, finishing with a final layer of whipped cream on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>To add a touch of elegance, garnish the top of your trifle with chocolate shavings and fresh berries. Refrigerate the trifle for at least an hour before serving to allow the flavors to meld together. When ready, scoop out generous portions and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Chocolate Trifle</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Ingredients:</strong> Since the dessert is gluten-free, ensure all ingredients are certified gluten-free to avoid any cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize the Layers:</strong> Feel free to add other layers like caramel sauce, crushed nuts, or even a layer of fresh fruit for added texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> This dessert can be made a day in advance, making it perfect for parties or gatherings.</li>
