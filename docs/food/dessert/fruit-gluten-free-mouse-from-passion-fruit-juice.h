    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Gelatin</h3>
    <p>Start by blooming the gelatin. In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over 1/4 cup of cold water and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Once the gelatin has absorbed the water and become spongy, heat it gently in the microwave or over a double boiler until it dissolves completely. Be careful not to boil it, as this can affect its setting properties.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the passion fruit juice and condensed milk. Stir until well mixed. Gradually add the dissolved gelatin to the mixture, stirring continuously to ensure it is evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Whip the Cream</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until it reaches stiff peaks. Be careful not to over-whip, as this can cause the cream to separate. Gently fold the whipped cream into the passion fruit mixture until fully incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Chill the Mousse</h3>
    <p>Pour the mousse mixture into individual serving glasses or a large serving dish. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until set. For an extra touch of elegance, garnish with fresh passion fruit pulp before serving.</p>
