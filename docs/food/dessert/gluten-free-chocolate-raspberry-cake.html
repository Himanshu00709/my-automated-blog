    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Batter</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and greasing two 9-inch round cake pans. In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate large bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>2. Combining Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake. Gently fold in the fresh raspberries, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

    <h3>3. Baking the Cake</h3>

    <p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>4. Making the Chocolate Ganache</h3>

    <p>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the chocolate ganache. Place the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream until it just begins to simmer. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let it sit for 2-3 minutes. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth. Allow the ganache to cool slightly before using.</p>

    <h3>5. Assembling the Cake</h3>

    <p>Once the cakes are completely cool, place one layer on a serving plate. Spread a generous layer of chocolate ganache over the top. Place the second cake layer on top and cover the entire cake with the remaining ganache. For an extra touch, garnish with additional fresh raspberries and a dusting of powdered sugar.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen raspberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen raspberries, but make sure to thaw and drain them thoroughly before adding them to the batter. Excess moisture can affect the texture of the cake.</p>

        <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best for this cake?</h3>
        <p>A high-quality gluten-free flour blend that includes xanthan gum works best. Brands like Bob’s Red Mill or King Arthur Flour are excellent choices.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil, and use a non-dairy milk mixed with a teaspoon of vinegar in place of buttermilk. For the ganache, use dairy-free chocolate and coconut cream.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Bring it to room temperature before serving for the best flavor and texture.</p>
