    <h1>Gluten-Free Baked Alaska: A Delightful Dessert for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Baked Alaska is a classic dessert that combines the richness of cake, the creaminess of ice cream, and the elegance of toasted meringue. Traditionally, this dessert is made with a sponge cake base, which contains gluten. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets, many people are looking for ways to enjoy their favorite desserts without compromising their health. Enter the gluten-free Baked Alaska—a dessert that is just as delicious and impressive as the original, but suitable for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>What is Baked Alaska?</h2>

    <p>Baked Alaska is a dessert that originated in the 19th century and is known for its dramatic presentation.

The result is a dessert that is both hot and cold, with a contrast of textures and flavors that is truly unique.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Cake</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, cream together the butter and 1/2 cup of sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. Gradually add the gluten-free flour blend and milk, alternating between the two, and mix until just combined. Pour the batter into a greased cake pan and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>2. Assemble the Baked Alaska</h3>

    <p>Once the cake has cooled, place it on a serving plate. Scoop the ice cream onto the cake, shaping it into a dome. Place the cake and ice cream in the freezer while you prepare the meringue.</p>

    <h3>3. Make the Meringue</h3>

    <p>In a clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. Remove the cake and ice cream from the freezer and quickly spread the meringue over the entire surface, making sure to seal the edges completely.</p>

    <h3>4. Toast the Meringue</h3>

    <p>Using a kitchen torch, carefully brown the meringue all over. If you don't have a torch, you can place the dessert in a preheated 500°F (260°C) oven for 2-3 minutes, or until the meringue is golden brown. Serve immediately.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use store-bought gluten-free cake for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a store-bought gluten-free cake if you're short on time. Just make sure it's a plain flavor that complements the ice cream and meringue.</p>

        <h3>What type of ice cream works best for Baked Alaska?</h3>
        <p>You can use any flavor of ice cream you like. Classic choices include vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry, but feel free to get creative with your favorite flavors.</p>

        <h3>Can I make Baked Alaska ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can assemble the cake and ice cream ahead of time and keep it in the freezer. However, it's best to add the meringue and toast it just before serving to ensure the best texture and presentation.</p>

        <h3>Is Baked Alaska safe for people with egg allergies?</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, traditional Baked Alaska contains eggs in both the cake and the meringue. If you have an egg allergy, you may need to look for egg-free alternatives for both components.</p>
