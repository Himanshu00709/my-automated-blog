    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free coconut custard pie:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> Place the gluten-free pie crust in a 9-inch pie dish and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Custard:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Coconut:</strong> Stir in the shredded coconut until evenly distributed throughout the custard mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour into Crust:</strong> Pour the custard mixture into the prepared pie crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the custard is set and the top is golden brown.</li>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Coconut Custard Pie</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your pie turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Full-Fat Coconut Milk:</strong> Full-fat coconut milk will give your custard a richer, creamier texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the custard can lead to a dense pie. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
