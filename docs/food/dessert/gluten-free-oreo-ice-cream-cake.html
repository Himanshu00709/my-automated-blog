    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by crushing the gluten-free Oreo cookies into fine crumbs. You can use a food processor or place the cookies in a zip-top bag and crush them with a rolling pin. Mix the crumbs with melted butter until well combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan to form the crust. Place the pan in the freezer to set while you prepare the ice cream layer.</p>

    <h3>2. Layer the Ice Cream</h3>
    <p>Allow the vanilla ice cream to soften slightly at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Once softened, spread the ice cream evenly over the Oreo crust. Smooth the top with a spatula and return the pan to the freezer to firm up for at least 2 hours.</p>

    <h3>3. Add the Toppings</h3>
    <p>Once the ice cream layer is firm, spread a layer of whipped cream over the top. Drizzle chocolate syrup over the whipped cream and sprinkle gluten-free chocolate chips for added texture and flavor. Return the cake to the freezer for another hour to set the toppings.</p>

    <h3>4. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>When ready to serve, remove the cake from the freezer and let it sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes to make slicing easier. Use a sharp knife to cut the cake into slices and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>While this gluten-free Oreo ice cream cake is undoubtedly a treat, it does offer some nutritional benefits. Gluten-free Oreos are made with alternative flours like rice flour, which can be easier to digest for those with gluten sensitivities. Additionally, using high-quality ice cream and whipped cream ensures that you’re getting a good source of calcium and protein. However, moderation is key, as this dessert is still high in sugar and calories.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different type of ice cream?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While vanilla ice cream is a classic choice, you can experiment with other flavors like chocolate, mint, or even cookies and cream. Just make sure the ice cream is gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>2. How long can I store the cake in the freezer?</h3>
        <p>The cake can be stored in the freezer for up to 2 weeks. Make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this cake dairy-free by using dairy-free ice cream, whipped cream, and butter substitutes. Many brands offer excellent dairy-free alternatives that work well in this recipe.</p>

        <h3>4. Are gluten-free Oreos really gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free Oreos are made without wheat, barley, or rye, making them safe for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. However, always check the packaging to ensure they meet your dietary needs.</p>
