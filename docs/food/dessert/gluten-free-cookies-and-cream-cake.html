    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>

    <p>Creating a gluten-free cookies and cream cake is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to bake a cake that’s moist, flavorful, and utterly delicious:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>5. Alternate Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined; do not overmix.</p>

    <h3>6. Fold in Crushed Cookies</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the crushed gluten-free chocolate sandwich cookies. This will add a delightful texture and flavor to the cake.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>8. Prepare the Frosting</h3>
    <p>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the frosting. Whip the heavy cream and powdered sugar together until stiff peaks form. Fold in some additional crushed cookies for extra flavor.</p>

    <h3>9. Assemble the Cake</h3>
    <p>Once the cakes are completely cool, spread a layer of frosting on top of one cake layer. Place the second layer on top and frost the entire cake. Garnish with more crushed cookies for a stunning finish.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cookies and Cream Cake</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>No, using regular flour will make the cake unsuitable for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Always use a certified gluten-free flour blend for this recipe.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil, and use a dairy-free milk in place of buttermilk. For the frosting, use a dairy-free whipped topping.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Allow it to come to room temperature before serving for the best texture.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I freeze the cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cake layers (unfrosted) for up to 2 months. Wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil. Thaw in the refrigerator before frosting and serving.</p>
