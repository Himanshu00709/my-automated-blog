    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to bake your gluten-free eggnog cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch round cake pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the eggnog. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
