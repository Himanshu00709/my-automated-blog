    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Mississippi Mud Pie</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free Mississippi Mud Pie is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a dessert that will impress your family and friends:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by crushing gluten-free chocolate cookies or graham crackers into fine crumbs. Mix the crumbs with melted butter and press the mixture into a pie dish. Bake the crust for about 10 minutes at 350°F (175°C) to set it.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a saucepan, combine gluten-free chocolate chips, butter, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Melt the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly. Once smooth, remove from heat and let it cool slightly. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs and vanilla extract, then slowly incorporate the chocolate mixture. Pour the filling into the prepared crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake and Chill</h3>
    <p>Bake the pie at 325°F (160°C) for 25-30 minutes, or until the filling is set but still slightly wobbly in the center. Allow the pie to cool completely before refrigerating it for at least 4 hours, or overnight, to firm up.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Topping</h3>
    <p>Before serving, top the pie with freshly whipped cream and a sprinkle of chocolate shavings or cocoa powder for an extra touch of elegance.</p>
