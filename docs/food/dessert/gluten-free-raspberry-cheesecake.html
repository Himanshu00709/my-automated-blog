<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Crust</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (163°C). In a medium-sized bowl, combine the crushed gluten-free graham crackers or cookies with the melted butter. Mix until the crumbs are evenly coated. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, ensuring an even layer. Bake the crust for about 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

<h3>2. Making the Cheesecake Filling</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until it’s smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar, continuing to beat until well combined. Next, mix in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Add the eggs one at a time, beating just until each egg is incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cheesecake.</p>

<h3>3. Adding the Raspberry Swirl</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, gently mash the fresh raspberries with a fork until they’re slightly broken down but still chunky. Fold the mashed raspberries into the cheesecake batter, creating a marbled effect. Pour the batter over the cooled crust, spreading it evenly. Drop small spoonfuls of raspberry jam onto the surface of the batter, then use a knife or toothpick to swirl the jam into the batter for a beautiful marbled effect.</p>

<h3>4. Baking the Cheesecake</h3>

<p>Place the springform pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 50-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door slightly ajar for about an hour. This gradual cooling process helps prevent cracks from forming on the surface of the cheesecake.</p>

<h3>5. Chilling and Serving</h3>

<p>Once the cheesecake has cooled to room temperature, transfer it to the refrigerator and let it chill for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. This allows the flavors to meld and the texture to set perfectly. When ready to serve, carefully remove the cheesecake from the springform pan, slice, and enjoy!</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Raspberry Cheesecake</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use frozen raspberries instead of fresh ones?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen raspberries if fresh ones are not available. However, make sure to thaw and drain them well before using to avoid excess moisture in the cheesecake.</p>

    <h3>2. How do I store leftover cheesecake?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover cheesecake in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze it for up to 2 months. To freeze, wrap the cheesecake tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make this cheesecake dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make a dairy-free version by using dairy-free cream cheese, sour cream, and butter substitutes. Just ensure that all the ingredients are gluten-free as well.</p>

    <h3>4. Why did my cheesecake crack?</h3>
    <p>Cheesecakes can crack due to overmixing the batter, overbaking, or rapid temperature changes. To prevent cracks, avoid overmixing, bake until just set, and allow the cheesecake to cool gradually in the oven.</p>
