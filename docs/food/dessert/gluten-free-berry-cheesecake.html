<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (160°C). Crush the gluten-free graham crackers into fine crumbs using a food processor or by placing them in a sealed bag and crushing them with a rolling pin. Mix the crumbs with melted butter until well combined. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, creating an even layer. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Cheesecake Filling</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar, sour cream, and vanilla extract, mixing until fully incorporated. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Pour the filling over the cooled crust and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake the cheesecake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle.</p>

<h3>3. Prepare the Berry Topping</h3>
<p>While the cheesecake is baking, prepare the berry topping. In a saucepan, combine the fresh berries, lemon juice, and cornstarch. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the berries release their juices and the mixture thickens slightly. Remove from heat and let it cool. Once the cheesecake has cooled, spread the berry topping evenly over the surface.</p>

<h3>4. Chill and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the cheesecake to cool completely at room temperature, then refrigerate it for at least 4 hours or overnight to set. When ready to serve, remove the cheesecake from the springform pan, slice, and enjoy!</p>
