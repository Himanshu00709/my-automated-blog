    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free chocolate and raspberry cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the buttermilk. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Raspberries:</strong> Gently fold in the fresh raspberries, being careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Ganache:</strong> While the cakes are cooling, prepare the chocolate ganache by heating the heavy cream until just boiling. Pour the hot cream over the chopped dark chocolate and let it sit for a few minutes before stirring until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Cake:</strong> Once the cakes are completely cool, spread a layer of ganache on top of one cake layer, then place the second layer on top. Cover the entire cake with the remaining ganache.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Garnish with additional raspberries and serve.</li>
    </ol>
