    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a medium-sized bowl, combine the gluten-free chocolate cookie crumbs and melted butter. Mix until the crumbs are evenly coated. Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie dish. Bake the crust for about 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool completely.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Peanut Butter Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and powdered sugar together until smooth. Add the creamy peanut butter and vanilla extract, and continue to mix until well combined. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture until fully incorporated. Spread this filling evenly over the cooled crust.</p>

    <h3>3. Create the Chocolate Topping</h3>
    <p>In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the dark chocolate chips in 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval until smooth. Pour the melted chocolate over the peanut butter filling, spreading it evenly with a spatula. If desired, sprinkle a pinch of sea salt over the top for a sweet and salty contrast.</p>

    <h3>4. Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Place the pie in the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours, or until the filling is set. Once chilled, slice and serve your gluten-free peanut butter chocolate pie. For an extra touch, you can garnish each slice with a dollop of whipped cream or a drizzle of peanut butter.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Pie</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Ingredients:</strong> Since this pie relies on the flavors of peanut butter and chocolate, it's important to use high-quality ingredients for the best taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill Thoroughly:</strong> Allowing the pie to chill for the recommended time ensures that the filling sets properly and makes for easier slicing.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> Feel free to get creative with toppings. Crushed peanuts, chocolate shavings, or even a caramel drizzle can add an extra layer of flavor and texture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use natural peanut butter for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use natural peanut butter, but keep in mind that it may separate and affect the texture of the filling. For best results, use a creamy, no-stir peanut butter.</p>

        <h3>How long can I store this pie?</h3>
        <p>This pie can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container to maintain freshness.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this pie ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This pie is a great make-ahead dessert. You can prepare it a day in advance and keep it refrigerated until you're ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>Is this pie suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe contains dairy, so it is not vegan. However, you can make it vegan by using dairy-free cream cheese, vegan butter, and coconut cream instead of heavy cream.</p>
