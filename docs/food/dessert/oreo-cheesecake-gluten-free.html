    <h1>Gluten-Free Oreo Cheesecake: A Delicious Indulgence</h1>
    <p>Cheesecake is a timeless dessert that has been enjoyed for generations. Its creamy texture and rich flavor make it a favorite among dessert lovers.

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Oreo Cheesecake?</h2>
    <p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a dessert that is both delicious and safe to eat can be a challenge. Traditional Oreo cookies contain gluten, but thanks to the growing demand for gluten-free products, there are now gluten-free Oreo alternatives available. These cookies allow you to enjoy the same great taste without the gluten. When combined with a creamy cheesecake filling, the result is a dessert that is both indulgent and inclusive.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (163°C). Crush 24 gluten-free Oreo cookies into fine crumbs using a food processor or by placing them in a zip-top bag and crushing them with a rolling pin. Mix the crumbs with the melted butter until well combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, ensuring an even layer. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Cheesecake Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar, mixing until fully incorporated. Add the sour cream and vanilla extract, and mix until combined. Finally, add the eggs one at a time, mixing just until each egg is incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cheesecake.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the cheesecake filling over the cooled crust. Crush 6 additional gluten-free Oreo cookies and sprinkle them over the top of the filling. Place the springform pan in a larger baking dish and fill the dish with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the springform pan. This water bath will help prevent cracks in your cheesecake. Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle.</p>

    <h3>4. Cool and Chill</h3>
    <p>Once baked, turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the door slightly ajar for about an hour. This gradual cooling process helps prevent cracks. After an hour, remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature. Once cooled, refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow it to set completely.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>When ready to serve, remove the cheesecake from the springform pan and slice it into portions. For an extra touch, you can garnish each slice with additional crushed gluten-free Oreo cookies or a dollop of whipped cream. This cheesecake pairs wonderfully with a cup of coffee or a glass of milk, making it the perfect dessert for any occasion.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular Oreo cookies if I don't have gluten-free ones?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have gluten sensitivities, you can certainly use regular Oreo cookies. However, for those who need to avoid gluten, it's important to stick with gluten-free Oreo alternatives to ensure the dessert is safe to eat.</p>

        <h3>How long does gluten-free Oreo cheesecake last in the fridge?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free Oreo cheesecake can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container to maintain its freshness.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free Oreo cheesecake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze gluten-free Oreo cheesecake. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil before placing it in the freezer. It can be frozen for up to 2 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of sour cream?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have sour cream, you can substitute it with an equal amount of Greek yogurt. This will give the cheesecake a similar tangy flavor and creamy texture.</p>
