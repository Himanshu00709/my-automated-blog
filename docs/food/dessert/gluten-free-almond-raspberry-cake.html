    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's walk through the steps to bake this delicious cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Raspberries:</strong> Gently fold in the fresh raspberries, being careful not to crush them too much. The raspberries will add bursts of flavor throughout the cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with powdered sugar before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Almond Raspberry Cake</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your cake turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Raspberries:</strong> Fresh raspberries are ideal for this recipe, but if they're out of season, you can use frozen raspberries. Just make sure to thaw and drain them well before folding them into the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined to maintain a light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking your cake at the 30-minute mark. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it Cool:</strong> Allow the cake to cool completely before slicing. This helps the flavors to meld and makes for cleaner slices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use other berries instead of raspberries?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While raspberries are the star of this recipe, you can easily substitute them with other berries like blueberries, blackberries, or even a mix of your favorites. Just keep in mind that different berries may have varying levels of moisture, so adjust the baking time if necessary.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this cake dairy-free by substituting the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or a plant-based butter. Just ensure that the substitute is suitable for baking.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. If you need to store it longer, you can refrigerate it for up to 5 days. Bring it to room temperature before serving for the best flavor and texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this cake freezes well. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil before placing it in the freezer. It can be stored for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>
