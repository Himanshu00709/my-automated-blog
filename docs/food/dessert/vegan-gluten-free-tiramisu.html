    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Coffee Mixture</h3>
    <p>Start by brewing a strong cup of coffee or espresso. Allow it to cool to room temperature. If you prefer a sweeter tiramisu, you can add a tablespoon of maple syrup or agave nectar to the coffee. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Vegan Cream Filling</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine vegan cream cheese or cashew cream with a sweetener of your choice (such as powdered sugar or maple syrup). Add a splash of vanilla extract for flavor. If you’re using aquafaba, whip it until it forms stiff peaks and gently fold it into the cream mixture to create a light and airy texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Tiramisu</h3>
    <p>Dip each gluten-free ladyfinger or sponge cake slice into the cooled coffee mixture, making sure not to soak them too much. Arrange a layer of soaked ladyfingers at the bottom of your serving dish. Spread a layer of the vegan cream filling over the ladyfingers. Repeat the process, creating multiple layers until you reach the top of the dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Cover the tiramisu with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. This allows the flavors to meld and the dessert to set. Before serving, dust the top with unsweetened cocoa powder using a fine mesh sieve. Slice and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this tiramisu ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, vegan gluten-free tiramisu actually tastes better when made ahead of time. The flavors have more time to develop, and the dessert sets properly. It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free ladyfingers?</h3>
        <p>If you can’t find gluten-free ladyfingers, you can use gluten-free sponge cake or even gluten-free biscotti. Just make sure to cut them into slices that are similar in size to ladyfingers.</p>

        <h3>Is there a nut-free alternative to cashew cream?</h3>
        <p>Yes, if you have a nut allergy, you can use coconut cream or a store-bought vegan cream cheese as a substitute for cashew cream. Just ensure that the cream cheese is nut-free.</p>

        <h3>Can I use decaf coffee?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer to avoid caffeine, you can use decaf coffee or espresso in this recipe. The flavor will still be rich and satisfying.</p>
