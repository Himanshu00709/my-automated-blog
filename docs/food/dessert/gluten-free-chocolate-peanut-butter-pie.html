    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Crush the gluten-free chocolate cookies into fine crumbs using a food processor or by placing them in a zip-top bag and rolling them with a rolling pin. Mix the crumbs with melted butter until well combined. Press the mixture firmly into a 9-inch pie dish, ensuring an even layer on the bottom and sides. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then let it cool completely.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth. Add the peanut butter and powdered sugar, and continue to mix until fully incorporated. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture, being careful not to deflate the cream. Add the vanilla extract and mix until just combined.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Pour the peanut butter filling into the cooled crust, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Smooth the top to create an even surface. Place the pie in the refrigerator to set for at least 4 hours, or overnight for best results.</p>

    <h3>4. Add the Chocolate Topping</h3>
    <p>Once the pie has set, melt the dark chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl or over a double boiler. Drizzle the melted chocolate over the top of the pie, creating a decorative pattern. Return the pie to the refrigerator for an additional 30 minutes to allow the chocolate to set.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Pie</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use high-quality ingredients:</strong> Since this pie has minimal ingredients, using high-quality peanut butter and chocolate will make a significant difference in flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill thoroughly:</strong> Allowing the pie to set in the refrigerator ensures a firm and sliceable texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize the toppings:</strong> Feel free to add chopped peanuts, a sprinkle of sea salt, or even a dollop of whipped cream on top for extra flair.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of nut butter?</h3>
