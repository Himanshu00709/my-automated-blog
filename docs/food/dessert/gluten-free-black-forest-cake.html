    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing the Gluten-Free Chocolate Sponge Cake</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line two 9-inch round cake pans with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, and sugar. Add the softened butter and eggs, and mix until the batter is smooth and well-combined. Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared pans and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool completely before removing them from the pans.</p>

    <h3>2. Preparing the Cherry Filling</h3>
    <p>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the cherry filling. In a saucepan, combine the cherries with a small amount of sugar (adjust to taste) and cook over medium heat until the cherries release their juices and the mixture thickens slightly. If using kirsch, stir it in at the end. Allow the filling to cool completely before assembling the cake.</p>

    <h3>3. Assembling the Cake</h3>
    <p>Once the cakes and cherry filling are completely cooled, it’s time to assemble the cake. Place one layer of the chocolate sponge cake on a serving plate. Spread a layer of whipped cream over the top, followed by a generous layer of the cherry filling. Place the second cake layer on top and repeat the process. Finish by covering the entire cake with whipped cream and decorating with additional cherries and chocolate shavings if desired.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free Black Forest Cake can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be sure to succeed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a reliable gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking cakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool the cakes completely:</strong> Assembling the cake with warm layers can cause the whipped cream to melt and the cake to become soggy.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill before serving:</strong> For the best texture, chill the assembled cake in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a dairy-free version by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using coconut whipped cream instead of traditional whipped cream.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen cherries?</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How long does this cake last?</h3>
