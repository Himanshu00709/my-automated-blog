    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free chocolate sheet cake is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a moist and delicious cake that everyone will love:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the buttermilk. Mix until just combined. Finally, stir in the hot water until the batter is smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool completely in the pan before serving. You can top it with your favorite frosting or enjoy it as is.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Baking</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be well on your way to creating a perfect gluten-free chocolate sheet cake:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined to ensure a light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Xanthan Gum if Needed:</strong> Some gluten-free flour blends already include xanthan gum, but if yours doesn't, consider adding 1/2 teaspoon to help bind the ingredients together.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Cake Cool Completely:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be more delicate when warm. Letting the cake cool completely will make it easier to slice and serve.</li>
    </ul>
