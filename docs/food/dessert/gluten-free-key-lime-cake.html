    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create a gluten-free key lime cake that’s moist, tangy, and utterly delicious.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper to prevent the cake from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream the unsalted butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Flavorings</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the key lime juice, key lime zest, Greek yogurt, and vanilla extract. The mixture should be smooth and well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can dust it with powdered sugar or top it with a gluten-free key lime glaze for extra flavor.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Key Lime Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular limes instead of key limes?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular limes if key limes are not available. However, key limes have a more intense and tangy flavor, which is why they are preferred for this recipe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best?</h3>
        <p>A blend of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch works well for gluten-free baking. You can also use a pre-made gluten-free flour blend available in most grocery stores.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil, and use a dairy-free yogurt in place of Greek yogurt.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>
    </div>
