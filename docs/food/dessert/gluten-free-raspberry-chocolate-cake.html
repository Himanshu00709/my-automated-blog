<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper to ensure the cake doesn’t stick.</p>

<h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>

<h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

<h3>4. Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
<p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the vanilla extract.</p>

<h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined; do not overmix.</p>

<h3>6. Fold in Raspberries and Chocolate Chips</h3>
<p>Gently fold in the fresh raspberries and dark chocolate chips. Be careful not to crush the raspberries too much.</p>

<h3>7. Bake the Cake</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>8. Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

<p>This gluten-free raspberry chocolate cake is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Raspberries are rich in vitamins C and K, as well as dietary fiber, which aids in digestion. Dark chocolate is known for its high antioxidant content, which can help reduce inflammation and improve heart health. By using gluten-free flours, you’re also avoiding the potential digestive issues that can come with gluten consumption, making this cake a healthier option for many.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen raspberries instead of fresh?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen raspberries if fresh ones are not available. However, make sure to thaw and drain them well to avoid excess moisture in the batter.</p>

    <p>If you don’t have buttermilk, you can make a substitute by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar to 1 cup of milk. Let it sit for 5 minutes before using.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil, and use a non-dairy milk in place of buttermilk. Ensure the chocolate chips are also dairy-free.</p>
