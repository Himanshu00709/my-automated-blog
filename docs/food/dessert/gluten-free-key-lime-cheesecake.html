    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free key lime cheesecake:</p>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (163°C). In a medium bowl, combine the crushed gluten-free graham crackers with the melted butter. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, ensuring an even layer. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar, sour cream, key lime juice, and zest, mixing until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, beating just until incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cheesecake. Finally, stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>3. Bake the Cheesecake</h3>
    <p>Pour the filling over the cooled crust and smooth the top with a spatula. Place the springform pan in a larger baking dish and fill the dish with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the springform pan. This water bath helps prevent cracks in the cheesecake. Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle.</p>

    <h3>4. Cool and Chill</h3>
    <p>Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door slightly open for about an hour. This gradual cooling process helps prevent cracks. Once cooled, remove the cheesecake from the oven and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow it to set completely.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>When ready to serve, carefully remove the cheesecake from the springform pan. Garnish with additional key lime zest, whipped cream, or fresh berries for a pop of color and flavor. Slice and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular limes instead of key limes?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular limes if key limes are unavailable. However, key limes have a more intense flavor, so the taste may be slightly different.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How long does this cheesecake last in the fridge?</h3>
        <p>This cheesecake can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I freeze this cheesecake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cheesecake for up to 2 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>
    </div>
