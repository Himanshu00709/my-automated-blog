    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Coffee Mixture</h3>
    <p>Brew a cup of strong coffee and allow it to cool to room temperature. You can add a splash of coffee liqueur or vanilla extract for extra flavor, but this is optional.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Mascarpone Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together until pale and creamy. Add the mascarpone cheese and mix until smooth. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the egg whites into the mascarpone mixture to create a light and airy filling.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Tiramisu</h3>
    <p>Dip each gluten-free ladyfinger into the cooled coffee, ensuring they are moist but not soggy. Arrange a layer of soaked ladyfingers at the bottom of your serving dish. Spread half of the mascarpone filling over the ladyfingers. Repeat the process with another layer of ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone filling.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Cover the tiramisu with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld. Before serving, dust the top with cocoa powder using a fine sieve.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free tiramisu cake offers several health benefits, especially for those with gluten-related disorders. By eliminating gluten, this dessert reduces the risk of triggering symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, and fatigue in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.
