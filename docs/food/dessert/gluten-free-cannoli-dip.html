    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cannoli Dip</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese instead of ricotta?</h3>

        <h3>Can I make this dip ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dip a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. This can actually enhance the flavors as they have more time to meld together.</p>
