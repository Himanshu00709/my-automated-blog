    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Chocolate Mousse Pie</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Gluten-Free Crust</h3>

    <p>The crust is the foundation of any pie, and for a gluten-free version, it's essential to use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend. Start by combining the gluten-free flour with a pinch of salt and cold, unsalted butter. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Press the dough into a pie dish and bake until golden brown. Allow the crust to cool completely before adding the mousse filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Chocolate Mousse</h3>

    <p>The mousse is the star of the show, and achieving the perfect texture is key. Begin by melting high-quality dark chocolate in a double boiler or microwave. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. In another bowl, beat the egg yolks with sugar until pale and fluffy. Gently fold the melted chocolate into the egg mixture, then fold in the whipped cream. Be careful not to overmix, as this can deflate the mousse and result in a denser texture. Pour the mousse into the cooled crust and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until set.</p>

    <h3>3. Serving and Garnishing</h3>

    <p>Once the mousse has set, it's time to serve your gluten-free chocolate mousse pie. For an extra touch of elegance, garnish the pie with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, or fresh berries. Slice the pie with a sharp knife, wiping the blade clean between cuts to ensure neat slices. Serve chilled and enjoy the rich, creamy texture and deep chocolate flavor that makes this dessert a true indulgence.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chocolate Mousse Pie</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use milk chocolate if you prefer a sweeter mousse. However, keep in mind that milk chocolate has a lower cocoa content, which may result in a less intense chocolate flavor. Adjust the sugar accordingly to balance the sweetness.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How long does the pie need to set in the refrigerator?</h3>
        <p>The pie should be refrigerated for at least 4 hours to allow the mousse to set properly. For best results, you can leave it in the refrigerator overnight.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this pie ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! This pie is an excellent make-ahead dessert. You can prepare it up to two days in advance and store it in the refrigerator until ready to serve.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Is this pie suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe contains dairy and eggs, so it is not vegan. However, you can make a vegan version by using dairy-free chocolate, coconut cream, and a vegan egg substitute.</p>
    </div>
