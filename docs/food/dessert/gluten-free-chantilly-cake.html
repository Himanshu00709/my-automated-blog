    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free Chantilly cake:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Cake Batter</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round cake pans. In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. In a separate large bowl, cream the softened butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined.</p>

    <h3>2. Bake the Cake Layers</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>3. Make the Chantilly Cream</h3>
    <p>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the Chantilly cream. In a large bowl, beat the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. In another bowl, beat the cream cheese and powdered sugar together until smooth. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until well combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can deflate the cream.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Cake</h3>
    <p>Once the cakes are completely cool, place one layer on a serving plate and spread a generous amount of Chantilly cream on top. Add a layer of fresh berries, then place the second cake layer on top. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining Chantilly cream. Decorate with additional berries as desired.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chantilly Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. Just make sure it’s a 1:1 substitute for all-purpose flour. Some popular options include almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour blends.</p>

        <h3>2. How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free Chantilly cake should be stored in the refrigerator due to the cream cheese and whipped cream frosting. It will stay fresh for up to 3 days when properly covered.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a dairy-free version by using dairy-free butter, milk, and cream cheese substitutes. However, the texture and flavor may vary slightly from the original recipe.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I freeze the cake?</h3>
        <p>It’s not recommended to freeze the assembled cake due to the cream frosting. However, you can freeze the cake layers separately and frost them after thawing.</p>
