    <h1>Gluten-Free Strawberry Cake: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>When it comes to desserts, few things are as universally loved as a moist, flavorful cake. And when that cake is gluten-free and bursting with the fresh, sweet taste of strawberries, it becomes a treat that everyone can enjoy—regardless of dietary restrictions. Whether you're hosting a summer party, celebrating a special occasion, or simply indulging in a sweet craving, a gluten-free strawberry cake is the perfect choice.

    <h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Strawberry Cake?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason.

But even for those without gluten sensitivities, gluten-free cakes can be a lighter, more digestible option. Strawberries, with their natural sweetness and vibrant color, make an excellent addition to gluten-free cakes, adding both flavor and nutritional value. Strawberries are rich in vitamins, antioxidants, and fiber, making this cake not only delicious but also a healthier dessert option.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free strawberry cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Strawberries:</strong> Wash and hull the strawberries. You can either chop them into small pieces or puree them in a blender for a smoother texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Ensure there are no lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the melted butter (or coconut oil), milk, and vanilla extract. Mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in the strawberries gently.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with fresh strawberries or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Strawberry Cake</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free cake can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll achieve a perfect result every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that is specifically designed for baking, and ensure it contains xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Fresh Strawberries:</strong> While strawberry puree adds flavor, adding some chopped strawberries to the batter can give your cake a delightful texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can sometimes take longer to bake. Keep an eye on the cake and test it with a toothpick to ensure it's fully cooked.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>Can I use frozen strawberries instead of fresh?</h3>

        <h3>Can I make this cake vegan?</h3>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different fruit?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute strawberries with other fruits like blueberries, raspberries, or even peaches. Adjust the sugar quantity based on the sweetness of the fruit.</p>
