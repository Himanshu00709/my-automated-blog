    <h1>Japanese Cheesecake Gluten-Free: A Delightful Guide</h1>
    <p>Japanese cheesecake, often referred to as "cotton cheesecake" or "soufflé cheesecake," is a light, fluffy, and melt-in-your-mouth dessert that has gained immense popularity worldwide. Its unique texture, which is a cross between a traditional cheesecake and a soufflé, makes it a favorite among dessert lovers. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, the good news is that Japanese cheesecake can easily be made gluten-free without compromising its signature texture or flavor. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about making a gluten-free Japanese cheesecake, from ingredients to step-by-step instructions, and answer some common questions along the way.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Japanese Cheesecake Unique?</h2>
    <p>Japanese cheesecake stands out from its Western counterparts due to its airy and jiggly texture. Unlike the dense and rich New York-style cheesecake, Japanese cheesecake is light, fluffy, and has a subtle sweetness. The secret lies in the technique of incorporating whipped egg whites into the batter, which gives the cake its signature rise and softness. Additionally, Japanese cheesecake is typically baked in a water bath, which helps to maintain moisture and prevent cracking.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free Japanese cheesecake requires precision and patience, but the result is well worth the effort. Follow these steps to create your own fluffy masterpiece:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 160°C (320°F). In a large mixing bowl, combine the cream cheese, butter, and milk. Use a double boiler or microwave to gently heat the mixture until it’s smooth and well combined. Once the mixture has cooled slightly, add the egg yolks one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Sift in the gluten-free flour and cornstarch, then add the lemon juice and vanilla extract. Mix until the batter is smooth and free of lumps.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Whip the Egg Whites</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Gradually add the sugar while continuing to whip until the egg whites are glossy and hold stiff peaks. This step is crucial for achieving the cake’s airy texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Batter and Egg Whites</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the cream cheese batter in three additions. Be careful not to overmix, as this can deflate the egg whites and result in a denser cake. The final batter should be light and airy.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake in a Water Bath</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into a prepared cake pan (lined with parchment paper). Place the pan in a larger baking dish and fill the dish with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the cake pan. This water bath will help the cake bake evenly and prevent cracking. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the cake is set but still jiggly in the center.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once baked, turn off the oven and let the cake cool inside with the door slightly ajar for about 30 minutes. This gradual cooling process helps prevent the cake from collapsing. After cooling, remove the cake from the pan and serve at room temperature or chilled.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Japanese Cheesecake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use any gluten-free flour for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any fine gluten-free flour blend, such as rice flour, almond flour, or a pre-mixed gluten-free flour. However, avoid using coarse flours like coconut flour, as they can affect the texture of the cake.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I store gluten-free Japanese cheesecake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cheesecake in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze it for up to a month. To serve, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight.</p>

        <h3>3. Why did my cheesecake collapse?</h3>
        <p>Cheesecakes can collapse if they are overbaked, cooled too quickly, or if the egg whites were not whipped properly. Ensure you follow the recipe closely and allow the cake to cool gradually in the oven.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the cream cheese and butter with dairy-free alternatives. However, the texture and flavor may vary slightly from the traditional version.</p>
