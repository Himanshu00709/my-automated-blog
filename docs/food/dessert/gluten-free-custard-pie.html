    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Custard Pie</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Gluten-Free Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by combining your gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and a pinch of salt in a mixing bowl. Cut in cold butter or coconut oil until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Roll out the dough and press it into a pie dish, then blind bake it at 375°F (190°C) for 10-12 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Custard Filling</h3>
    <p>In a saucepan, heat milk (or a non-dairy alternative) until it’s warm but not boiling. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract. Slowly pour the warm milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly to prevent curdling. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring continuously, until it thickens into a custard consistency.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the custard filling into the pre-baked gluten-free crust. Bake the pie at 350°F (175°C) for 25-30 minutes, or until the custard is set but still slightly jiggly in the center. Allow the pie to cool completely before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Custard Pie</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use almond flour for the crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, almond flour can be used for the crust, but it will result in a denser texture. For a flakier crust, a gluten-free flour blend is recommended.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>2. How do I store gluten-free custard pie?</h3>
        <p>Store the pie in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container, for up to 3 days. The custard may soften over time, so it’s best enjoyed fresh.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>3. Can I make this pie dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the milk with a non-dairy alternative like almond milk, coconut milk, or oat milk, and use coconut oil instead of butter for the crust.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free custard pie is a delightful dessert that proves you don’t need gluten to create something truly delicious. With its creamy custard filling and flaky crust, it’s a treat that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. Whether you’re new to gluten-free baking or a seasoned pro, this pie is sure to become a favorite in your dessert repertoire.
