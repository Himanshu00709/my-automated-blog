    <h1>Gluten-Free Turtle Cheesecake: A Decadent Dessert for Everyone</h1>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your own gluten-free turtle cheesecake:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (163°C). In a medium bowl, combine the crushed gluten-free graham crackers with the melted butter. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until it is smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar, sour cream, and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, beating just until each egg is incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, as this can cause the cheesecake to crack during baking.</p>

    <h3>3. Bake the Cheesecake</h3>
    <p>Pour the filling over the cooled crust and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake the cheesecake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door slightly ajar for about an hour. This gradual cooling process helps prevent cracks.</p>

    <h3>4. Add the Toppings</h3>
    <p>Once the cheesecake has cooled completely, remove it from the springform pan. Drizzle the caramel sauce and melted chocolate over the top of the cheesecake, then sprinkle with chopped pecans. For an extra touch, you can also add a few whole pecans on top.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="faq">

        <h3>3. Can I make this cheesecake dairy-free as well?</h3>
