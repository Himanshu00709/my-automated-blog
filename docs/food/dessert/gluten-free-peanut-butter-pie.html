    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free peanut butter pie.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by crushing your gluten-free graham crackers into fine crumbs. You can do this by placing them in a food processor or by using a rolling pin and a zip-top bag. Mix the crumbs with melted butter and press the mixture into a pie dish, ensuring an even layer across the bottom and up the sides. Bake the crust in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes, then let it cool completely.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until it’s smooth and creamy. Add the peanut butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract, and continue to mix until well combined. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture until fully incorporated. This will give your pie a light and fluffy texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Pour the filling into the cooled crust, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Smooth the top and refrigerate the pie for at least 4 hours, or until it’s firm. For an extra touch, you can drizzle melted chocolate or sprinkle crushed peanuts on top before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Pie</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular graham crackers instead of gluten-free ones?</h3>
        <p>No, regular graham crackers contain gluten, so they are not suitable for a gluten-free diet. Be sure to use gluten-free graham crackers or another gluten-free alternative for the crust.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make this pie dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a dairy-free version by using dairy-free cream cheese and coconut cream instead of heavy cream. Just ensure that all your ingredients are free from dairy and gluten.</p>

        <h3>3. How long does the pie last in the fridge?</h3>
        <p>The pie can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. Make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container to maintain its freshness.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I freeze the pie?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the pie for up to 2 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>
