<h1>Gluten-Free Sourdough Discard: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Gluten-free sourdough baking has gained immense popularity in recent years, especially among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. One of the most intriguing aspects of sourdough baking is the concept of "discard." But what exactly is sourdough discard, and how can you use it in gluten-free baking? In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free sourdough discard, from its benefits to creative ways to use it in your kitchen.</p>

However, before feeding, you must remove a portion of the starter to prevent it from growing too large. This removed portion is called the "discard."</p>

<p>Traditionally, sourdough discard is often thrown away, but it can be repurposed in various recipes. In gluten-free sourdough baking, the discard can be just as valuable as the active starter, offering a tangy flavor and unique texture to your baked goods.</p>
