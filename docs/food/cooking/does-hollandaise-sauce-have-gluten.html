<h1>Does Hollandaise Sauce Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Hollandaise sauce is a classic French sauce known for its rich, buttery flavor and velvety texture. It’s a staple in dishes like Eggs Benedict and is often used to elevate vegetables, fish, and meats. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, understanding whether Hollandaise sauce contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the ingredients of Hollandaise sauce, its potential gluten content, and how to enjoy it safely if you’re following a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What is Hollandaise Sauce?</h2>

<p>Hollandaise sauce is an emulsion of egg yolks, butter, and lemon juice, often seasoned with salt, pepper, and a touch of cayenne. It’s one of the five mother sauces in French cuisine and is known for its creamy, luxurious texture. Traditionally, Hollandaise sauce does not contain flour or any other gluten-containing ingredients, making it naturally gluten-free. However, variations and store-bought versions may introduce gluten, so it’s essential to examine the ingredients carefully.</p>
