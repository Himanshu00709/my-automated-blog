    <h1>Gluten-Free Bulgogi: A Delicious Twist on a Korean Classic</h1>

    <p>Bulgogi, a beloved Korean dish, is known for its savory, sweet, and slightly smoky flavors. Traditionally made with thinly sliced beef marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, and other seasonings, bulgogi is a staple in Korean cuisine. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the traditional recipe can be off-limits due to the presence of soy sauce, which typically contains gluten. Enter gluten-free bulgogi—a delicious and inclusive twist on this classic dish that everyone can enjoy.</p>

    <h2>What is Bulgogi?</h2>

    <p>Bulgogi, which translates to "fire meat," is a Korean dish that dates back to the Goguryeo era (37 BC–668 AD). Originally, it was made with thinly sliced beef that was marinated and then grilled over an open flame. Over time, the dish has evolved, and today, it is commonly prepared on a stovetop or grill pan. The marinade is the star of the dish, infusing the meat with a rich, complex flavor that is both sweet and savory.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to skin rashes and fatigue. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it is commonly present in soy sauce, which is a key ingredient in traditional bulgogi. By making a few simple substitutions, you can enjoy all the flavors of bulgogi without the gluten.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Bulgogi</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free bulgogi is surprisingly simple. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Marinade:</strong> In a bowl, combine the gluten-free soy sauce, sugar (or alternative sweetener), sesame oil, minced garlic, grated ginger, and grated pear or apple (if using). Mix well until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Beef:</strong> Add the thinly sliced beef to the marinade, ensuring each piece is well-coated. Cover the bowl and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Bulgogi:</strong> Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Add the marinated beef in a single layer, cooking for 2-3 minutes on each side until the meat is caramelized and cooked through. Avoid overcrowding the pan to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Once cooked, transfer the bulgogi to a serving plate. Garnish with chopped green onions and sesame seeds. Serve with steamed rice, lettuce wraps, or your favorite gluten-free side dishes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Bulgogi</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Cut of Beef:</strong> For the best results, use a tender cut of beef like sirloin or ribeye. These cuts are naturally tender and will absorb the marinade well.</li>
        <li><strong>Slice the Beef Thinly:</strong> Thin slices of beef will cook quickly and absorb the marinade more effectively. If you’re having trouble slicing the beef thinly, you can partially freeze it for about 30 minutes to make it easier to cut.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Pear or Apple:</strong> The grated pear or apple not only adds sweetness but also helps to tenderize the meat, making it even more succulent.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the Sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a less sweet bulgogi, you can reduce the amount of sugar or use a sugar substitute like stevia.</li>
    </ul>
