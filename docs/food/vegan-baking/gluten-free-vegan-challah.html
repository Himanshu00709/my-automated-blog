    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Vegan Challah</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by mixing your dry ingredients—gluten-free flour, xanthan gum, and a pinch of salt—in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, combine your wet ingredients: flaxseed meal mixed with water (to create a "flax egg"), plant-based milk, maple syrup, and olive oil. Gradually add the wet mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring until a dough forms. The dough will be sticky, but that’s normal for gluten-free baking.</p>

    <h3>2. Knead and Rest the Dough</h3>
    <p>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) and knead it gently for a few minutes. Gluten-free dough doesn’t require extensive kneading like traditional bread dough. Once kneaded, cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This allows the xanthan gum to activate and the dough to firm up.</p>

    <h3>3. Braid the Challah</h3>
    <p>Divide the dough into equal portions and roll them into long ropes. Braid the ropes into your desired shape—three-strand, four-strand, or even a round loaf for special occasions. Place the braided dough on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</p>

    <h3>4. Let It Rise</h3>
    <p>Cover the braided dough with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for about an hour. Gluten-free dough won’t rise as much as traditional dough, but it will still expand slightly.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Before baking, brush the challah with a mixture of plant-based milk and maple syrup to give it a beautiful golden crust. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when tapped.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Vegan Challah</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I freeze gluten-free vegan challah?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze gluten-free vegan challah. Allow it to cool completely, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer-safe bag. It can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply thaw at room temperature and warm in the oven.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I store gluten-free vegan challah?</h3>
        <p>Store your challah in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, keep it in the refrigerator for up to a week. To refresh, lightly toast slices before serving.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I use a different sweetener?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While maple syrup is a popular choice, you can use agave, date syrup, or even coconut sugar. Just keep in mind that liquid sweeteners may slightly alter the texture of the dough.</p>

        <h3>4. Why is my challah dense?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free bread can sometimes be denser than traditional bread due to the lack of gluten. To achieve a lighter texture, make sure to use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend and don’t overwork the dough. Letting the dough rest and rise properly also helps.</p>
