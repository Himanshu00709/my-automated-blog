<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten and dairy-free pasta salad.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Cook the Pasta</h3>
<p>Start by cooking the gluten-free pasta according to the package instructions. Be sure to cook it al dente, as overcooked pasta can become mushy. Once cooked, drain the pasta and rinse it under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set it aside to cool.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Vegetables</h3>
<p>While the pasta is cooling, prepare your vegetables. Wash and chop the cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, and bell peppers. Slice the olives and chop the fresh herbs. Having all your vegetables prepped and ready will make the assembly process much smoother.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Make the Dressing</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. This simple dressing will add a burst of flavor to your pasta salad without the need for dairy or gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Everything</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooled pasta, chopped vegetables, and fresh herbs. Pour the dressing over the top and toss everything together until well combined. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Chill and Serve</h3>
<p>For the best flavor, cover the pasta salad and let it chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld together. Serve cold as a side dish or a light main course.</p>
