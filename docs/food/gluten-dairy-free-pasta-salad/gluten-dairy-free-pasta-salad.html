    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free dairy-free pasta salad:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Pasta</h3>
    <p>Start by boiling your gluten-free pasta according to the package instructions. Be sure to cook it al dente to prevent it from becoming too soft. Once cooked, drain the pasta and rinse it under cold water to stop the cooking process. This will also help remove any excess starch, ensuring your salad isn't sticky.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>While the pasta is cooking, chop your favorite vegetables. Some great options include bell peppers, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, red onions, and spinach. You can also add some roasted vegetables like zucchini or eggplant for an extra layer of flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Protein</h3>
    <p>For a protein boost, consider adding chickpeas, black beans, or cubed tofu. These plant-based proteins not only make the salad more filling but also provide essential nutrients like iron and fiber.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Make the Dressing</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, whisk together your dairy-free dressing. A simple yet delicious option is a mix of olive oil, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and a touch of maple syrup. You can also use tahini or avocado for a creamier texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine and Toss</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta, chopped vegetables, and protein. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss everything together until well-coated. Add fresh herbs like basil, parsley, or cilantro for an extra burst of flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>For the best flavor, let the salad chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld together. Serve cold as a side dish or a main course.</p>
