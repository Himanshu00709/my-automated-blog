    <h1>Gluten-Free Fish Patties: A Healthy and Delicious Alternative</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by both health-conscious individuals and those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Fish</h3>
    <p>Start by rinsing the fish fillets under cold water and patting them dry with a paper towel. Cut the fish into small pieces and place them in a food processor. Pulse until the fish is finely chopped but not pureed. Transfer the fish to a large mixing bowl.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add the gluten-free breadcrumbs, egg, chopped parsley, lemon zest, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper to the bowl with the fish. Mix everything thoroughly until well combined. The mixture should hold together when pressed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Form the Patties</h3>
    <p>Divide the mixture into equal portions and shape them into patties. You should be able to make about 6-8 patties, depending on the size you prefer. Place the patties on a plate and refrigerate for 15-20 minutes to help them firm up.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Patties</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the patties in the skillet. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the patties from the skillet and place them on a paper towel to drain any excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve the gluten-free fish patties with a side of fresh salad, gluten-free buns, or your favorite dipping sauce. They can also be enjoyed as a main dish or as part of a larger meal.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Fish Patties</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free fish patties are not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Fish is an excellent source of high-quality protein, which is essential for muscle repair and growth. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish are known to support heart health, reduce inflammation, and improve brain function. Additionally, using gluten-free breadcrumbs ensures that the patties are suitable for those with gluten sensitivities, making them a safe and healthy option for everyone.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fish Patties</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use frozen fish for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen fish, but make sure to thaw it completely and pat it dry before using it in the recipe. Excess moisture can affect the texture of the patties.</p>

        <h3>2. What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free breadcrumbs, you can use almond flour, crushed gluten-free crackers, or even rolled oats as a substitute.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I bake the patties instead of frying them?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To bake the patties, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and place the patties on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown and cooked through.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store leftover fish patties?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover patties in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them for up to 2 months. Reheat in the oven or skillet before serving.</p>
