    <h1>Gluten-Free Fish Patties: A Healthy and Delicious Alternative</h1>
    <p>In recent years, gluten-free diets have gained immense popularity, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among health-conscious individuals looking to improve their overall well-being. One of the challenges of maintaining a gluten-free diet is finding tasty and satisfying alternatives to traditional dishes.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free fish patties is a straightforward process that requires minimal effort. Follow these steps to create a delicious and healthy meal:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Fish:</strong> Start by finely chopping the fish fillets or pulsing them in a food processor until they reach a minced consistency. Be careful not to over-process, as you want to maintain some texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the minced fish, gluten-free breadcrumbs, eggs, parsley, garlic, lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly until all ingredients are well incorporated.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Patties:</strong> Divide the mixture into equal portions and shape them into patties. Aim for a thickness of about 1 inch to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Patties:</strong> Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the patties in the skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the gluten-free fish patties hot, accompanied by a side salad, gluten-free buns, or your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
