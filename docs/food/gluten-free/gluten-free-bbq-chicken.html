    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free BBQ Chicken</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free BBQ chicken is a straightforward process that involves marinating, grilling, and basting. Follow these steps to achieve tender, flavorful chicken every time:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Start by selecting fresh chicken pieces, such as thighs, drumsticks, or breasts. Remove any excess fat and pat the chicken dry with paper towels. This helps the marinade adhere better to the meat.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Create the Marinade</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, combine your gluten-free BBQ sauce, olive oil, vinegar, and spices. Mix well to create a flavorful marinade. Place the chicken in the marinade, ensuring each piece is fully coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Grill the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade and let any excess drip off. Place the chicken on the grill and cook for about 6-8 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Baste the chicken with additional gluten-free BBQ sauce during the last few minutes of cooking for extra flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the chicken is fully cooked, remove it from the grill and let it rest for 5 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring moist and tender meat. Serve your gluten-free BBQ chicken with your favorite sides, such as grilled vegetables, coleslaw, or a fresh salad.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free BBQ Chicken</h2>

    <p>To elevate your gluten-free BBQ chicken, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Meat Thermometer:</strong> Ensure your chicken is cooked to the proper temperature to avoid undercooking or overcooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add smoked paprika, garlic powder, or chili flakes to your marinade for a unique twist.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Quality BBQ Sauce:</strong> If using store-bought sauce, always check the label for gluten-free certification to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Grill with Care:</strong> Avoid cross-contamination by cleaning your grill thoroughly before cooking gluten-free items.</li>
    </ul>
