    <h1>Best Gluten-Free Sauces: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply choosing to avoid gluten, finding the right sauces can be a challenge. Many traditional sauces contain gluten as a thickening agent or as part of their ingredients. However, the good news is that there are plenty of delicious and safe gluten-free sauces available. In this guide, we’ll explore the best gluten-free sauces, their benefits, and how to incorporate them into your meals.</p>

    <h2>How to Identify Gluten-Free Sauces</h2>
    <p>When shopping for gluten-free sauces, it’s essential to read labels carefully. Here are some tips to help you identify gluten-free sauces:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Look for the Gluten-Free Label:</strong> Many brands now clearly label their products as gluten-free. This is the easiest way to ensure the sauce is safe.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the Ingredients List:</strong> Avoid sauces that contain wheat, barley, rye, or any derivatives of these grains. Also, be cautious of ingredients like malt vinegar, which is derived from barley.</li>
