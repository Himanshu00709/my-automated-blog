    <h1>Gluten-Free Hotteok: A Delicious Twist on a Korean Classic</h1>
    <p>Hotteok, a beloved Korean street food, is a sweet, chewy pancake filled with a gooey mixture of brown sugar, honey, and nuts. Traditionally made with wheat flour, this treat has been a staple in Korean cuisine for generations. However, with the rise of gluten intolerance and celiac disease, many people are seeking gluten-free alternatives to enjoy this delightful snack. Enter gluten-free hotteok—a delicious twist on the classic that caters to those with dietary restrictions without compromising on flavor or texture.</p>

    <h2>What is Hotteok?</h2>
    <p>Hotteok (호떡) is a type of Korean pancake that is typically filled with a sweet mixture of brown sugar, honey, chopped peanuts, and cinnamon. The dough is made from wheat flour, which gives it its characteristic chewy texture. It is cooked on a griddle until the outside is crispy and golden brown, while the inside remains soft and gooey. Hotteok is especially popular during the winter months, as it is often sold by street vendors who serve it piping hot to warm up passersby.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to manage their health. Fortunately, gluten-free hotteok offers a way to enjoy this traditional treat without the adverse effects of gluten.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Hotteok</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free hotteok is easier than you might think. The key is to use a combination of gluten-free flours that mimic the texture of wheat flour. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, tapioca flour, xanthan gum, sugar, and salt. Mix well.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>Add the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>While the dough is rising, prepare the filling by mixing the brown sugar, chopped nuts, and cinnamon in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, divide it into 6 equal portions. Flatten each portion into a small disc and place a spoonful of the filling in the center. Pinch the edges together to seal the filling inside.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add a small amount of vegetable oil. Cook each hotteok for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Hotteok</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a combination of flours:</strong> Gluten-free all-purpose flour and tapioca flour work well together to create a dough that is both chewy and tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t skip the xanthan gum:</strong> Xanthan gum helps to bind the dough and gives it the elasticity that gluten would normally provide.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the dough rise properly:</strong> Allowing the dough to rise for the full hour ensures that it will be light and airy when cooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook on medium heat:</strong> Cooking the hotteok on medium heat ensures that the outside becomes crispy without burning, while the inside remains soft and gooey.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
