    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Hot Dog Chili</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free hot dog chili is a straightforward process. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create a delicious batch:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Brown the Meat</h3>
    <p>Start by browning your ground beef or turkey in a large skillet over medium heat. Break the meat into small pieces as it cooks to ensure even browning. Once the meat is fully cooked, drain any excess fat.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add Aromatics</h3>
    <p>Add finely chopped onions and minced garlic to the skillet. Cook until the onions are translucent and the garlic is fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Incorporate Spices</h3>
    <p>Add your gluten-free spices, such as chili powder, cumin, and paprika, to the skillet. Stir well to coat the meat and aromatics evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Liquids</h3>
    <p>Pour in the tomato sauce and gluten-free beef broth. Stir to combine, then bring the mixture to a simmer. Allow it to cook for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chili thickens.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Finish with Worcestershire Sauce</h3>
    <p>Add a splash of gluten-free Worcestershire sauce for an extra layer of flavor. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Hot Dog Chili</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free hot dog chili turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh onions, garlic, and spices will give your chili the best flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Labels:</strong> Always double-check the labels of pre-packaged ingredients to ensure they are gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Heat:</strong> Customize the heat level by adding more or less chili powder or even a dash of hot sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Let It Simmer:</strong> Allowing the chili to simmer for a longer period will help the flavors meld together.</li>
    </ul>
