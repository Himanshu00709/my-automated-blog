    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Chimichangas</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free chimichangas is a straightforward process that involves preparing the filling, assembling the chimichangas, and frying them to perfection. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the shredded chicken or beef, black beans, shredded cheese, diced tomatoes, chopped onions, cilantro, and gluten-free taco seasoning. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Chimichangas:</strong> Lay out a gluten-free tortilla on a flat surface. Spoon about 1/2 cup of the filling onto the center of the tortilla. Fold the sides of the tortilla over the filling, then roll it up tightly from the bottom to form a burrito shape. Secure with toothpicks if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Chimichangas:</strong> Heat the vegetable oil in a deep skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the chimichangas in the oil, seam side down. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Serve the gluten-free chimichangas hot, garnished with additional cheese, salsa, sour cream, or guacamole as desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Chimichangas</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free chimichangas turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Tortillas:</strong> Not all gluten-free tortillas are created equal. Look for ones that are pliable and won’t crack when folded. Corn tortillas are a popular choice, but almond flour tortillas can also work well.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overfill:</strong> Overfilling the tortillas can make them difficult to roll and may cause them to burst during frying. Stick to about 1/2 cup of filling per chimichanga.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Oil:</strong> For the best results, use fresh vegetable oil for frying. Reusing oil can lead to a less crispy texture and may affect the flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain Well:</strong> After frying, make sure to drain the chimichangas on paper towels to remove excess oil. This will help keep them crispy and prevent them from becoming greasy.</li>
    </ul>
