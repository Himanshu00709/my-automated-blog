    <h1>Gluten-Free Fried Chicken Nashville: A Crispy Delight</h1>
    <p>Nashville hot chicken has taken the culinary world by storm, with its fiery spice blend and crispy exterior. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this Southern delicacy can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free fried chicken Nashville—a dish that combines the bold flavors of traditional hot chicken with a gluten-free twist. In this article, we’ll explore the origins of Nashville hot chicken, how to make it gluten-free, and where to find the best gluten-free versions in Nashville.</p>

    <h2>The Origins of Nashville Hot Chicken</h2>
    <p>Nashville hot chicken is a dish that originated in the 1930s in Nashville, Tennessee. Legend has it that the dish was created as a form of revenge by a scorned lover who wanted to punish her cheating partner with a spicy meal. However, the plan backfired when the partner loved the dish so much that he decided to open a restaurant serving it. Today, Nashville hot chicken is a staple of Southern cuisine, known for its crispy fried chicken coated in a spicy cayenne pepper paste.</p>

Symptoms can range from digestive problems to skin rashes and even neurological issues. Fortunately, with the rise of gluten-free diets, many restaurants and home cooks have started to adapt traditional recipes to be gluten-free, including Nashville hot chicken.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk and hot sauce. Add the chicken pieces and let them marinate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Coating:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free flour blend, cornstarch, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the Chicken:</strong> Remove the chicken from the marinade and dredge each piece in the flour mixture, ensuring an even coating.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Chicken:</strong> Heat the vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large skillet to 350°F (175°C). Fry the chicken pieces until golden brown and cooked through, about 10-12 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Spicy Glaze:</strong> In a small saucepan, combine 1/4 cup of the frying oil with 2-3 tablespoons of cayenne pepper and a pinch of sugar. Heat until the mixture is well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish the Chicken:</strong> Brush the spicy glaze over the fried chicken pieces and serve immediately with pickles and white bread (gluten-free, if needed).</li>
