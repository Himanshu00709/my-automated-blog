    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Florentines</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free Florentines is a relatively simple process, but it does require some attention to detail to achieve the perfect texture and flavor. Here’s a step-by-step guide to making your own gluten-free Florentines at home:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by gathering all your ingredients and measuring them out accurately. This will help ensure that your Florentines turn out perfectly. If you’re using dried fruits, make sure to chop them into small, even pieces so that they distribute evenly throughout the cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, chopped nuts, and dried fruits. Mix them together until they are evenly distributed. This will ensure that each bite of your Florentines has a balanced mix of flavors and textures.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Heat the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a small saucepan, heat the honey (or maple syrup) and butter (or coconut oil) over low heat until the mixture is fully combined and slightly thickened. Be careful not to let it boil, as this can alter the texture of the final product.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the warm honey and butter mixture over the dry ingredients and stir until everything is well combined. The mixture should be sticky but manageable. If it’s too dry, you can add a bit more honey or butter to achieve the right consistency.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Shape the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or your hands, shape the mixture into small, flat rounds and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Make sure to leave enough space between each cookie, as they will spread slightly during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Bake the cookies in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10-12 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Keep a close eye on them, as they can burn quickly due to the high sugar content.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the cookies are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely on the baking sheet. If you’d like, you can drizzle melted chocolate over the top for an extra touch of decadence. Once cooled, your gluten-free Florentines are ready to enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Florentines</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Are gluten-free Florentines healthy?</h3>
        <p>While gluten-free Florentines are a healthier option for those with gluten sensitivities, they are still a treat and should be enjoyed in moderation. They are typically high in sugar and calories due to the honey, dried fruits, and nuts. However, they do provide some nutritional benefits, such as healthy fats from the nuts and fiber from the dried fruits.</p>

        <h3>Can I use other nuts in gluten-free Florentines?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While almonds are the traditional choice, you can use any nuts you prefer, such as pistachios, walnuts, or pecans. Just make sure to chop them finely so that they distribute evenly throughout the cookies.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free Florentines?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free Florentines should be stored in an airtight container at room temperature. They will stay fresh for up to a week. If you live in a humid climate, you may want to store them in the refrigerator to prevent them from becoming too soft.</p>

        <h3>Can I make gluten-free Florentines vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make gluten-free Florentines vegan by substituting the honey with maple syrup and using coconut oil instead of butter. This will give you a delicious vegan version of the classic cookie.</p>
    </div>
