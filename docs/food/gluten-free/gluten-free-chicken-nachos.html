<h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure that your nachos are perfectly melted and crispy when they come out of the oven.</p>

<h3>2. Layer the Ingredients</h3>
<p>On a large baking sheet, spread out a single layer of gluten-free tortilla chips. Sprinkle the shredded chicken evenly over the chips, followed by the black beans, corn, and diced tomatoes. Top with shredded cheese, ensuring that all the ingredients are well-covered.</p>

<h3>3. Bake the Nachos</h3>
<p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is fully melted and bubbly. Keep an eye on the nachos to prevent the chips from burning.</p>

<h3>4. Add Toppings</h3>
<p>Once the nachos are out of the oven, immediately add your desired toppings. Dollop guacamole and sour cream over the nachos, and sprinkle with fresh cilantro. Add jalapeños if you like a bit of heat. Serve with lime wedges on the side for an extra burst of flavor.</p>
