    <h1>Gluten-Free Veal Parmesan: A Delicious and Healthy Twist</h1>

    <p>Veal Parmesan is a classic Italian-American dish that has been enjoyed for generations. Traditionally, it consists of breaded veal cutlets, topped with marinara sauce and melted cheese, then baked to perfection. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, the traditional recipe can be off-limits due to the breadcrumbs used in the breading. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can create a gluten-free version of this beloved dish that is just as delicious and satisfying.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free cooking has come a long way in recent years, with a wide variety of gluten-free flours and breadcrumbs available on the market. These alternatives allow you to recreate the texture and taste of traditional breaded dishes without compromising on quality or flavor.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Veal Cutlets</h3>

    <p>Start by seasoning the veal cutlets with salt and pepper on both sides. In a shallow dish, place the gluten-free flour. In another dish, beat the eggs. In a third dish, place the gluten-free breadcrumbs. Dredge each veal cutlet in the flour, shaking off any excess. Then dip it into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off. Finally, coat the cutlet in the gluten-free breadcrumbs, pressing gently to ensure the breadcrumbs adhere.</p>

    <h3>2. Cook the Veal Cutlets</h3>

    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the breaded veal cutlets and cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the cutlets from the skillet and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Dish</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom. Place the cooked veal cutlets on top of the sauce. Spoon more marinara sauce over each cutlet, then sprinkle with shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Veal Parmesan</h3>

    <p>Bake the veal cutlets in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. If you prefer a more golden and crispy top, you can broil the dish for an additional 2-3 minutes, keeping a close eye to prevent burning.</p>

    <h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once the Veal Parmesan is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh basil if desired, and serve with your favorite gluten-free pasta or a side salad for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Veal Parmesan</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose Quality Ingredients:</strong> Since the dish relies on a few key ingredients, it's important to use high-quality veal, gluten-free breadcrumbs, and a flavorful marinara sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overcrowd the Pan:</strong> When cooking the veal cutlets, make sure not to overcrowd the skillet. This ensures even cooking and a crispy breading.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Cheese:</strong> While mozzarella and Parmesan are traditional, you can experiment with other cheeses like provolone or asiago for a different flavor profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Make It Ahead:</strong> You can prepare the breaded veal cutlets ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator until you're ready to cook and assemble the dish.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Veal Parmesan</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use chicken instead of veal?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily substitute veal with chicken breasts or even turkey cutlets. The cooking process remains the same, though cooking times may vary slightly depending on the thickness of the meat.</p>

        <h3>2. What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have gluten-free breadcrumbs, you can use crushed gluten-free crackers, almond flour, or even gluten-free cornflakes as a substitute. Each option will provide a slightly different texture and flavor.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this dish dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make the dish dairy-free, use a dairy-free cheese alternative for the mozzarella and Parmesan. There are many plant-based cheese options available that melt well and provide a similar flavor.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave until warmed through. Note that the breading may lose some of its crispiness upon reheating.</p>
