    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:</strong> In a small saucepan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the gluten-free flour and whisk continuously for 1-2 minutes to create a roux. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Cook until the sauce thickens, then stir in the nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Sandwich:</strong> Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Place the gluten-free bread slices on a baking sheet. Spread a thin layer of béchamel sauce on each slice. Top two slices with ham and shredded Gruyère cheese, then place the remaining bread slices on top to form sandwiches.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Sandwiches:</strong> Spread the remaining béchamel sauce over the tops of the sandwiches and sprinkle with additional cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Eggs:</strong> While the sandwiches are baking, heat the remaining butter in a skillet over medium heat. Crack the eggs into the skillet and cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove the sandwiches from the oven and place each one on a plate. Top each sandwich with a fried egg and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
