    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation Guide</h2>

    <p>Preparing a gluten-free chicken casserole mix is straightforward and can be customized to suit your preferences. Follow these steps for a foolproof dish:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Start by cooking your chicken. You can boil, bake, or sauté it until fully cooked. Once done, shred or dice the chicken into bite-sized pieces.</p>

    <h3>2. Cook the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>While the chicken is cooking, prepare your vegetables. Steam or sauté them until they are tender but still retain some crunch. This ensures they don’t become mushy when baked.</p>

    <h3>3. Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a saucepan, combine your gluten-free thickening agent (like cornstarch) with gluten-free broth. Whisk continuously over medium heat until the mixture thickens. Add seasonings and cheese, stirring until the cheese melts and the sauce is smooth.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked chicken, vegetables, and sauce. Mix well to ensure everything is evenly coated.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish. If desired, top with additional cheese or gluten-free breadcrumbs for a crispy finish. Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</p>
