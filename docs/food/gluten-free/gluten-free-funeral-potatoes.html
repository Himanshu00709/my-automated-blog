    <h1>Gluten-Free Funeral Potatoes: A Comforting Classic Made Safe for All</h1>
    <p>Funeral potatoes, a beloved comfort food often served at gatherings and potlucks, are a staple in many households. Traditionally made with ingredients like cream of chicken soup and shredded cheese, this dish is creamy, cheesy, and utterly satisfying. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic dish can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free funeral potatoes—a delicious adaptation that ensures everyone can partake in this comforting tradition.</p>

    <h2>What Are Funeral Potatoes?</h2>
    <p>Funeral potatoes, also known as cheesy potato casserole, are a popular dish in the United States, particularly in the Midwest. The name originates from their frequent appearance at post-funeral gatherings, where they provide comfort and warmth to grieving families. The dish typically consists of shredded potatoes, cheese, sour cream, and a creamy soup base, all topped with a crunchy topping like cornflakes or crushed crackers.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it often hides in unexpected places, such as canned soups and processed foods. By making funeral potatoes gluten-free, you can ensure that everyone at the table can enjoy this comforting dish without worry.</p>

    <p>Making gluten-free funeral potatoes is surprisingly simple. Follow these steps to create a dish that’s just as comforting and delicious as the original:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven</strong> to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>

        <li><strong>Transfer the mixture</strong> to the prepared baking dish and spread it evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the topping</strong> by crushing gluten-free cornflakes or crackers and mixing them with melted butter. Sprinkle this mixture over the potato base.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Funeral Potatoes</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free funeral potatoes turn out perfectly, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check labels carefully:</strong> Even if an ingredient seems gluten-free, always double-check the packaging to ensure it hasn’t been processed in a facility that handles gluten.</li>

        <li><strong>Experiment with toppings:</strong> If you can’t find gluten-free cornflakes, try using crushed gluten-free potato chips or even a layer of extra cheese for a different texture.</li>
