    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Crepes</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free crepes is similar to making traditional crepes, with a few adjustments to ensure the batter has the right consistency. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup gluten-free flour (e.g., rice flour, almond flour)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups milk (dairy or non-dairy)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or oil</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar (optional, for sweet crepes)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour and salt. If you’re making sweet crepes, add the sugar at this stage.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and then add the milk and melted butter or oil. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, whisking continuously to avoid lumps. The batter should be smooth and slightly runny.</li>
        <li>Let the batter rest for at least 30 minutes. This allows the flour to absorb the liquid and results in a better texture.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat. Lightly grease the pan with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour a small amount of batter into the pan, swirling it around to create a thin, even layer.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 1-2 minutes, or until the edges start to lift and the bottom is lightly browned. Flip the crepe and cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, stacking the cooked crepes on a plate as you go.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Crepes</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free crepes can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a non-stick pan:</strong> A good non-stick pan is essential for making crepes, as it prevents the batter from sticking and tearing.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the batter rest:</strong> Allowing the batter to rest helps the flour absorb the liquid, resulting in a smoother batter and better texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the consistency:</strong> If the batter is too thick, add a little more milk. If it’s too thin, add a bit more flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook on medium heat:</strong> Cooking crepes on medium heat ensures they cook evenly without burning.</li>
        <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> The first crepe might not turn out perfectly, but don’t worry. It often takes a bit of practice to get the hang of it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Crepes</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make gluten-free crepes ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make gluten-free crepes ahead of time. Simply stack them with parchment paper in between to prevent sticking, and store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them for up to 2 months.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of eggs in gluten-free crepes?</h3>
        <p>If you need to avoid eggs, you can use a flaxseed or chia seed egg substitute. To make a flaxseed egg, mix 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed with 3 tablespoons of water and let it sit for 5 minutes until it thickens. Use this mixture in place of one egg.</p>

        <h3>Are gluten-free crepes healthier than regular crepes?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free crepes can be healthier if you use nutrient-dense flours like almond flour or chickpea flour. However, the overall healthiness depends on the ingredients you use and how you prepare them. For example, using whole, unprocessed ingredients and avoiding excessive sugar can make your crepes healthier.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a blender to make the batter?</h3>
        <p>Yes, using a blender can help you achieve a smooth batter quickly. Simply add all the ingredients to the blender and blend until smooth. Let the batter rest for 30 minutes before cooking.</p>
    </div>
