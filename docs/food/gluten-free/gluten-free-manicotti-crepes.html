    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Crepe Batter</h3>

    <p>Start by making the crepe batter. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, eggs, milk, and salt until smooth. The batter should be thin and pourable. If it’s too thick, add a little more milk. Let the batter rest for about 10 minutes to allow the flour to hydrate.</p>

    <h3>2. Cook the Crepes</h3>

    <p>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly grease it with olive oil. Pour about 1/4 cup of the batter into the skillet, swirling it around to form a thin, even layer. Cook for about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until lightly golden. Repeat with the remaining batter, stacking the cooked crepes on a plate.</p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Filling</h3>

    <p>In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, and Italian seasoning. This creamy mixture will be the filling for your manicotti crepes.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Manicotti</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Take each crepe and spoon about 2-3 tablespoons of the cheese mixture onto the center. Roll the crepe around the filling and place it seam-side down in the baking dish. Repeat with the remaining crepes and filling.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake and Serve</h3>

    <p>Once all the crepes are assembled in the baking dish, pour the remaining tomato sauce over the top. Sprinkle with additional mozzarella and Parmesan cheese if desired. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbly and the cheese is melted and golden. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Manicotti Crepes</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make the crepes ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the crepes a day in advance. Simply stack them with parchment paper in between to prevent sticking, and store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator. When you’re ready to assemble the manicotti, let the crepes come to room temperature before filling and rolling.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free manicotti crepes?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can freeze the assembled manicotti before baking. Wrap the baking dish tightly with plastic wrap and aluminum foil, and freeze for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to bake, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and then bake as directed.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of ricotta cheese?</h3>
        <p>If you’re not a fan of ricotta, you can substitute it with cottage cheese, mascarpone, or even a dairy-free alternative like tofu ricotta. The key is to maintain a creamy texture for the filling.</p>

        <h3>Is there a gluten-free flour blend you recommend?</h3>
        <p>There are many great gluten-free flour blends available, such as Bob’s Red Mill 1-to-1 Baking Flour or King Arthur Measure for Measure Flour. These blends are designed to work well in a variety of recipes, including crepes.</p>
