    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free corn fritters is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create a batch of delicious fritters:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Batter:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, salt, and black pepper. Whisk in the eggs and milk until you have a smooth batter. Fold in the corn kernels and chopped herbs if using.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong> In a large skillet, heat about 1/4 inch of oil over medium heat. The oil should be hot but not smoking.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Fritters:</strong> Using a spoon or a small ladle, drop portions of the batter into the hot oil. Flatten slightly with the back of the spoon to form fritters.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry Until Golden:</strong> Cook the fritters for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove from the oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Warm:</strong> Serve the gluten-free corn fritters warm with your favorite dipping sauce, such as sour cream, salsa, or aioli.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Corn Fritters</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free corn fritters turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Corn:</strong> Fresh corn kernels will give your fritters a sweeter and more vibrant flavor. However, frozen corn can be a convenient alternative.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense fritters. Mix the batter just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Control the Oil Temperature:</strong> If the oil is too hot, the fritters will burn on the outside before cooking through. If it’s too cool, they will absorb too much oil and become greasy.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add other ingredients like diced bell peppers, jalapeños, or cheese to customize your fritters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Corn Fritters</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I bake gluten-free corn fritters instead of frying them?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake gluten-free corn fritters for a healthier option. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and place the fritters on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of eggs in gluten-free corn fritters?</h3>
        <p>If you’re looking for an egg-free option, you can use a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) or a commercial egg replacer. These alternatives will help bind the ingredients together.</p>

        <h3>Can I make gluten-free corn fritters ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the batter ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. When you’re ready to cook, give the batter a quick stir before frying.</p>

        <h3>Are gluten-free corn fritters suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>With a few modifications, gluten-free corn fritters can be made vegan. Use a plant-based milk and an egg substitute like a flax egg or chia egg. Ensure that all other ingredients are vegan-friendly as well.</p>
