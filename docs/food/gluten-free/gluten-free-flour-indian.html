    <h1>Gluten-Free Flour in Indian Cuisine: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Indian cuisine is renowned for its rich flavors, diverse ingredients, and intricate cooking techniques. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying traditional Indian dishes can be challenging due to the widespread use of wheat-based flours.

Gluten-free flours, derived from grains, nuts, and legumes, provide a safe alternative for those who need to avoid gluten. In Indian cuisine, where wheat flour is a staple, gluten-free flours offer a way to enjoy traditional dishes without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>How to Use Gluten-Free Flours in Indian Recipes</h2>

    <p>Transitioning to gluten-free flours in Indian cooking may seem daunting, but with a few tips and tricks, you can easily adapt your favorite recipes. Here are some guidelines to help you get started:</p>

    <h3>1. Experiment with Blends</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free flours often have different textures and flavors compared to wheat flour. To achieve the best results, consider blending different gluten-free flours. For example, a mix of rice flour and chickpea flour can create a balanced texture for dosas or chillas.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free flours tend to absorb more liquid than wheat flour. When using them in recipes, you may need to adjust the amount of water or other liquids to achieve the desired consistency. Start with a smaller amount of liquid and gradually add more as needed.</p>

    <h3>3. Use Binding Agents</h3>
    <p>Since gluten-free flours lack the elasticity of wheat flour, you may need to add binding agents like xanthan gum or psyllium husk to help hold the dough together. This is especially important for recipes like rotis or parathas.</p>

    <h3>4. Be Mindful of Cooking Times</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free flours may cook faster or slower than wheat flour, depending on the type. Keep an eye on your dishes and adjust cooking times accordingly to prevent overcooking or undercooking.</p>
