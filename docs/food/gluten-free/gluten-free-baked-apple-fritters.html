    <p>Gluten-free baked apple fritters are not only a great option for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but they can also be a healthier choice for anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake. Baking instead of frying the fritters reduces the amount of oil used, making them lower in calories and fat. Additionally, using gluten-free flours can add extra nutrients and fiber to your diet.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. This will prevent the fritters from sticking and make cleanup easier.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the applesauce, egg, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth. This mixture will add moisture and flavor to your fritters.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the fritters dense. Gently fold in the diced apples.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Shape and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop portions of the batter onto the prepared baking sheet. Flatten them slightly with the back of the spoon. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the fritters are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the fritters to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack. If desired, dust with powdered sugar before serving.</p>
