    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cookie Dough</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Is gluten-free cookie dough safe to eat raw?</h3>
        <p>While gluten-free cookie dough eliminates the risk of gluten-related issues, it’s important to note that raw dough can still contain raw eggs and uncooked flour, which may pose a risk of foodborne illness. If you want to enjoy raw dough safely, look for recipes that use heat-treated flour and omit eggs, or use egg substitutes.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free cookie dough?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free cookie dough freezes well. Simply portion the dough into balls, place them on a baking sheet, and freeze until solid. Once frozen, transfer the dough balls to a zip-top bag or airtight container. They can be baked directly from the freezer, though you may need to add a few extra minutes to the baking time.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best flour for gluten-free cookie dough?</h3>
        <p>The best flour for gluten-free cookie dough depends on your preferences and dietary needs. Almond flour is popular for its rich flavor and moist texture, while coconut flour is highly absorbent and works well in combination with other flours. Rice flour and oat flour are also great options for a neutral taste and light texture.</p>
