    <h1>Gluten-Free Scarpaccia: A Delicious Italian Delight</h1>
    <p>Scarpaccia, a traditional Italian dish originating from Tuscany, is a savory zucchini tart that has been enjoyed for centuries. Its name, which translates to "old shoe," is a playful nod to its rustic appearance. Traditionally made with wheat flour, this dish has been reimagined for those following a gluten-free diet, offering a delicious and healthy alternative without compromising on flavor. In this article, we’ll explore the history of scarpaccia, its gluten-free adaptation, and how you can make this delightful dish at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Scarpaccia</h2>
    <p>Scarpaccia has its roots in the Tuscan countryside, where it was traditionally prepared as a way to use up an abundance of summer zucchini.

Over time, scarpaccia has evolved, with variations including the addition of herbs, cheese, and even sweet versions with apples or pears. The gluten-free version of scarpaccia is a modern twist on this classic dish, catering to those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity in recent years, not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals seeking to improve their overall health.

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Scarpaccia</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your own gluten-free scarpaccia:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Zucchini:</strong> Wash and thinly slice the zucchini. You can use a mandoline slicer for even slices.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Batter:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, eggs, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Add the fresh herbs and mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Ingredients:</strong> Gently fold the sliced zucchini into the batter, ensuring each slice is well-coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Pour the mixture into a greased baking dish and spread it evenly. If desired, sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook:</strong> Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the center is set.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Allow the scarpaccia to cool slightly before slicing and serving. Enjoy it warm or at room temperature.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Scarpaccia</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free scarpaccia turns out perfectly, consider the following tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Opt for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, such as a mix of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense texture. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Herbs:</strong> Fresh herbs add a burst of flavor to the dish. If you don’t have fresh herbs on hand, you can use dried herbs, but reduce the quantity by half.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> While Parmesan cheese is a classic topping, feel free to experiment with other cheeses or even a sprinkle of chili flakes for a bit of heat.</li>
    </ul>
