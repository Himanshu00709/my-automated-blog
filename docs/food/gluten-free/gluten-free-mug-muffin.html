<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Making a gluten-free mug muffin is incredibly easy and takes just a few minutes. Follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Mug:</strong> Choose a microwave-safe mug and lightly grease it with oil or cooking spray to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In the mug, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir well to ensure even distribution.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> Add the milk, egg (or flaxseed egg), sweetener, and oil to the mug. Mix thoroughly until the batter is smooth and free of lumps.</li>
    <li><strong>Microwave:</strong> Place the mug in the microwave and cook on high for 1-2 minutes. Cooking time may vary depending on your microwave, so start with 1 minute and check for doneness.

    <li><strong>Nutty Delight Mug Muffin:</strong> Stir in a tablespoon of your favorite nut butter, such as almond or peanut butter, for a rich and nutty flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Savory Mug Muffin:</strong> Skip the sweetener and add grated cheese, herbs, and a pinch of garlic powder for a savory twist.</li>
