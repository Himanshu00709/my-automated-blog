    <h1>Dos Toros Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, and for good reason. With more people being diagnosed with celiac disease or choosing a gluten-free lifestyle for health reasons, restaurants have had to adapt.

Additionally, some people choose a gluten-free diet for perceived health benefits, such as improved digestion or reduced inflammation.</p>
