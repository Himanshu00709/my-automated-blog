In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free options available at Rib Crib, provide tips for dining safely, and answer some frequently asked questions about gluten-free dining at this beloved barbecue spot.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining</h2>
    <p>Before diving into the specifics of Rib Crib’s menu, it’s important to understand what it means to eat gluten-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.

Therefore, it’s crucial for these individuals to avoid gluten entirely.</p>
    <p>When dining out, cross-contamination is a significant concern. Even if a dish is inherently gluten-free, it can become contaminated if it comes into contact with gluten-containing foods during preparation. This is why it’s essential to communicate your dietary needs clearly to the restaurant staff.</p>
