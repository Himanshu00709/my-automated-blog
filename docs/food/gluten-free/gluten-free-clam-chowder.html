    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Clams</h3>
    <p>If you're using fresh clams, start by cleaning them thoroughly under cold running water. Discard any clams that are open or cracked. Steam the clams in a large pot with a little water until they open, about 5-10 minutes. Remove the clams from their shells and chop the meat into bite-sized pieces. Reserve the clam juice for later use.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, celery, and garlic, and sauté until the vegetables are soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Stir in the gluten-free flour and cook for another 2 minutes, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Broth and Potatoes</h3>
    <p>Gradually whisk in the chicken or vegetable broth, ensuring that the mixture is smooth. Add the diced potatoes and bring the soup to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 15-20 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Incorporate the Clams and Cream</h3>
    <p>Once the potatoes are cooked, add the chopped clams and reserved clam juice to the pot. Stir in the heavy cream and season the soup with salt and pepper to taste. Let the chowder simmer for another 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Ladle the gluten-free clam chowder into bowls and garnish with fresh parsley if desired. Serve hot with gluten-free crackers or crusty bread for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Clam Chowder</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use canned clams instead of fresh clams?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use canned clams if fresh clams are not available. Just be sure to drain and rinse them before adding to the soup. You can also use the liquid from the canned clams as part of the broth.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of heavy cream?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer a dairy-free option, you can substitute heavy cream with coconut milk. It will give the chowder a slightly different flavor but will still be creamy and delicious.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover clam chowder?</h3>
        <p>Leftover clam chowder can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop, adding a little broth or cream if the soup has thickened too much.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free clam chowder?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze gluten-free clam chowder for up to 2 months. However, the texture of the potatoes and cream may change slightly upon thawing. To reheat, thaw the soup in the refrigerator overnight and then warm it on the stovetop.</p>
    </div>
