    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free buffalo chicken nuggets is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a delicious and healthy snack or meal:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Start by cutting the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces. Season the chicken with salt and pepper to taste. This will help enhance the flavor of the nuggets.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Coat the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Set up a breading station with three bowls: one with gluten-free flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with gluten-free breadcrumbs. Dip each piece of chicken first into the flour, then into the egg, and finally into the breadcrumbs, ensuring each piece is fully coated.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Nuggets</h3>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the coated chicken pieces and cook until golden brown and crispy on all sides. Alternatively, you can bake the nuggets in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Toss in Buffalo Sauce</h3>
    <p>Once the nuggets are cooked, transfer them to a large bowl and toss them with buffalo sauce until evenly coated. You can adjust the amount of sauce to suit your preference for spiciness.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve the gluten-free buffalo chicken nuggets hot with your favorite dipping sauces, such as ranch or blue cheese dressing, and a side of celery sticks for a complete buffalo chicken experience.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free buffalo chicken nuggets offer several nutritional benefits, especially when compared to their traditional counterparts. By using gluten-free ingredients, you can reduce the overall calorie and carbohydrate content while increasing the protein and healthy fat content, depending on the type of flour and breadcrumbs you use.</p>

    <p>For example, almond flour is rich in healthy fats, protein, and fiber, making it a nutritious alternative to traditional wheat flour. Additionally, baking the nuggets instead of frying them can further reduce the calorie and fat content, making them a healthier option for those watching their weight or managing their cholesterol levels.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these nuggets ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the nuggets ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator for up to 2 days before cooking. Alternatively, you can freeze the uncooked nuggets for up to 3 months and cook them directly from frozen when ready to eat.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of buffalo sauce?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer a milder flavor, you can use a different type of sauce, such as barbecue sauce, honey mustard, or even a simple garlic butter sauce. The choice of sauce is entirely up to you and can be customized to suit your taste preferences.</p>

        <h3>Are these nuggets suitable for a keto diet?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free buffalo chicken nuggets can be made keto-friendly by using almond flour or coconut flour for the coating and ensuring that the buffalo sauce you use is low in sugar. This makes them a great option for those following a ketogenic diet.</p>
