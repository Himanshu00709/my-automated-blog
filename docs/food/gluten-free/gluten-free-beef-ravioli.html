    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>

        <li><strong>Assemble the Ravioli:</strong> Roll out the dough into thin sheets. Place small spoonfuls of the beef filling on one sheet, leaving space between each. Cover with another sheet of dough and press around the edges to seal. Cut into individual ravioli using a knife or pasta cutter.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Ravioli:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the ravioli and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain and serve with your favorite sauce.</li>
