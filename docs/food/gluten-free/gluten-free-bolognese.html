    <h1>Gluten-Free Bolognese: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>Bolognese sauce, a classic Italian dish, is beloved for its rich, hearty flavors. Traditionally made with ground meat, tomatoes, and a variety of vegetables, it's a staple in many households. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying a traditional Bolognese can be challenging due to the presence of gluten in many pasta varieties and sometimes even in the sauce itself. Enter gluten-free Bolognese—a delicious and healthy alternative that doesn't compromise on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Bolognese Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>To make a gluten-free Bolognese, the key is to ensure that all ingredients used are free from gluten. This includes the pasta, any thickening agents, and even the broth or wine used in the sauce. Here’s a breakdown of the essential components:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Alternative</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Pasta</td>
                <td>Gluten-free pasta made from rice, corn, quinoa, or legumes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Flour (for thickening)</td>
                <td>Cornstarch, arrowroot powder, or gluten-free flour blends</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Broth</td>
                <td>Gluten-free vegetable or meat broth</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Wine</td>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Bolognese</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free Bolognese is surprisingly simple and follows the same basic steps as traditional Bolognese. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 celery stalk, finely chopped</li>

        <li>1 can (400g) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 cup gluten-free beef or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup red wine (optional, ensure it's gluten-free)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Gluten-free pasta of your choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>

        <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Let it cook for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook your gluten-free pasta according to the package instructions.</li>
        <li>Serve the Bolognese sauce over the cooked pasta, garnished with fresh basil or grated Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
