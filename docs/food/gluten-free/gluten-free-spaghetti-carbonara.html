    <h1>Gluten-Free Spaghetti Carbonara: A Delicious Twist on a Classic</h1>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Gluten-Free Spaghetti</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gluten-free spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Be careful not to overcook, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy. Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Pancetta</h3>
    <p>While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta or bacon and cook until it becomes crispy and golden brown. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, being careful not to burn it.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Pecorino Romano cheese until well combined. Season with freshly ground black pepper.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Everything</h3>
    <p>Once the pasta is cooked and drained, add it to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss to combine. Remove the skillet from the heat and quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture, stirring continuously to create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve</h3>
    <p>Serve the gluten-free Spaghetti Carbonara immediately, garnished with additional grated Pecorino Romano cheese and a sprinkle of black pepper.</p>
