    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Gluten-Free Spaghetti</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gluten-free spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Be careful not to overcook, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy. Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Pancetta</h3>
    <p>While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or bacon and cook until crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, stirring frequently to prevent burning.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Carbonara Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Parmesan cheese until well combined. Season with freshly ground black pepper and a pinch of salt.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Pasta and Sauce</h3>
    <p>Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta and garlic. Toss to combine. Remove the skillet from the heat and quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture, stirring continuously to create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water, a tablespoon at a time, until you reach the desired consistency.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve the gluten-free spaghetti carbonara immediately, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of black pepper. Pair it with a fresh green salad or steamed vegetables for a complete meal.</p>
