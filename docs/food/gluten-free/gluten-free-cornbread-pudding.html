    <h1>Gluten-Free Cornbread Pudding: A Delicious and Healthy Twist</h1>
    <p>Cornbread pudding is a classic comfort food that brings warmth and nostalgia to any meal.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a baking dish with butter or a non-stick cooking spray to prevent the pudding from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free cornmeal, gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these dry ingredients together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, honey (or maple syrup), melted butter, and vanilla extract. Ensure the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense pudding.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cornbread pudding to cool slightly before serving. It pairs wonderfully with soups, stews, or even as a standalone dessert with a drizzle of honey or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the milk with a dairy-free alternative like almond milk or oat milk, and use a dairy-free butter substitute. The result will be just as delicious.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour to use?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour and coconut flour are excellent choices for gluten-free baking. They add a subtle nutty flavor and a moist texture to the pudding. You can also use a pre-made gluten-free flour blend if you prefer.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other ingredients to the pudding?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize your gluten-free cornbread pudding by adding ingredients like fresh corn kernels, diced jalapeños, or shredded cheese. These additions can enhance the flavor and texture of the dish.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover cornbread pudding in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat it in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
