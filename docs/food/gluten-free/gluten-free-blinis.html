<h1>Gluten-Free Blinis: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

<p>Blinis, the traditional Russian pancakes, have been a staple in Eastern European cuisine for centuries. These small, fluffy pancakes are typically made with wheat flour, making them unsuitable for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets, gluten-free blinis have emerged as a delicious and healthy alternative. In this article, we will explore the world of gluten-free blinis, their benefits, and how you can make them at home.</p>

<h2>What Are Gluten-Free Blinis?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free blinis are a variation of the traditional blini recipe, where wheat flour is replaced with gluten-free alternatives such as almond flour, buckwheat flour, or a gluten-free flour blend. These pancakes are just as fluffy and delicious as their traditional counterparts but are safe for those who need to avoid gluten. They can be enjoyed with a variety of toppings, from savory options like smoked salmon and cream cheese to sweet options like fresh berries and honey.</p>
