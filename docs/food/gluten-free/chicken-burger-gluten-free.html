    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your own gluten-free chicken burger:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Patties:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the ground chicken, gluten-free breadcrumbs, egg, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Patties:</strong> Divide the mixture into four equal portions and shape them into patties. Ensure they are evenly sized for consistent cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Patties:</strong> Heat a grill or skillet over medium heat. Cook the patties for about 5-6 minutes on each side, or until they reach an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Toast the Buns:</strong> While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the gluten-free burger buns on the grill or in a toaster.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Burger:</strong> Place a cooked patty on the bottom half of each bun. Add your desired toppings, such as lettuce, tomato, and avocado. Top with the other half of the bun and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Chicken Burgers</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free chicken burgers are not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Chicken is an excellent source of lean protein, which is essential for muscle repair and growth. The use of gluten-free breadcrumbs and buns often means that the burger is lower in carbohydrates and higher in fiber, especially if almond or coconut flour is used. Additionally, the inclusion of fresh vegetables like lettuce, tomato, and avocado adds vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats to the meal.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>1. Can I use other meats instead of chicken?</h3>

        <h3>2. Are gluten-free buns necessary?</h3>
        <p>If you are strictly following a gluten-free diet, then yes, gluten-free buns are necessary. However, you can also enjoy the patty without a bun or use lettuce wraps as a low-carb alternative.</p>
