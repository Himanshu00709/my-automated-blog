    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Filling</h3>

    <p>Start by heating a large skillet over medium heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil, then sauté the chopped onion and minced garlic until they become translucent and fragrant. Next, add the ground beef to the skillet, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Once the beef is browned, drain any excess fat and stir in the gluten-free taco seasoning. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>2. Assemble the Taquitos</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) if you plan to bake the taquitos. Alternatively, you can fry them in a skillet with olive oil. Lay out a gluten-free tortilla and spoon about 2 tablespoons of the beef mixture onto the lower third of the tortilla. Sprinkle a bit of shredded cheese on top of the beef. Roll the tortilla tightly around the filling, securing it with a toothpick if necessary. Repeat this process with the remaining tortillas and filling.</p>

    <h3>3. Cook the Taquitos</h3>

    <p>If baking, place the rolled taquitos seam-side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the tops lightly with olive oil to help them crisp up. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the taquitos are golden brown and crispy. If frying, heat the remaining olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry the taquitos in batches, turning them occasionally, until they are golden and crispy on all sides. Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</p>

    <h3>4. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once the taquitos are cooked, let them cool for a few minutes before serving. They pair wonderfully with gluten-free salsa, guacamole, or sour cream. Garnish with fresh cilantro or a squeeze of lime juice for an extra burst of flavor.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Beef Taquitos</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Tortillas:</strong> Not all gluten-free tortillas are created equal. Look for ones that are pliable and won’t crack when rolled. Corn tortillas are a classic choice, but almond flour tortillas can also work well.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overfill:</strong> Overfilling the taquitos can make them difficult to roll and may cause them to burst open during cooking. Stick to about 2 tablespoons of filling per taquito.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Toothpicks:</strong> If your taquitos are prone to unrolling, secure them with toothpicks before cooking. Just remember to remove the toothpicks before serving!</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Fillings:</strong> While beef is a classic choice, you can also try other fillings like shredded chicken, black beans, or even a vegetarian option with sautéed vegetables.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Beef Taquitos</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I make gluten-free beef taquitos ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the taquitos ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before cooking. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months. Just make sure to wrap them tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn.</p>

        <h3>2. Are gluten-free tortillas healthier than regular tortillas?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free tortillas can be a healthier option for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. However, it’s important to read the labels, as some gluten-free products may contain added sugars or preservatives. Opt for tortillas made with whole, natural ingredients for the healthiest choice.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While this recipe calls for ground beef, you can easily substitute it with ground turkey, chicken, or even pork. Each type of meat will bring its own unique flavor to the dish.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store leftover taquitos?</h3>
        <p>Leftover taquitos can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, place them in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes, or until heated through. This will help them retain their crispiness.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

With the right ingredients and a little bit of effort, you can create a dish that’s not only delicious but also suitable for those with dietary restrictions.
