    <h1>Gluten-Free Blinis for Caviar: A Gourmet Delight</h1>

    <p>When it comes to gourmet dining, few pairings are as iconic as blinis and caviar. These delicate, bite-sized pancakes have been a staple in Russian and Eastern European cuisine for centuries, often served as a luxurious accompaniment to the finest caviar. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional blinis are off the menu. Enter gluten-free blinis—a modern twist on a classic that allows everyone to indulge in this exquisite culinary experience.</p>

    <h2>What Are Blinis?</h2>

    <p>Blinis are small, fluffy pancakes traditionally made from buckwheat flour, which gives them a slightly nutty flavor.

    <p>With the increasing prevalence of gluten intolerance and celiac disease, there has been a growing demand for gluten-free alternatives to traditional foods. Gluten-free blinis are made using alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or a gluten-free flour blend. These substitutes not only cater to those with dietary restrictions but also offer a unique flavor profile that can enhance the overall dining experience.</p>
