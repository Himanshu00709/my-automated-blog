    <h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Spinach Fettuccine Noodles</h2>
    <p>Cooking gluten-free spinach fettuccine noodles is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to keep in mind. Here’s a step-by-step guide to ensure your noodles come out perfectly al dente:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil Water:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Gluten-free pasta often requires more water to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Noodles:</strong> Gently add the noodles to the boiling water. Stir occasionally to prevent clumping.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Al Dente:</strong> Follow the package instructions for cooking time, but start checking the noodles a minute or two before the suggested time. Gluten-free pasta can go from al dente to mushy quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Rinse:</strong> Once cooked, drain the noodles in a colander. Some people prefer to rinse gluten-free pasta with cold water to remove excess starch, but this is optional.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Immediately:</strong> Toss the noodles with your favorite sauce and serve immediately for the best texture and flavor.</li>
    </ol>
