    <h1>Does Kaju Katli Have Gluten? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Kaju Katli, also known as Kaju Barfi, is a popular Indian sweet made primarily from cashew nuts, sugar, and ghee. It is a staple during festivals, weddings, and celebrations. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets and awareness about gluten-related health issues, many people are curious to know whether this beloved dessert contains gluten. In this article, we will explore the ingredients of Kaju Katli, its gluten content, and provide answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Does It Matter?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It acts as a binding agent, giving elasticity to dough and helping it rise. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergy, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues. Symptoms may include digestive problems, fatigue, skin rashes, and even long-term damage to the intestines.</p>

    <p>Given the potential health risks, it is essential for individuals with gluten-related disorders to carefully monitor their diet and avoid foods containing gluten. This brings us to the question: Does Kaju Katli contain gluten?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients of Kaju Katli</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Kaju Katli has gluten, let’s first examine its traditional ingredients:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten Content</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Cashew Nuts (Kaju)</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sugar</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Ghee (Clarified Butter)</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cardamom (Optional)</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Silver Leaf (Optional)</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Kaju Katli</h2>

        <li><strong>Thickening Agents:</strong> In rare cases, thickening agents like wheat flour might be used to alter the texture of Kaju Katli. This is uncommon but possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To ensure that your Kaju Katli is gluten-free, it is best to prepare it at home or purchase it from a trusted brand that clearly labels its products as gluten-free.</p>
