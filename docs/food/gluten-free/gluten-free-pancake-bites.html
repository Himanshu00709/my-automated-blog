    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a mini muffin tin.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk, vanilla extract, and sweetener. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Combine the wet and dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Fold in any optional add-ins, such as blueberries or chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Spoon the batter into the prepared mini muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the pancake bites are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the pancake bites to cool slightly before removing them from the tin. Serve warm with your favorite toppings, such as syrup, yogurt, or fresh fruit.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pancake Bites</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free pancake bites turn out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Different gluten-free flours have different textures and flavors. Experiment with almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free flour blend to find your favorite.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to dense pancake bites. Mix until just combined to keep them light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Mini Muffin Tin:</strong> A mini muffin tin is ideal for creating bite-sized pancake bites. If you don't have one, you can use a regular muffin tin, but adjust the baking time accordingly.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Moisture:</strong> Gluten-free flours can sometimes be drier than traditional flour. Adding ingredients like mashed bananas, applesauce, or yogurt can help keep the pancake bites moist.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Don't be afraid to get creative with your add-ins. Try different fruits, nuts, spices, or even savory ingredients like cheese and herbs.</li>
    </ul>
