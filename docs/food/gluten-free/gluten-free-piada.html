    <h1>Gluten-Free Piada: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the desire for healthier eating habits.

    <h2>What is Piada?</h2>

    <p>Piada, also known as piadina, is a traditional Italian flatbread that originated in the Emilia-Romagna region.

Piada is often filled with a variety of ingredients, such as cured meats, cheeses, vegetables, and spreads, making it a versatile and satisfying meal.</p>

    <p>However, for those who need or choose to avoid gluten, traditional piada is off the menu. This is where gluten-free piada comes in, offering a safe and delicious alternative that can be enjoyed by everyone.</p>
