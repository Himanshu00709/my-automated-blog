    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Shrimp and Grits</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Grits</h3>

    <p>Start by bringing 4 cups of gluten-free chicken or vegetable stock to a boil. Slowly whisk in 1 cup of gluten-free stone-ground grits. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 20-25 minutes or until the grits are creamy and tender. Stir in 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter and 1/2 cup of shredded gluten-free cheese (optional). Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Shrimp</h3>

    <p>While the grits are cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 4 slices of chopped gluten-free bacon and cook until crispy. Remove the bacon and set aside, leaving the rendered fat in the skillet. Add 1 pound of peeled and deveined shrimp to the skillet, seasoning with paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and black pepper. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side until the shrimp are pink and opaque. Remove the shrimp and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Sauce</h3>

    <p>In the same skillet, add 1 minced garlic clove and 1/2 cup of chopped green onions. Sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Pour in 1/2 cup of gluten-free chicken stock and 1/4 cup of heavy cream (or a dairy-free alternative). Simmer for 5 minutes, then return the shrimp and bacon to the skillet. Stir to combine and heat through.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve</h3>

    <p>Spoon the creamy grits into bowls and top with the shrimp mixture. Garnish with chopped parsley or green onions. Serve immediately and enjoy!</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Are grits naturally gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, grits are made from ground corn, which is naturally gluten-free. However, cross-contamination can occur during processing, so always choose grits labeled gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I use instant grits for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Instant grits are not recommended because they often contain additives or flavorings that may include gluten. Stick to stone-ground grits for the best results.</p>

        <h3>3. What can I use instead of bacon?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer a vegetarian option, you can omit the bacon or use a gluten-free meat substitute. Alternatively, add smoked paprika for a similar smoky flavor.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store the shrimp and grits separately in airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop, adding a splash of stock or cream to the grits to restore their creaminess.</p>
