    <h3>Roasting</h3>
    <p>Roasting Brussels sprouts brings out their natural sweetness and creates a crispy texture. To roast Brussels sprouts, preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

    <h3>Steaming</h3>
    <p>Steaming Brussels sprouts is a healthy cooking method that preserves their nutrients. Place the sprouts in a steamer basket over boiling water and cover. Steam for 5-7 minutes, or until they are tender but still bright green. Steamed Brussels sprouts can be served as a side dish or added to salads.</p>
