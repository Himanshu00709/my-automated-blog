<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Pizza Dough with Doves Farm Mix</h2>

<p>One of the standout features of Doves Farm’s gluten-free pizza dough mix is its simplicity. Even if you’re new to gluten-free baking, you’ll find the process straightforward and rewarding. Here’s a step-by-step guide to making your own gluten-free pizza dough:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> You’ll need the Doves Farm gluten-free pizza dough mix, water, and olive oil. Some recipes also recommend adding an egg for extra richness.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> Combine the dry mix with water and olive oil in a bowl. Stir until a dough forms. If the dough feels too sticky, you can add a little more flour.</li>
    <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Unlike traditional dough, gluten-free dough doesn’t require extensive kneading. Simply shape it into a ball and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Place the dough on a floured surface and roll it out to your desired thickness. For a crispier crust, roll it thinner; for a thicker, chewier crust, leave it a bit thicker.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Transfer the rolled-out dough to a baking tray or pizza stone. Add your favorite toppings, such as tomato sauce, cheese, and vegetables.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F) and bake the pizza for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the toppings are cooked through.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free pizza can be a bit different from traditional pizza, but with a few tips, you can achieve excellent results:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a Pizza Stone:</strong> A pizza stone helps distribute heat evenly, resulting in a crispier crust.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overload with Toppings:</strong> Gluten-free dough can be more delicate, so avoid adding too many heavy toppings.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free pizza dough is versatile. Try adding herbs or spices to the dough for extra flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the Dough Rest:</strong> Allowing the dough to rest before rolling it out can improve its texture and make it easier to handle.</li>
</ul>
