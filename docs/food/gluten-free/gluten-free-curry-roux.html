    <h1>Gluten-Free Curry Roux: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Curry is a beloved dish enjoyed by millions around the world. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, traditional curry roux can be a challenge.

Gluten-free versions use alternative flours such as rice flour, tapioca starch, or cornstarch to achieve the same thick, rich consistency without the gluten.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Gluten-Free Curry Roux</h2>

    <p>The ingredients in gluten-free curry roux can vary depending on the brand or recipe, but they generally include a combination of the following:</p>
