    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Pasties at Home</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free pasties at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Combine your chosen gluten-free flour with xanthan gum, salt, and cold butter. Gradually add cold water until the dough comes together. Chill the dough for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> While the dough chills, prepare your filling. Common options include diced beef, potatoes, onions, and carrots, seasoned with salt, pepper, and herbs. For a vegetarian version, consider using mushrooms, spinach, and cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Pasties:</strong> Roll out the chilled dough and cut it into circles. Place a portion of the filling on one half of each circle, leaving a border around the edges. Fold the dough over the filling and crimp the edges to seal.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Brush the pasties with an egg wash or milk substitute for a golden finish. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the filling is cooked through.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pasties</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I freeze gluten-free pasties?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free pasties freeze well. After baking, allow them to cool completely, then wrap them individually in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe container. They can be reheated in the oven for a quick and convenient meal.</p>

        <h3>2. Are gluten-free pasties suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can make vegan gluten-free pasties by using plant-based butter and a vegan egg wash (such as almond milk mixed with a bit of maple syrup). For the filling, opt for vegetables, legumes, or vegan cheese.</p>

        <h3>3. What’s the best gluten-free flour for pasties?</h3>
        <p>The best flour depends on your preference. A blend of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch often works well for a balanced texture. Experiment with different combinations to find your favorite.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I prevent the crust from becoming too crumbly?</h3>
        <p>Adding xanthan gum or another binding agent is crucial for preventing a crumbly crust. Also, ensure that your dough is well-chilled before rolling it out, as this helps maintain its structure.</p>
