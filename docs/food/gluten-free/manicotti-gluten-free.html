    <h1>Manicotti Gluten-Free: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>Manicotti, a classic Italian dish, is beloved for its rich, cheesy filling and comforting pasta shells. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional manicotti can be off-limits due to the wheat-based pasta. Fortunately, gluten-free manicotti offers a delicious and healthy alternative that doesn’t compromise on flavor or texture. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about making and enjoying gluten-free manicotti, from selecting the right ingredients to mastering the cooking process.</p>

    <h2>What is Manicotti?</h2>
    <p>Manicotti is a traditional Italian dish that consists of large pasta tubes stuffed with a creamy ricotta cheese mixture, often combined with spinach, herbs, and sometimes ground meat.

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. A gluten-free diet eliminates these risks and can also offer benefits such as improved digestion and increased energy levels for some people. Gluten-free manicotti allows those on a gluten-free diet to enjoy this classic dish without worry.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Manicotti</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free manicotti is similar to the traditional version, with a few adjustments to ensure the dish remains gluten-free. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pasta</h3>
    <p>Boil the gluten-free pasta tubes according to the package instructions. Be careful not to overcook them, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy. Once cooked, drain and set aside to cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, combine ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan, chopped spinach (if using), minced garlic, and your choice of herbs (such as basil or oregano). Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Stuff the Pasta</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or a piping bag, carefully fill each pasta tube with the ricotta mixture. Arrange the stuffed tubes in a baking dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Sauce</h3>
    <p>Pour your favorite gluten-free tomato sauce over the stuffed pasta tubes, ensuring they are well-covered. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the manicotti for 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Manicotti</h2>

        <li><strong>Choose the Right Pasta:</strong> Not all gluten-free pastas are created equal. Look for brands that hold their shape well during cooking.</li>
