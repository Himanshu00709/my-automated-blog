    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Noodles</h3>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Everything</h3>
    <p>Return the cooked protein to the skillet with the vegetables. Add the cooked noodles and pour in your gluten-free sauce. Toss everything together until well-coated and heated through. Serve immediately, garnished with sesame seeds or chopped green onions if desired.</p>
