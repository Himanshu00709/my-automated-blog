    <h1>Gluten-Free Pumpkin Empanadas: A Delicious Fall Treat</h1>
    <p>As the leaves change color and the air turns crisp, there's no better way to embrace the flavors of fall than with a batch of gluten-free pumpkin empanadas. These delightful pastries combine the warm, spiced flavors of pumpkin with a flaky, gluten-free crust, making them the perfect treat for anyone with dietary restrictions or simply looking for a healthier alternative. Whether you're hosting a fall gathering or just craving a cozy snack, these empanadas are sure to impress.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Pumpkin Empanadas?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals seeking to reduce inflammation or improve digestive health. Traditional empanadas are made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, by using gluten-free flours such as almond flour, rice flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose blend, you can create a crust that is just as flaky and delicious as the original.</p>
    <p>Pumpkin, on the other hand, is a fall staple that is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. It's rich in vitamins A and C, fiber, and antioxidants, making it a healthy addition to any recipe. When combined with warm spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger, pumpkin creates a filling that is both comforting and nutritious.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by making the gluten-free dough. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the cold water, a tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Pumpkin Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the pumpkin filling. In a medium bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. Mix until well combined. Taste and adjust the spices if needed. Set the filling aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Empanadas</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to about 1/8-inch thickness. Use a round cookie cutter or a glass to cut out circles of dough. Place a spoonful of the pumpkin filling in the center of each circle. Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, and press the edges together with a fork to seal. Repeat until all the dough and filling are used.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Empanadas</h3>
    <p>Place the assembled empanadas on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. In a small bowl, beat the egg (or egg substitute) and brush it over the tops of the empanadas. This will give them a golden, shiny finish. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Allow the empanadas to cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these empanadas vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make these empanadas vegan by using a plant-based butter and an egg substitute for the egg wash. Many gluten-free flours are naturally vegan, so just double-check the ingredients to ensure they meet your dietary needs.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free pumpkin empanadas?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! These empanadas freeze well. After assembling them, place them on a baking sheet and freeze until solid. Once frozen, transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container. When you're ready to bake, simply place them on a baking sheet and bake as directed, adding a few extra minutes to the baking time.</p>

        <h3>What can I serve with gluten-free pumpkin empanadas?</h3>
        <p>These empanadas are delicious on their own, but you can also serve them with a dollop of whipped cream, a drizzle of caramel sauce, or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra special treat. They also pair well with a cup of hot apple cider or coffee.</p>

With a flaky, gluten-free crust and a spiced pumpkin filling, these pastries are sure to become a seasonal favorite. Whether you're baking them for a special occasion or just to enjoy on a cozy afternoon, these empanadas are a testament to the fact that gluten-free baking can be just as delicious and satisfying as traditional baking.
