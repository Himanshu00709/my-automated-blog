    <h1>Gluten-Free Italian Wedding Soup: A Hearty and Healthy Delight</h1>

    <p>Italian Wedding Soup is a classic dish that has been cherished for generations. Traditionally, it features a rich broth, tender meatballs, leafy greens, and tiny pasta pearls. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the traditional recipe can be off-limits. Enter <strong>Gluten-Free Italian Wedding Soup</strong>—a delicious and nutritious alternative that retains all the flavors of the original while being safe for gluten-free diets. In this blog post, we’ll explore the history of this beloved soup, how to make it gluten-free, and why it’s a perfect addition to your meal rotation.</p>

    <h2>The History of Italian Wedding Soup</h2>

    <p>Contrary to its name, Italian Wedding Soup has nothing to do with weddings. The name is derived from the Italian phrase <em>"minestra maritata,"</em> which translates to "married soup." This refers to the harmonious marriage of flavors between the meat and greens in the dish. Originating in Southern Italy, this soup has been a staple in Italian households for centuries. It’s a comforting, nutrient-packed meal that’s perfect for any occasion, not just weddings.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems. Fortunately, with the rise of gluten-free alternatives, it’s easier than ever to enjoy traditional dishes without compromising on taste or health. Gluten-free Italian Wedding Soup is a perfect example of how you can adapt a classic recipe to meet dietary needs without sacrificing flavor.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Meatballs</h3>

    <p>In a large bowl, combine the ground chicken or turkey, gluten-free breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, egg, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined. Roll the mixture into small, bite-sized meatballs (about 1 inch in diameter). Set aside.</p>

    <h3>2. Cook the Meatballs</h3>

    <p>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the meatballs and cook until they are browned on all sides. This should take about 5-7 minutes. Remove the meatballs from the pot and set them aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Soup Base</h3>

    <p>In the same pot, add the chicken broth and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and add the gluten-free pasta. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions, usually about 8-10 minutes.</p>

    <h3>4. Add the Greens and Meatballs</h3>

    <p>Once the pasta is cooked, add the chopped spinach or escarole to the pot. Stir until the greens are wilted. Return the meatballs to the pot and let everything simmer together for an additional 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with additional Parmesan cheese if desired. Serve hot and enjoy your gluten-free Italian Wedding Soup!</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>This gluten-free version of Italian Wedding Soup is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. The lean protein from the meatballs, the vitamins from the greens, and the fiber from the gluten-free pasta make this a well-rounded meal. It’s also low in calories and high in flavor, making it a great option for those looking to maintain a healthy diet.</p>
