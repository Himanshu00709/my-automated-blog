    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Potatoes:</strong> Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Peel and dice the potatoes into bite-sized pieces. Toss them with a little oil, salt, and pepper, then spread them out on a baking sheet. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until they’re golden and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Cheese Sauce:</strong> While the potatoes are baking, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the gluten-free flour and whisk until it forms a smooth paste. Gradually pour in the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Cook until the sauce thickens, then stir in the shredded cheddar cheese until it’s fully melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine and Serve:</strong> Once the potatoes are done, transfer them to a serving dish. Pour the cheese sauce over the top, then garnish with chopped green onions and sliced jalapeños if desired. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
