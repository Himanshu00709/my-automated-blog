<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Spicy Tuna Rolls</h2>

<p>Creating gluten-free spicy tuna rolls at home is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to make a restaurant-quality roll in the comfort of your own kitchen.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Sushi Rice</h3>

<p>Start by rinsing 2 cups of sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Cook the rice according to the package instructions. Once cooked, transfer the rice to a large bowl and gently fold in a mixture of 1/4 cup rice vinegar, 2 tablespoons sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature before using.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Spicy Tuna Filling</h3>

<p>In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup of finely chopped fresh tuna with 2 tablespoons of gluten-free mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon of gluten-free soy sauce (or tamari), and 1 teaspoon of sriracha sauce. Adjust the sriracha to your preferred level of spiciness. Mix well and set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble the Roll</h3>

<p>Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat. Spread a thin layer of sushi rice evenly over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top. Sprinkle sesame seeds over the rice if desired. Flip the nori sheet over so the rice is facing down. Spread a line of the spicy tuna mixture along the center of the nori. Using the bamboo mat, roll the sushi tightly from the bottom, pressing gently to shape the roll. Seal the edge with a bit of water.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Slice and Serve</h3>

<p>Using a sharp knife, slice the roll into 6-8 pieces. Serve with gluten-free soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi. Enjoy your homemade gluten-free spicy tuna rolls!</p>
