    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Batter:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk, melted butter, vanilla extract, and sugar. Mix well. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Aebleskiver Pan:</strong> Place your aebleskiver pan over medium heat and lightly grease each mold with butter or oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Aebleskiver:</strong> Fill each mold about 3/4 full with the batter. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the edges start to set and bubbles form on the surface. Using a skewer or fork, gently flip each aebleskiver to cook the other side. Continue cooking until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove the aebleskiver from the pan and serve warm with your favorite toppings, such as powdered sugar, jam, or syrup.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Aebleskiver</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free aebleskiver can be a bit tricky, especially if you're new to gluten-free baking. Here are some tips to ensure your aebleskiver turn out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Good Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right balance of flours and starches to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense, tough aebleskiver. Mix the batter until just combined, and don’t worry if there are a few lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Control the Heat:</strong> Aebleskiver cook best over medium heat. If the heat is too high, the outside will burn before the inside is cooked. If it’s too low, the aebleskiver may not rise properly.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Fillings:</strong> While traditional aebleskiver are often filled with jam or chocolate, feel free to get creative. Try filling them with fruit, cheese, or even savory ingredients like herbs and spices.</li>
    </ul>
