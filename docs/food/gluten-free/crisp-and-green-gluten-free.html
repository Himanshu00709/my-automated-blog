With a focus on fresh, wholesome ingredients and a commitment to catering to dietary restrictions, Crisp and Green has become a go-to destination for anyone seeking a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Crisp and Green Stand Out?</h2>

    <p>Crisp and Green is not just another salad joint. It’s a culinary experience that prioritizes health, flavor, and inclusivity. The restaurant offers a wide array of gluten-free options, from hearty salads to nourishing grain bowls, all made with the freshest ingredients. What sets Crisp and Green apart is its dedication to transparency.

    <h2>The Science Behind Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

    <p>For those unfamiliar, gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. While harmless for most people, it can cause severe health issues for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine, resulting in symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and malnutrition. A gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment for this condition.</p>

    <p>Even for those without celiac disease, many people report feeling better on a gluten-free diet, citing improved digestion, increased energy levels, and reduced inflammation. However, it’s important to note that a gluten-free diet is not inherently healthier unless it’s balanced with nutrient-dense foods. This is where Crisp and Green shines, offering meals that are not only gluten-free but also packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.</p>
