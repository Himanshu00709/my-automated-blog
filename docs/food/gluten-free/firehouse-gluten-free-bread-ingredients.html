<h2>Why These Ingredients Matter</h2>

<p>Each ingredient in Firehouse Gluten-Free Bread serves a specific purpose, contributing to the bread’s texture, flavor, and nutritional profile. For example, brown rice flour is a whole grain that provides a hearty base, while tapioca and potato starches work together to mimic the elasticity and softness typically provided by gluten. Psyllium husk is a game-changer in gluten-free baking, as it helps bind the ingredients together and adds a significant amount of dietary fiber, which is often lacking in gluten-free diets.</p>

<p>Flaxseed meal not only enhances the texture but also introduces omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for heart health. Apple cider vinegar, a natural leavening agent, helps the bread rise without the need for artificial additives. Finally, sea salt enhances the flavor without overpowering the other ingredients. Together, these components create a bread that is both satisfying and nutritious.</p>
