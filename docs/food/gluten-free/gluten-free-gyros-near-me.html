    <h1>Gluten-Free Gyros Near Me: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding delicious and safe dining options can sometimes feel like a treasure hunt. One dish that often comes up in conversations about gluten-free dining is the gyro. Traditionally, gyros are made with pita bread, which contains gluten. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets, many restaurants and food establishments have started offering gluten-free alternatives. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about finding gluten-free gyros near you, including what to look for, where to find them, and how to ensure they’re truly gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gyros?</h2>

    <p>Gyros are a popular Greek dish that typically consists of meat (usually lamb, beef, or chicken) cooked on a vertical rotisserie, sliced thinly, and served in a pita wrap with toppings like tomatoes, onions, and tzatziki sauce. The dish is known for its rich flavors and satisfying texture. However, the traditional pita bread used in gyros contains gluten, which can be problematic for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe digestive issues, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term health complications. Even for those without celiac disease, gluten sensitivity can cause symptoms like bloating, fatigue, and joint pain. As a result, many people choose to adopt a gluten-free diet to improve their health and well-being.</p>

        <li><strong>Call Ahead:</strong> If you’re unsure whether a restaurant offers gluten-free gyros, call ahead and ask. This can save you time and ensure you’re not disappointed when you arrive.</li>
        <li><strong>Look for Gluten-Free Certifications:</strong> Some restaurants may have gluten-free certifications or labels on their menus, indicating that they take gluten-free dining seriously.</li>
