    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making a Gluten-Free Chicken Caesar Wrap</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your own gluten-free chicken Caesar wrap:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> Start by gathering all your ingredients. Ensure that the grilled chicken is sliced into thin strips, the romaine lettuce is washed and chopped, and the Parmesan cheese is grated.</li>
        <li><strong>Warm the Tortilla:</strong> Heat the gluten-free tortilla in a skillet or microwave for a few seconds to make it more pliable. This will prevent it from cracking when you roll it.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Wrap:</strong> Lay the tortilla flat on a clean surface. Spread the Caesar dressing evenly over the tortilla, leaving a small border around the edges. Layer the romaine lettuce, grilled chicken, Parmesan cheese, and croutons (if using) in the center of the tortilla.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll the Wrap:</strong> Fold the sides of the tortilla over the filling, then roll it up tightly from the bottom to the top, ensuring that the filling is securely enclosed.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Slice the wrap in half diagonally and serve immediately. For added convenience, you can wrap it in parchment paper or foil for easy handling.</li>
