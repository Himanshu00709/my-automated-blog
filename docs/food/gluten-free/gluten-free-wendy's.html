    <h1>Gluten-Free Options at Wendy's: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, fast-food chains like Wendy's have made strides in offering gluten-free options that cater to those with dietary restrictions. In this article, we'll explore the gluten-free menu items available at Wendy's, discuss cross-contamination risks, and provide tips for safely enjoying your meal.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even small amounts of gluten can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. For those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, the symptoms may be less severe but still uncomfortable. Therefore, it's crucial to identify safe food options when dining out.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Menu Items at Wendy's</h2>
    <p>Wendy's offers a variety of menu items that are naturally gluten-free or can be modified to be gluten-free. Below is a table summarizing some of the most popular gluten-free options:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Menu Item</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>
    <p>While Wendy's offers several gluten-free options, it's important to be aware of the risk of cross-contamination. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods or surfaces. For example, a grill used to cook buns may also be used to cook gluten-free items like grilled chicken. To minimize this risk, consider the following tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask the staff to change gloves before preparing your order.</li>
        <li>Request that your food be prepared on a clean surface or in a separate area.</li>
        <li>Be cautious with fried items, as they may be cooked in the same oil as gluten-containing foods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for Ordering Gluten-Free at Wendy's</h2>
