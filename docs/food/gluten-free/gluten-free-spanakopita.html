    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Spanakopita</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free spanakopita is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a delicious and healthy version of this classic dish:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Filling</h3>

    <p>Start by washing and chopping the fresh spinach. If you’re using frozen spinach, make sure to thaw and drain it thoroughly. In a large bowl, combine the spinach, crumbled feta cheese, finely chopped onion, beaten eggs, and fresh dill. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Mix everything well until the ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Assemble the Spanakopita</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Take your gluten-free phyllo dough and carefully unroll it. Brush each sheet lightly with olive oil to prevent it from drying out. Layer several sheets of phyllo dough in a baking dish, brushing each layer with olive oil. Spread the spinach and feta mixture evenly over the phyllo dough. Top with another layer of phyllo dough, brushing each sheet with olive oil as you go. Make sure to seal the edges to prevent the filling from leaking out during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake to Perfection</h3>

    <p>Place the assembled spanakopita in the preheated oven and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and crispy. Once baked, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Spanakopita</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free spanakopita is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Spinach is rich in vitamins A, C, and K, as well as iron and calcium. Feta cheese provides a good source of protein and calcium, while olive oil adds healthy fats.
