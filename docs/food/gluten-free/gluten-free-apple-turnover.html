<h1>Gluten-Free Apple Turnover: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

<p>Apple turnovers are a classic pastry that many of us have enjoyed since childhood. The combination of flaky pastry and sweet, spiced apple filling is simply irresistible.

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
<p>Start by combining the gluten-free flour blend and xanthan gum in a large mixing bowl. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the cold water, mixing until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Apple Filling</h3>
<p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the apple filling. In a medium saucepan, combine the diced apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the apples are tender and the mixture has thickened. Remove from heat and let it cool.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble the Turnovers</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Cut the dough into squares or rectangles, depending on your preference. Spoon a generous amount of the apple filling onto one half of each dough piece, leaving a small border around the edges. Fold the dough over the filling to create a triangle or rectangle shape, and press the edges with a fork to seal.</p>

<h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Place the assembled turnovers on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Beat the egg and brush it over the tops of the turnovers for a golden finish. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crisp. Allow the turnovers to cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Apple Turnovers</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking pastries.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep the butter cold:</strong> Cold butter is key to achieving a flaky pastry. If the butter melts before baking, the dough will lose its flakiness.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t overfill the turnovers:</strong> While it’s tempting to add more filling, overfilling can cause the turnovers to burst open during baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Feel free to add other spices like cardamom or cloves to the filling for a unique twist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Apple Turnovers</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit for the filling?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! While apples are the classic choice, you can use other fruits like pears, peaches, or berries. Just adjust the sugar and spices accordingly.</p>

    <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough up to 2 days in advance. Just keep it wrapped in plastic wrap and stored in the refrigerator until you’re ready to use it.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftover turnovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover turnovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 3 months. Reheat in the oven before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these turnovers vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make vegan gluten-free apple turnovers by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using a flax egg instead of a regular egg for the egg wash.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free apple turnovers are a delightful treat that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions.
