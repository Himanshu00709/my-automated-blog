    <h1>Gluten-Free Options at Five Guys: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

However, Five Guys has made strides in offering gluten-free options that cater to those with dietary restrictions. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free menu at Five Guys, discuss cross-contamination risks, and provide tips for a safe and enjoyable dining experience.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial for those with gluten-related disorders to carefully select their food options, especially when dining out.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Options at Five Guys</h2>
    <p>Five Guys offers a variety of gluten-free options, making it a relatively safe choice for those avoiding gluten. Here’s a breakdown of what you can enjoy:</p>

    <h3>Burgers</h3>
    <p>Five Guys burgers are naturally gluten-free when ordered without the bun. The patties are made from 100% pure beef with no fillers or additives, and you can customize your toppings to suit your preferences. Here’s a list of gluten-free toppings:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Topping</th>
            <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>

    <h3>Fries</h3>
    <p>Five Guys fries are another gluten-free option. They are cooked in 100% peanut oil, which is naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that the fries are cooked in the same oil as other items that may contain gluten, so there is a risk of cross-contamination. If you have severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, you may want to exercise caution.</p>

    <h3>Milkshakes</h3>
    <p>Five Guys milkshakes are also gluten-free, as they are made with gluten-free ingredients. You can choose from a variety of flavors, including chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. However, be sure to avoid any mix-ins that may contain gluten, such as cookies or brownies.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>
    <p>While Five Guys offers several gluten-free options, cross-contamination is a potential concern. The kitchen environment is shared, and gluten-containing items like buns and toppings are prepared in the same area. Here are some tips to minimize the risk:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Communicate with Staff:</strong> Inform the staff about your gluten intolerance or celiac disease. They can take extra precautions when preparing your meal.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt for a Lettuce Wrap:</strong> Instead of a bun, ask for your burger to be wrapped in lettuce to avoid any contact with gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Allergen Information:</strong> Five Guys provides allergen information on their website and in-store. Review this information to make informed choices.</li>
    </ul>
