    <h1>5 Guys Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, popular fast-food chains like Five Guys have made strides in accommodating gluten-free diets. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about Five Guys’ gluten-free options, from their burgers to their fries, and provide tips for safely enjoying a meal at this beloved burger joint.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining at Five Guys</h2>

    <p>Five Guys is renowned for its customizable burgers and fresh ingredients. While they don’t offer gluten-free buns, their menu is still accessible to those avoiding gluten. The key is knowing what to order and how to communicate your dietary needs to the staff. Here’s a breakdown of what you can enjoy:</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Menu Options</h3>

    <p>Five Guys’ menu is relatively simple, which makes it easier to identify gluten-free options. Here’s a list of items that are generally considered safe for a gluten-free diet:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Item</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Burgers (without bun)</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Hot Dogs (without bun)</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Fries</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Toppings (lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, etc.)</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cheese</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Bacon</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Cross-Contamination Concerns</h3>

    <p>While Five Guys offers gluten-free options, cross-contamination is a potential risk. The restaurant uses shared cooking surfaces and utensils, which means there’s a chance that gluten-free items could come into contact with gluten-containing ingredients. If you have celiac disease or a severe gluten allergy, it’s essential to communicate your needs clearly to the staff and consider the risks before dining.</p>

    <h2>Tips for a Safe Gluten-Free Experience at Five Guys</h2>

    <p>To minimize the risk of cross-contamination and ensure a safe dining experience, follow these tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Order a Lettuce Wrap:</strong> Instead of a bun, ask for your burger or hot dog to be wrapped in lettuce. This is a popular gluten-free alternative that many Five Guys locations offer.</li>
        <li><strong>Specify Your Needs:</strong> Clearly inform the staff that you have a gluten allergy or celiac disease. They may take extra precautions when preparing your meal.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Certain Toppings:</strong> Some toppings, like malt vinegar, contain gluten. Stick to safe options like mustard, ketchup, and mayonnaise.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the Fryer:</strong> Five Guys fries are cooked in a dedicated fryer, which reduces the risk of cross-contamination. However, it’s always a good idea to confirm this with the staff.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Five Guys Fries: A Gluten-Free Delight</h2>

    <p>One of the standout gluten-free options at Five Guys is their fries. Made from fresh potatoes and cooked in 100% peanut oil, Five Guys fries are a favorite among gluten-free diners. Here’s why they’re a safe and delicious choice:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Aspect</th>
                <th>Details</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Ingredients</td>
                <td>Fresh potatoes, peanut oil, and salt</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cooking Process</td>
                <td>Dedicated fryer with no shared cooking surfaces</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Flavor</td>
                <td>Crispy, golden, and perfectly seasoned</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Five Guys’ commitment to using fresh ingredients and dedicated fryers makes their fries a reliable gluten-free option. However, always double-check with the staff to ensure that no changes have been made to their cooking process.</p>
