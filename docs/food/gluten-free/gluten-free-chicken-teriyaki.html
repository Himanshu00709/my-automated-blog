    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Start by cutting the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Heat a tablespoon of sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Teriyaki Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, whisk together the gluten-free soy sauce, honey (or maple syrup), rice vinegar, minced ginger, and garlic. In a separate bowl, mix the cornstarch with water to create a slurry. Add the slurry to the sauce mixture and whisk until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine and Simmer</h3>
    <p>Pour the teriyaki sauce into the skillet and bring to a simmer. Add the cooked chicken back into the skillet, stirring to coat the pieces evenly. Allow the sauce to thicken and the chicken to cook through, about 5-7 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Garnish</h3>
    <p>Once the chicken is fully cooked and the sauce has thickened, remove the skillet from the heat. Serve the gluten-free chicken teriyaki over steamed rice or quinoa. Garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions if desired.</p>

The use of gluten-free soy sauce ensures that the dish is safe for those with gluten sensitivities, while the addition of ginger and garlic provides anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties. The dish is also relatively low in calories, making it a great option for those looking to maintain a healthy diet.</p>
