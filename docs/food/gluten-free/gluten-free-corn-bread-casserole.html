    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free corn bread casserole is straightforward and requires just a few simple steps. Follow these instructions to create a dish that's both delicious and gluten-free:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9x9 inch baking dish with butter or a non-stick cooking spray.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free cornmeal, gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Stir until well mixed.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, melted butter, and honey (or sugar). Mix until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense casserole.</li>
        <li><strong>Add optional ingredients:</strong> If you're using any add-ins like cheese, jalapeños, or corn kernels, fold them into the batter at this stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Allow the casserole to cool for a few minutes before serving. It pairs wonderfully with soups, stews, or a simple green salad.</li>
    </ol>
