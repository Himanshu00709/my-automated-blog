    <h1>Gluten-Free Ziti: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>In recent years, gluten-free diets have gained immense popularity, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also among health-conscious individuals looking to improve their overall well-being. One dish that has successfully made the transition to the gluten-free world is ziti. Traditionally made with wheat-based pasta, ziti is a beloved Italian dish known for its tubular pasta and rich, savory sauces. But what happens when you remove the gluten? The answer is a delightful, healthier version of the classic dish that doesn’t compromise on taste or texture. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free ziti, from its nutritional benefits to how you can make it at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Ziti?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free ziti can be prepared in the same way as traditional ziti, with a variety of sauces and toppings. Whether you prefer a classic marinara sauce, a creamy Alfredo, or a hearty meat sauce, gluten-free ziti can be customized to suit your taste preferences. The key is to choose high-quality gluten-free pasta that holds up well during cooking and doesn’t become mushy or fall apart.</p>
