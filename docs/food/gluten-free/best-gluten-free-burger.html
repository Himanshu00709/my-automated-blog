    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Are all burgers gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>No, not all burgers are gluten-free. Traditional burgers are served on buns made from wheat, which contains gluten.

        <h3>3. What are some gluten-free alternatives to traditional burger buns?</h3>
        <p>There are several gluten-free alternatives to traditional burger buns, including lettuce wraps, portobello mushroom caps, and gluten-free bread made from almond flour, coconut flour, or gluten-free grains like quinoa or rice.</p>

        <h3>4. Are gluten-free burgers healthier?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free burgers can be healthier, especially if you choose high-quality, whole-food ingredients. However, it's important to note that "gluten-free" doesn't automatically mean healthy. Some gluten-free products may still be high in calories, sugar, or unhealthy fats. Always read labels and choose wisely.</p>
