<h1>Gluten-Free Latkes in NYC: A Culinary Guide</h1>

<p>New York City, a melting pot of cultures and cuisines, offers a diverse array of culinary delights. Among these, latkes—a traditional Jewish dish made from grated potatoes and onions, fried to golden perfection—hold a special place, especially during Hanukkah. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this crispy treat can be a challenge. Fortunately, NYC is home to several eateries that serve gluten-free latkes, ensuring everyone can partake in this delicious tradition. In this guide, we’ll explore the best spots for gluten-free latkes in NYC, along with tips for making your own at home.</p>

<h2>Why Gluten-Free Latkes?</h2>

<p>Latkes are traditionally made with potatoes, onions, eggs, and a binding agent like flour or matzo meal. For those who need to avoid gluten, the use of wheat-based flour or matzo meal can be problematic. Gluten-free latkes substitute these ingredients with gluten-free alternatives such as almond flour, chickpea flour, or even gluten-free breadcrumbs. This ensures that the latkes remain crispy and delicious without compromising dietary needs.</p>
