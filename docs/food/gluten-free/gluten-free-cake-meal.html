        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Measure Accurately: Gluten-free flours can behave differently than traditional flours, so it’s important to measure your ingredients carefully. Use a kitchen scale for the most accurate results.</td>

            <td>2</td>
            <td>Combine with Other Flours: Some gluten-free cake meals are blends, while others are single-ingredient flours. If you’re using a single-ingredient flour, consider combining it with other gluten-free flours to achieve the desired texture.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>Add Binders: Gluten-free flours lack the binding properties of gluten, so you may need to add binders such as xanthan gum or psyllium husk to help your baked goods hold together.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>Adjust Liquid Content: Gluten-free flours often absorb more liquid than traditional flours, so you may need to adjust the amount of liquid in your recipe. Start with a little less liquid and add more as needed.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>Mix Thoroughly: Gluten-free batters can be thicker than traditional batters, so be sure to mix thoroughly to ensure even distribution of ingredients.</td>
