    <h2>The History of Country Fried Steak</h2>

    <p>Country fried steak, also known as chicken fried steak, has its roots in Southern cuisine.

Over time, the dish evolved to include a Southern twist, with the addition of a creamy gravy made from pan drippings. Today, country fried steak is a staple in diners and home kitchens across the country, loved for its crispy exterior and tender, juicy interior.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of health issues, including digestive problems, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. Additionally, some people choose to go gluten-free as part of a healthier lifestyle, as it can help reduce inflammation and improve digestion. Whatever your reason for avoiding gluten, it’s important to find delicious and satisfying alternatives to your favorite foods, like country fried steak.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Breading Station:</strong> In one shallow dish, place the gluten-free flour. In another dish, whisk together the eggs and milk. In a third dish, place the gluten-free breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the Steak:</strong> Season both sides of the cube steak with salt and pepper.</li>

        <li><strong>Fry the Steak:</strong> Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the breaded steak and fry for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove the steak from the skillet and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. Serve hot with your favorite gluten-free gravy and sides.</li>
