<h1>Gluten-Free Sandwich Ideas: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the general desire for healthier eating habits. Sandwiches, a staple in many diets, can be a challenge for those avoiding gluten.

Additionally, some people choose a gluten-free diet for its potential health benefits, such as improved digestion and increased energy levels.</p>
