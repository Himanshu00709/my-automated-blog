    <h1>Gluten-Free Clam Chowder: A Boston Classic Reimagined</h1>
    <p>When you think of Boston, one of the first culinary delights that comes to mind is clam chowder. This creamy, hearty soup has been a staple of New England cuisine for centuries. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic dish can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free clam chowder—a delicious reimagining of the traditional recipe that ensures everyone can savor the flavors of Boston without compromise.</p>

    <h2>The History of Clam Chowder in Boston</h2>
    <p>Clam chowder has deep roots in New England, particularly in Boston. The dish dates back to the early 18th century, when settlers combined local clams with potatoes, onions, and salt pork to create a nourishing meal. Over time, the recipe evolved, and cream became a key ingredient, giving the chowder its signature richness. Today, Boston-style clam chowder is known for its thick, creamy texture and robust flavor.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>For many, gluten-free eating is not a choice but a necessity. Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, affects approximately 1% of the population. Additionally, many people experience non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which can cause digestive discomfort and other symptoms. Traditional clam chowder often contains flour as a thickening agent, making it off-limits for those avoiding gluten. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can enjoy a gluten-free version that is just as satisfying.</p>
