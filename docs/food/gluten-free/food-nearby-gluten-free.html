Therefore, avoiding gluten is not just a dietary choice but a necessity for many.</p>

    <h3>2. Check Restaurant Websites</h3>
    <p>Many restaurants now list their gluten-free options online. Before heading out, take a moment to browse the restaurant's website or call ahead to inquire about their gluten-free offerings. Some establishments even have dedicated gluten-free menus, making it easier for you to make informed choices.</p>
