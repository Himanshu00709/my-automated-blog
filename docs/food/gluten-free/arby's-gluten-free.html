    <h1>Arby's Gluten-Free Options: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, Arby's, the popular fast-food chain known for its roast beef sandwiches, has made strides in offering gluten-free options. In this article, we’ll explore Arby's gluten-free menu, discuss cross-contamination risks, and provide tips for safely enjoying your meal.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial for these individuals to carefully select their food options, especially when dining out.</p>

    <h2>Arby's Gluten-Free Menu Options</h2>
    <p>While Arby's is not a gluten-free restaurant, they do offer several menu items that are naturally free of gluten. Below is a table outlining some of the gluten-free options available at Arby's:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Menu Item</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Roast Beef</td>
                <td>Arby's classic roast beef is naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to order it without the bun to avoid gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Turkey Breast</td>
                <td>Another gluten-free option, the turkey breast can be enjoyed without the bun or in a salad.</td>
            </tr>

                <td>While Arby's curly fries are made from potatoes, they are cooked in shared fryers, which may pose a cross-contamination risk.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Apple Slices</td>
                <td>A safe and healthy gluten-free snack option available at Arby's.</td>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks at Arby's</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest concerns for individuals with gluten sensitivities is cross-contamination. Even if a menu item is naturally gluten-free, it can become contaminated if it comes into contact with gluten-containing ingredients during preparation. At Arby's, cross-contamination is a real risk, especially in the fryers where gluten-containing items like mozzarella sticks and chicken tenders are cooked.</p>
    <p>To minimize the risk of cross-contamination, consider the following tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inform the staff about your gluten sensitivity or celiac disease when placing your order.</li>
        <li>Ask for your food to be prepared separately, using clean utensils and surfaces.</li>
        <li>Avoid fried items, as they are often cooked in shared fryers.</li>
    </ul>
