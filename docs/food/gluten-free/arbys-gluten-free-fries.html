    <h1>Arby's Gluten-Free Fries: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding safe and delicious fast food options can be a challenge. Arby's, known for its roast beef sandwiches and curly fries, has become a popular destination for many. But are Arby's fries gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the details of Arby's gluten-free fries, including their ingredients, preparation process, and how they fit into a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Are Arby's Fries Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, Arby's fries are gluten-free! According to Arby's official allergen information, their classic fries and curly fries do not contain gluten ingredients. However, it’s important to note that cross-contamination can occur in the kitchen, especially in a fast-food environment where gluten-containing items are prepared alongside gluten-free options.</p>

    <p>Arby's fries are made from potatoes, vegetable oil, and a blend of seasonings. The seasoning used on their curly fries is also gluten-free, which is a relief for those who love the extra flavor. However, always double-check with the staff at your local Arby's to ensure that their preparation process hasn’t changed and that they are taking the necessary precautions to avoid cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Arby's Gluten-Free Fries</h2>

    <p>Understanding the ingredients in your food is crucial, especially when managing a gluten-free diet. Here’s a breakdown of the ingredients in Arby's classic fries:</p>

            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Potatoes</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
