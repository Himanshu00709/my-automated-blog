Moreover, these pies are often lower in carbohydrates and higher in protein, making them a healthier option for those looking to maintain a balanced diet.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making a Gluten-Free Beef Pie</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free beef pie may seem daunting, but with the right steps, it’s a straightforward process. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create a delicious pie:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Pastry</h3>
    <p>Start by mixing your gluten-free flour blend with xanthan gum, salt, and cold butter. Use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour until it resembles breadcrumbs. Gradually add cold water until the dough comes together. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Cook the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the filling. Brown the beef in a large pan, then add chopped onions, carrots, and peas. Stir in beef stock, herbs, and spices, and let the mixture simmer until the vegetables are tender and the sauce has thickened.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Roll out the chilled dough on a floured surface and line your pie dish with it. Add the beef filling, then cover with another layer of rolled-out dough. Seal the edges and cut a few slits in the top to allow steam to escape.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and bake the pie for 30-40 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Let it cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Beef Pie</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free beef pies are not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. The use of alternative flours can increase the fiber content, while grass-fed beef provides high-quality protein and essential nutrients like iron and B vitamins. Additionally, the inclusion of vegetables adds vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, making this dish a well-rounded meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Beef Pie</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use any gluten-free flour for the pastry?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a variety of gluten-free flours such as almond, rice, or coconut flour. However, it’s best to use a blend specifically designed for baking to achieve the right texture.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I store leftover gluten-free beef pie?</h3>
        <p>Leftover pie can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I freeze a gluten-free beef pie?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the pie either before or after baking. If freezing before baking, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and foil. If freezing after baking, let it cool completely before wrapping and freezing.</p>

        <h3>4. Is gluten-free beef pie suitable for vegetarians?</h3>
        <p>No, this recipe contains beef, but you can easily adapt it by using a plant-based protein like lentils or mushrooms for a vegetarian version.</p>
