    <h1>Gluten-Free Cheesesteak: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>For those who love the classic cheesesteak but need to avoid gluten, the gluten-free cheesesteak is a game-changer. This mouthwatering dish retains all the flavors of the traditional cheesesteak while being safe for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.

    <h2>How to Make a Gluten-Free Cheesesteak</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free cheesesteak is straightforward and can be done in just a few steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> Thinly slice the beef and onions. If you’re using bell peppers, slice them as well. Grate or slice the cheese if it’s not already prepared.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Beef:</strong> Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add a tablespoon of olive oil or butter. Add the sliced beef and cook until it’s browned and cooked through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Vegetables:</strong> In the same skillet, add the onions (and bell peppers if using) and cook until they are soft and caramelized.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the Beef and Vegetables:</strong> Mix the cooked beef with the sautéed vegetables in the skillet. Add the cheese on top and let it melt.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast the Gluten-Free Hoagie Rolls:</strong> While the cheese is melting, toast the gluten-free hoagie rolls in the oven or on a skillet to give them a crispy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Cheesesteak:</strong> Spoon the beef, vegetable, and cheese mixture onto the toasted gluten-free hoagie rolls. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Cheesesteak</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free cheesesteak turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Bread:</strong> The key to a great gluten-free cheesesteak is the bread. Look for high-quality gluten-free hoagie rolls that are sturdy enough to hold the filling without falling apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Slice the Beef Thinly:</strong> Thinly sliced beef cooks quickly and evenly, ensuring that every bite is tender and flavorful.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook the Vegetables:</strong> Sauté the onions and bell peppers until they are just soft and caramelized. Overcooking can make them mushy and less flavorful.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh beef, vegetables, and cheese will always yield the best results. Avoid pre-packaged or processed ingredients that may contain hidden gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Cheese:</strong> While provolone and American cheese are traditional choices, feel free to experiment with other gluten-free cheeses like cheddar, mozzarella, or even a dairy-free alternative if you’re lactose intolerant.</li>
    </ul>
