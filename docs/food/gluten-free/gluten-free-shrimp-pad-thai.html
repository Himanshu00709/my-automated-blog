<h1>Gluten-Free Shrimp Pad Thai: A Flavorful and Healthy Delight</h1>

<p>Pad Thai is one of Thailand's most iconic dishes, known for its perfect balance of sweet, sour, salty, and umami flavors. Traditionally, this dish is made with rice noodles, which are naturally gluten-free, making it an excellent choice for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. However, some Pad Thai recipes and sauces may contain hidden gluten, which can be problematic for those on a strict gluten-free diet. In this article, we’ll explore how to make a delicious and safe gluten-free shrimp Pad Thai that’s both flavorful and healthy.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Shrimp Pad Thai?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Even for those without these conditions, reducing gluten intake can lead to improved digestion and overall health. Shrimp Pad Thai is an excellent gluten-free option because it relies on rice noodles, which are naturally free of gluten. Additionally, shrimp is a lean source of protein, making this dish both nutritious and satisfying.</p>

<p>However, it’s crucial to ensure that all ingredients, especially the sauce, are gluten-free. Many store-bought Pad Thai sauces contain soy sauce or other additives that may include gluten. By making your own sauce at home, you can control the ingredients and ensure that your dish is 100% gluten-free.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Rice Noodles</h3>
<p>Start by cooking the rice noodles according to the package instructions. Typically, you’ll soak them in hot water for about 8-10 minutes until they are soft but still slightly firm. Drain and set aside.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Gluten-Free Sauce</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, combine the gluten-free tamari or coconut aminos, fish sauce, lime juice, and brown sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. This sauce will provide the signature sweet, sour, and salty flavors of Pad Thai.</p>

<h3>3. Cook the Shrimp</h3>
<p>Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side until they turn pink and opaque. Remove the shrimp from the skillet and set aside.</p>

<h3>4. Sauté the Garlic and Eggs</h3>
<p>In the same skillet, add the remaining oil and sauté the minced garlic for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Push the garlic to one side of the skillet and crack the eggs into the other side. Scramble the eggs until they are fully cooked.</p>

<h3>5. Combine Everything</h3>
<p>Add the cooked rice noodles, shrimp, and prepared sauce to the skillet. Toss everything together until well combined and heated through. Add the bean sprouts and green onions, and toss again.</p>

<h3>6. Garnish and Serve</h3>
<p>Transfer the Pad Thai to serving plates and garnish with crushed peanuts, fresh cilantro, and a sprinkle of red chili flakes if desired. Serve immediately with lime wedges on the side.</p>
