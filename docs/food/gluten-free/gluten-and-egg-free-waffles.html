    <h2>FAQs About Gluten and Egg-Free Waffles</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I make gluten and egg-free waffles ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make gluten and egg-free waffles ahead of time. Simply cook the waffles as directed, let them cool completely, and store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them for up to 2 months. To reheat, pop them in the toaster or oven until warm and crispy.</p>

        <h3>2. What are the best toppings for gluten and egg-free waffles?</h3>
        <p>The best toppings for gluten and egg-free waffles are those that complement their flavor and texture. Fresh fruit, such as berries, bananas, or sliced peaches, adds natural sweetness and a burst of color. Maple syrup, honey, or agave nectar are classic choices for added sweetness. For a richer option, try dairy-free whipped cream or a dollop of nut butter.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I use a different type of flour in this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While a gluten-free flour blend works well in this recipe, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, oat flour, or rice flour. Keep in mind that different flours may alter the texture and flavor of the waffles, so you may need to adjust the liquid or leavening agents accordingly.</p>

        <h3>4. Are gluten and egg-free waffles healthy?</h3>
        <p>Gluten and egg-free waffles can be a healthy option, especially when made with whole, nutrient-dense ingredients. Using gluten-free flours like almond or oat flour adds fiber and protein, while non-dairy milk provides essential vitamins and minerals. Additionally, avoiding eggs and gluten can make these waffles easier to digest for some people. However, like any food, moderation is key, and it's important to balance your diet with a variety of nutrient-rich foods.</p>
