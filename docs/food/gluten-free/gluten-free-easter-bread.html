    <h1>Gluten-Free Easter Bread: A Delicious Tradition for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Easter is a time of celebration, family gatherings, and, of course, delicious food. One of the most cherished traditions during this holiday is baking and sharing Easter bread. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying this festive treat can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free Easter bread—a delightful alternative that allows everyone to partake in the joy of this seasonal delicacy. In this blog post, we’ll explore the history of Easter bread, the benefits of going gluten-free, and provide a step-by-step guide to making your own gluten-free Easter bread at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Easter Bread</h2>
    <p>Easter bread, also known as "Paska" or "Tsoureki," has a rich history that dates back centuries. Originating in Eastern Europe, this sweet, braided bread is often flavored with citrus zest, spices, and sometimes even studded with dried fruits or nuts. It is traditionally baked during Holy Week and served on Easter Sunday as a symbol of resurrection and new life. The bread is often adorned with dyed eggs, which represent rebirth and renewal.</p>
    <p>For many families, baking Easter bread is a cherished tradition passed down through generations. However, with the rise of gluten-related health issues, many people are seeking ways to adapt these recipes to fit their dietary needs without sacrificing flavor or tradition.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. While it is harmless for most people, those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity can experience severe health issues when consuming gluten. Symptoms can range from digestive discomfort to more serious conditions like nutrient malabsorption and autoimmune reactions. Going gluten-free is not just a dietary choice for these individuals—it’s a necessity.</p>
    <p>Moreover, gluten-free diets have gained popularity among those without gluten-related health issues, as many people report feeling better and experiencing improved digestion when they eliminate gluten from their diets. Whether you’re gluten-free by necessity or choice, there’s no reason to miss out on the joy of Easter bread.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Easter Bread</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free Easter bread is easier than you might think. With the right ingredients and a little patience, you can create a loaf that is just as delicious and beautiful as its traditional counterpart. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you get started.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Activate the yeast:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the warm milk, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, beat the eggs, then add the melted butter, orange zest, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong> Add the yeast mixture and the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms. If using, fold in the raisins or dried fruit.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it rise:</strong> Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the bread:</strong> Divide the dough into three equal parts and roll each into a long rope. Braid the ropes together and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Second rise:</strong> Cover the braided dough and let it rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Brush the bread with an egg wash (1 egg beaten with 1 tbsp water) and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Let the bread cool before slicing. Serve with butter, jam, or enjoy it as is!</li>
