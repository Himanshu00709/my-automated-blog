    <h1>Gluten-Free Turkey Burgers: A Healthy and Delicious Alternative</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by both health-conscious individuals and those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Among the many gluten-free alternatives available, gluten-free turkey burgers have emerged as a popular choice. Not only are they a healthier option compared to traditional beef burgers, but they also offer a versatile and flavorful meal that can be customized to suit various dietary needs. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free turkey burgers, how to make them, and why they should be a staple in your diet.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Turkey Burgers?</h2>

    <p>Turkey burgers are already a healthier alternative to beef burgers due to their lower fat content and higher protein levels.
