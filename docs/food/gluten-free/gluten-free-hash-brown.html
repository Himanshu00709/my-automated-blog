    <h1>Gluten-Free Hash Browns: A Delicious and Healthy Breakfast Option</h1>

    <p>Hash browns are a beloved breakfast staple, known for their crispy exterior and tender interior. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional hash browns can be a source of concern due to potential cross-contamination or hidden gluten ingredients. Enter gluten-free hash browns—a safe and equally delicious alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this classic dish without worry. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free hash browns, from their nutritional benefits to how to make them at home.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Hash Browns?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free hash browns are simply hash browns made without any gluten-containing ingredients. Traditional hash browns are typically made from grated potatoes, which are naturally gluten-free. However, pre-packaged or restaurant-prepared hash browns may contain additives, fillers, or be cooked in shared fryers with gluten-containing foods, making them unsafe for those with gluten intolerance. Gluten-free hash browns ensure that the dish remains free from gluten at every stage of preparation.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Hash Browns</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free hash browns are not only safe for those with gluten sensitivities but also offer several nutritional benefits. Potatoes, the main ingredient in hash browns, are a good source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, potassium, and vitamin B6. When prepared with healthy cooking methods, such as baking or air-frying, gluten-free hash browns can be a low-calorie, nutrient-dense addition to your breakfast.</p>
