    <h1>Gluten-Free Chicken Fried Steak: A Delicious and Healthy Twist</h1>
    <p>Chicken fried steak is a classic comfort food that has been enjoyed for generations. Traditionally, this dish involves tenderized steak coated in a flour-based batter, fried to golden perfection, and served with creamy gravy. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this dish can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free chicken fried steak—a delicious and healthy twist on the classic recipe that allows everyone to indulge without worry.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Chicken Fried Steak?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free chicken fried steak is a variation of the traditional dish that replaces wheat flour with gluten-free alternatives.

The result is a crispy, flavorful steak that is safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. By opting for gluten-free chicken fried steak, you can enjoy a beloved comfort food without the adverse effects of gluten.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free chicken fried steak:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Steak:</strong> Season the cube steaks with salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder on both sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Up the Breading Station:</strong> In one bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. In another bowl, place the gluten-free flour blend.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the Steak:</strong> Dip each steak into the egg mixture, then coat it thoroughly with the gluten-free flour blend. Repeat the process for a double coating if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Steak:</strong> Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the coated steaks into the skillet. Fry for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Serve:</strong> Remove the steaks from the skillet and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. Serve hot with your favorite gluten-free gravy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Chicken Fried Steak</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free chicken fried steak turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for frying, as it will provide the best texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Double Coat for Extra Crispiness:</strong> For an extra crispy crust, consider double-coating the steak by dipping it in the egg mixture and flour blend twice.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor the Oil Temperature:</strong> If the oil is too hot, the steak will burn on the outside before cooking through. If it's not hot enough, the steak will absorb too much oil and become greasy. Aim for a medium-high heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Steak Rest:</strong> After frying, let the steak rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in a more flavorful and tender steak.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chicken Fried Steak</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other cuts of beef, such as sirloin or round steak, as long as they are tenderized. You can also try this recipe with chicken or pork for a different twist.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of eggs for the coating?</h3>
        <p>If you're allergic to eggs or following a vegan diet, you can use a mixture of flaxseed meal and water as an egg substitute. Simply mix 1 tablespoon of flaxseed meal with 3 tablespoons of water and let it sit for a few minutes to thicken.</p>

        <h3>Can I bake the steak instead of frying it?</h3>
