    <h1>Bulgogi Gluten-Free: A Delicious and Healthy Twist on a Korean Classic</h1>

    <p>Bulgogi, a beloved Korean dish, is known for its savory, sweet, and slightly smoky flavors. Traditionally made with thinly sliced beef marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, and other seasonings, bulgogi has become a global favorite. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this dish can be challenging due to the presence of soy sauce, which typically contains gluten. Enter gluten-free bulgogiâ€”a delicious and healthy alternative that allows everyone to savor this Korean classic without compromising on taste or health.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Bulgogi Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Traditional bulgogi recipes rely heavily on soy sauce, which is made from fermented soybeans and wheat. For a gluten-free version, the key is to substitute regular soy sauce with a gluten-free alternative. Gluten-free soy sauce, also known as tamari, is made without wheat and provides the same umami-rich flavor. Additionally, ensuring that all other ingredients, such as marinades and seasonings, are free from gluten is essential to creating a truly gluten-free dish.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Bulgogi</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free bulgogi is straightforward and requires just a few steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Marinade:</strong> In a bowl, combine gluten-free soy sauce, sesame oil, minced garlic, grated ginger, grated pear or apple, and brown sugar or honey. Mix well until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
