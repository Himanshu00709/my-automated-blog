    <h1>Gluten-Free Chicken Shawarma: A Delicious and Healthy Option</h1>
    <p>Shawarma is a beloved Middle Eastern dish that has gained immense popularity worldwide. Traditionally, it consists of marinated meat, such as chicken, beef, or lamb, cooked on a vertical rotisserie and served in a wrap or pita bread. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying shawarma can be a challenge due to the gluten-containing pita bread. Enter gluten-free chicken shawarma—a delicious and healthy alternative that allows everyone to savor this flavorful dish without compromising their dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Chicken Shawarma Gluten-Free?</h2>

Traditional shawarma marinades often include spices like cumin, paprika, turmeric, and garlic, which are all gluten-free. However, some store-bought marinades or spice blends may contain hidden gluten, so it's essential to read labels carefully or make your own marinade at home.</p>
    <p>When it comes to serving, instead of using pita bread, you can opt for gluten-free wraps, lettuce leaves, or even serve the chicken shawarma over a bed of rice or salad. This ensures that the dish remains safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>
