    <h1>Gluten-Free Wiener Schnitzel: A Delicious and Healthy Twist</h1>
    <p>Wiener Schnitzel, a classic Austrian dish, is traditionally made with breaded veal cutlets. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying this crispy delicacy can be a challenge. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can create a gluten-free version that is just as delicious and satisfying. In this article, we’ll explore the history of Wiener Schnitzel, the benefits of going gluten-free, and provide a step-by-step guide to making your own gluten-free Wiener Schnitzel at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Wiener Schnitzel</h2>
    <p>Wiener Schnitzel, which translates to "Viennese cutlet," is a dish that has its roots in Austria. The dish is traditionally made with veal, which is pounded thin, breaded, and then fried to golden perfection. The origins of Wiener Schnitzel are often debated, with some claiming it was brought to Austria from Italy in the 19th century. Regardless of its origins, Wiener Schnitzel has become a beloved dish worldwide, known for its crispy exterior and tender interior.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. A gluten-free diet eliminates these risks and can also offer benefits such as improved digestion, increased energy levels, and better overall health. By making a gluten-free version of Wiener Schnitzel, you can enjoy this classic dish without compromising your health.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free Wiener Schnitzel:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Cutlets:</strong> Place the veal cutlets between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound them with a meat mallet until they are about 1/4 inch thick. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Up Your Breading Station:</strong> In three separate shallow dishes, place the gluten-free flour in the first, beaten eggs in the second, and gluten-free breadcrumbs in the third.</li>
        <li><strong>Bread the Cutlets:</strong> Dredge each cutlet in the gluten-free flour, shaking off any excess. Dip the floured cutlet into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off. Finally, coat the cutlet in the gluten-free breadcrumbs, pressing gently to ensure the breadcrumbs adhere.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Schnitzel:</strong> Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the breaded cutlets. Fry for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Avoid overcrowding the pan; fry in batches if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Transfer the cooked schnitzel to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil. Serve immediately with lemon wedges and your choice of sides, such as a fresh salad or roasted potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
