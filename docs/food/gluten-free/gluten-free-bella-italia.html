    <h2>The Science Behind Gluten-Free Cooking</h2>

    <p>Creating gluten-free versions of traditional Italian dishes is no small feat. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, plays a crucial role in the texture and structure of many foods. For example, gluten gives pasta its elasticity and helps pizza dough rise. Removing gluten from these dishes requires careful consideration of alternative ingredients and cooking techniques.</p>

    <p>At Bella Italia, the chefs use a combination of gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, almond flour, and tapioca starch, to replicate the texture and flavor of traditional Italian dishes. They also employ innovative cooking methods to ensure that their gluten-free pasta and pizza dough have the same mouthfeel and consistency as their gluten-containing counterparts.</p>
