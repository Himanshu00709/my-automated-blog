    <h1>Gluten-Free Pozole: A Hearty and Healthy Tradition</h1>
    <p>Pozole, a traditional Mexican soup, has been a staple in Mexican cuisine for centuries. Known for its rich flavors and hearty ingredients, pozole is often enjoyed during celebrations and family gatherings. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this dish can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free pozole—a delicious and safe alternative that allows everyone to savor this beloved dish without compromising on taste or tradition.</p>

    <h2>What is Pozole?</h2>
    <p>Pozole is a traditional Mexican soup made with hominy (dried corn kernels that have been treated with an alkali solution), meat (usually pork or chicken), and a flavorful broth. It is typically garnished with shredded lettuce, radishes, avocado, lime, and oregano. The dish is often served with tostadas or tortillas on the side. Pozole comes in three main varieties: red (rojo), green (verde), and white (blanco), each distinguished by the type of sauce or broth used.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Traditional pozole is naturally gluten-free, but cross-contamination or the addition of certain ingredients can introduce gluten into the dish. By preparing gluten-free pozole, you can ensure that everyone at the table can enjoy this comforting meal without worry.</p>
