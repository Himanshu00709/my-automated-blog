    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by heating the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, sautéing until they become translucent and fragrant. Next, add the ground beef to the skillet, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Season with salt and pepper, and continue cooking until the beef is fully browned. Drain any excess fat from the skillet.</p>

    <h3>2. Assemble the Enchiladas</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread a thin layer of gluten-free enchilada sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Take each gluten-free corn tortilla and fill it with a portion of the beef mixture, along with a sprinkle of shredded cheese. Roll the tortilla tightly and place it seam-side down in the baking dish. Repeat this process until all the tortillas are filled and arranged in the dish.</p>

    <h3>3. Add the Sauce and Cheese</h3>
    <p>Once all the enchiladas are assembled, pour the remaining enchilada sauce evenly over the top. Make sure each enchilada is well-coated with the sauce. Sprinkle the remaining shredded cheese over the top of the enchiladas, covering them generously.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake and Serve</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Remove the dish from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with optional toppings like avocado slices, fresh cilantro, or a dollop of sour cream.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Beef Enchiladas</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free beef enchiladas offer a range of nutritional benefits. The ground beef provides a high-quality source of protein, which is essential for muscle repair and growth. It’s also rich in iron, which helps prevent anemia and supports overall energy levels. The gluten-free corn tortillas are a good source of fiber, aiding in digestion and promoting a healthy gut. Additionally, the vegetables and spices used in the dish contribute vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support overall health.</p>
