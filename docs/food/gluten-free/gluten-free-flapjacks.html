    <h1>Gluten-Free Flapjacks: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>Flapjacks, a beloved snack in many households, are traditionally made with oats, butter, and golden syrup. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying these treats can be a challenge.

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Safe for Gluten Intolerance:</strong> They are a safe option for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich:</strong> Made with oats, nuts, seeds, and dried fruits, they are packed with essential nutrients.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Boost:</strong> The combination of complex carbohydrates and healthy fats provides a sustained energy release.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> They can be customized with various ingredients to suit different tastes and dietary needs.</li>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Flapjacks</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Are all oats gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>No, not all oats are gluten-free. While oats themselves do not contain gluten, they are often processed in facilities that handle gluten-containing grains, leading to cross-contamination. Always look for oats labeled as "certified gluten-free" to ensure they are safe.</p>

        <h3>Can I use honey instead of golden syrup?</h3>
        <p>Yes, honey can be used as a substitute for golden syrup. However, keep in mind that honey has a stronger flavor, which may alter the taste of your flapjacks slightly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free flapjacks?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free flapjacks can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to three months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make vegan gluten-free flapjacks?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan margarine, and ensure all other ingredients are vegan-friendly.</p>
    </div>

Whether you’re looking for a quick energy boost, a safe treat for gluten intolerance, or simply a tasty snack, gluten-free flapjacks are an excellent choice. With the simple recipe provided, you can easily make them at home and customize them to your liking. So why not give them a try and enjoy a guilt-free treat today?</p>
