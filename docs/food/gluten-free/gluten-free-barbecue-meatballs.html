    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Meatball Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef or turkey, gluten-free breadcrumbs, egg, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly until all ingredients are evenly distributed. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough meatballs.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Shape the Meatballs</h3>
    <p>Using your hands or a small scoop, shape the mixture into evenly sized meatballs, about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Meatballs</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the meatballs for 20-25 minutes, or until they are fully cooked and reach an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). Baking ensures even cooking and reduces the need for excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Coat with Barbecue Sauce</h3>
    <p>Once the meatballs are cooked, transfer them to a large bowl and toss them with your favorite gluten-free barbecue sauce. Ensure each meatball is evenly coated. You can also return them to the oven for an additional 5-10 minutes to caramelize the sauce slightly.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free barbecue meatballs are incredibly versatile and can be served in a variety of ways. Here are some ideas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>As an appetizer:</strong> Serve them on toothpicks or skewers for easy grabbing at parties.</li>
        <li><strong>As a main dish:</strong> Pair them with gluten-free pasta, rice, or a fresh salad for a complete meal.</li>
        <li><strong>In a sandwich:</strong> Use gluten-free buns or lettuce wraps for a delicious barbecue meatball sandwich.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Barbecue Meatballs</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free barbecue meatballs offer several health benefits, especially for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. By eliminating gluten, you reduce the risk of digestive discomfort, inflammation, and other symptoms associated with gluten intolerance. Additionally, using lean ground beef or turkey can make the dish lower in fat and calories, while still providing a good source of protein. The use of gluten-free breadcrumbs, often made from whole grains like quinoa or oats, can also add fiber and nutrients to the dish.</p>
