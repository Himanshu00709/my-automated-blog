    <h1>Gluten-Free Swedish Meatballs: A Delicious and Healthy Twist</h1>
    <p>Swedish meatballs are a beloved dish worldwide, known for their rich, creamy sauce and tender, flavorful meatballs. Traditionally, this dish contains gluten, which can be a problem for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, with a few simple substitutions, you can enjoy gluten-free Swedish meatballs that are just as delicious and satisfying as the original. In this article, we’ll explore the history of Swedish meatballs, how to make them gluten-free, and answer some common questions about this delightful dish.</p>

    <h2>The History of Swedish Meatballs</h2>
    <p>Swedish meatballs, or "köttbullar," have been a staple in Swedish cuisine for centuries. The dish is believed to have been introduced to Sweden in the 18th century by King Charles XII, who brought the recipe back from Turkey. Over time, the recipe evolved to include local ingredients and flavors, becoming the dish we know and love today. Traditionally, Swedish meatballs are made with a mixture of ground beef and pork, breadcrumbs, milk, and spices, all bound together and then fried or baked. They are typically served with a creamy gravy, lingonberry jam, and mashed potatoes or egg noodles.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to fatigue and joint pain. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it’s commonly used as a binder in meatballs. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets, many people are looking for ways to enjoy their favorite dishes without the negative effects of gluten. Gluten-free Swedish meatballs are a perfect solution, offering all the flavor and comfort of the traditional dish without the gluten.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Swedish Meatballs</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free Swedish meatballs is easier than you might think. The key is to replace the breadcrumbs with a gluten-free alternative and to ensure that all other ingredients, including the gravy, are gluten-free. Here’s a step-by-step guide to making your own gluten-free Swedish meatballs at home:</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Meatballs:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, ground pork, gluten-free breadcrumbs, milk, onion, garlic, egg, salt, pepper, allspice, and nutmeg. Mix until well combined. Shape the mixture into small meatballs, about 1 inch in diameter.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Meatballs:</strong> In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the meatballs and cook until browned on all sides and cooked through, about 10-12 minutes. Remove the meatballs from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Gravy:</strong> In the same skillet, add the gluten-free flour and whisk to combine with the remaining butter. Gradually add the beef broth, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the heavy cream and return the meatballs to the skillet. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, or until the meatballs are heated through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the gluten-free Swedish meatballs with mashed potatoes or egg noodles, and a side of lingonberry jam if desired.</li>
