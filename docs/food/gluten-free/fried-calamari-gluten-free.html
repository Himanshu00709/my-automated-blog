    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Fried Calamari at Home</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free fried calamari at home is easier than you might think. With a few simple ingredients and some basic cooking techniques, you can create a restaurant-quality dish in the comfort of your own kitchen. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of fresh calamari rings</li>
        <li>1 cup of gluten-free flour (such as rice flour or almond flour)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup of buttermilk (or a dairy-free alternative)</li>
        <li>Oil for frying (such as vegetable or coconut oil)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium-sized bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to ensure the spices are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Pour the buttermilk into a separate bowl. Dip each calamari ring into the buttermilk, ensuring it is fully coated.</li>
        <li>Next, dredge the buttermilk-coated calamari rings in the gluten-free flour mixture, making sure they are evenly coated on all sides.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a deep frying pan or pot over medium-high heat. The oil should be hot but not smoking.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the coated calamari rings into the hot oil, frying them in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Fry for 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove the fried calamari rings from the oil using a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauce, such as marinara or aioli.</li>
    </ol>
