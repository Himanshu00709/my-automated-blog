    <h1>Gluten-Free Cuban Sandwich: A Delicious Twist on a Classic</h1>
    <p>The Cuban sandwich, a beloved staple of Cuban cuisine, is a flavorful combination of roasted pork, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard, all pressed between slices of crusty bread. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic sandwich can be a challenge. Enter the gluten-free Cuban sandwich—a delicious and inclusive twist on the traditional recipe that allows everyone to savor its mouthwatering flavors. In this article, we’ll explore the history of the Cuban sandwich, how to make a gluten-free version, and tips for perfecting this culinary delight.</p>

    <h2>The History of the Cuban Sandwich</h2>
    <p>The Cuban sandwich, or "Cubano," has its roots in the late 19th century, when Cuban immigrants brought their culinary traditions to Florida, particularly to Tampa and Miami. The sandwich became a popular lunch option for workers in cigar factories and sugar mills.

Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe digestive issues and other health problems for those with sensitivities. Fortunately, with the rise of gluten-free products and recipes, it’s easier than ever to enjoy classic dishes like the Cuban sandwich without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>How to Make a Gluten-Free Cuban Sandwich</h2>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Bread:</strong> Slice the gluten-free bread into sandwich-sized portions. Lightly butter the outside of each slice to ensure a crispy finish when pressed.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer the Ingredients:</strong> On the inside of one slice, spread a thin layer of yellow mustard. Layer the roasted pork, ham, Swiss cheese, and pickles evenly on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Sandwich:</strong> Place the second slice of bread on top to complete the sandwich.</li>
        <li><strong>Press the Sandwich:</strong> Heat a sandwich press or a skillet over medium heat. Place the sandwich in the press or skillet and press down firmly. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Remove the sandwich from the press, slice it diagonally, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Cuban Sandwich</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Bread:</strong> Opt for a high-quality gluten-free bread that mimics the texture of traditional Cuban bread. Look for options that are crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> The quality of your ingredients will greatly impact the flavor of your sandwich. Use freshly roasted pork, high-quality ham, and crisp pickles for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Press:</strong> Pressing the sandwich is crucial for achieving the signature crispy texture. If you don’t have a sandwich press, you can use a heavy skillet and press down with a spatula or another pan.</li>
    </ul>
