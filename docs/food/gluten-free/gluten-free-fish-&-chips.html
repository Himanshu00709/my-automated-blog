    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Fish & Chips at Home</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free fish and chips at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create this delicious dish:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Fish</h3>
    <p>Start by selecting fresh, high-quality fish such as cod or haddock. Pat the fish dry with paper towels to ensure the batter adheres properly. Cut the fish into portion-sized pieces.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Gluten-Free Batter</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine your chosen gluten-free flour (such as rice flour or chickpea flour) with a pinch of salt and baking powder. Gradually add cold sparkling water or gluten-free beer to create a smooth, thick batter. The carbonation helps create a light and crispy coating.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Coat the Fish</h3>
    <p>Dip each piece of fish into the batter, ensuring it’s fully coated. For extra crunch, you can roll the battered fish in gluten-free breadcrumbs or cornmeal before frying.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Fry the Fish</h3>
    <p>Heat your oil to 350°F (175°C) in a deep fryer or large pot. Carefully place the battered fish into the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy, usually about 4-6 minutes. Remove the fish and place it on a wire rack or paper towels to drain excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Prepare the Chips</h3>
    <p>Cut your potatoes into thick chips and soak them in cold water for 30 minutes to remove excess starch. Dry them thoroughly, then fry in the same oil at a lower temperature (300°F or 150°C) until soft. Increase the heat to 375°F (190°C) and fry again until golden and crispy.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve your gluten-free fish and chips with a side of gluten-free tartar sauce, mushy peas, or a fresh salad. Add a wedge of lemon for a burst of citrus flavor.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fish & Chips</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Is gluten-free fish and chips healthier than the traditional version?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free fish and chips can be a healthier option for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. However, the healthiness of the dish depends on the ingredients and cooking methods used. Opting for baked or air-fried versions can reduce the calorie and fat content.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I use any type of fish for gluten-free fish and chips?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any type of fish you prefer. Popular choices include cod, haddock, and pollock, but you can also experiment with salmon, tilapia, or even shrimp.</p>

        <h3>3. What are the best gluten-free flours for the batter?</h3>
        <p>Rice flour, almond flour, and chickpea flour are excellent choices for gluten-free batter. Each flour offers a unique flavor and texture, so feel free to experiment to find your favorite.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make gluten-free fish and chips in an air fryer?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Using an air fryer is a great way to make a healthier version of gluten-free fish and chips. Simply coat the fish and chips as usual, then cook in the air fryer at 400°F (200°C) for about 10-15 minutes, flipping halfway through.</p>
    </div>
