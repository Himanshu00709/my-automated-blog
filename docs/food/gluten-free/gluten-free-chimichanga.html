    <h1>Gluten-Free Chimichanga: A Delicious and Healthy Twist</h1>

    <p>Chimichangas are a beloved Mexican dish, known for their crispy exterior and flavorful fillings. Traditionally, chimichangas are made with wheat flour tortillas, which contain gluten. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, the demand for gluten-free alternatives has grown. Enter the gluten-free chimichanga—a delicious and healthy twist on the classic dish that everyone can enjoy.</p>

    <h2>What is a Gluten-Free Chimichanga?</h2>

    <p>A gluten-free chimichanga is essentially a chimichanga made with gluten-free tortillas. These tortillas are typically made from alternative flours such as corn, rice, almond, or cassava. The fillings remain the same, often including seasoned meats, beans, cheese, and vegetables. The chimichanga is then deep-fried or baked to achieve that signature crispy texture.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe digestive issues and long-term health problems. Others may have non-celiac gluten sensitivity, experiencing symptoms like bloating, headaches, and fatigue after consuming gluten. Additionally, some people choose a gluten-free diet for its potential health benefits, such as improved digestion and reduced inflammation.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Chimichangas</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free chimichangas is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create a delicious and crispy chimichanga:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the cooked chicken or beef, black beans, cheese, salsa, and spices. Mix well to ensure the filling is evenly seasoned.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Chimichangas:</strong> Lay out a gluten-free tortilla and place a generous portion of the filling in the center. Fold the sides of the tortilla over the filling, then roll it up tightly to form a burrito shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Chimichangas:</strong> Heat oil in a deep skillet or fryer to 350°F (175°C). Carefully place the chimichangas in the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side. Alternatively, you can bake them in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Remove the chimichangas from the oil or oven and let them cool slightly. Serve with additional salsa, guacamole, or sour cream on the side.</li>
