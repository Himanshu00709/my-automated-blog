    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free blooming onion:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Onion:</strong> Peel the onion and cut off the top (about 1/4 inch). Place the onion cut-side down and make vertical cuts from the top down, stopping about 1/2 inch from the bottom. Gently separate the layers to create the "bloom."</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Batter:</strong> In a bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cornstarch, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. In another bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the Onion:</strong> Dip the onion into the egg mixture, making sure to coat all the layers. Then, dredge it in the flour mixture, ensuring an even coating. Repeat the process for a thicker batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Onion:</strong> Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 375°F (190°C). Carefully lower the onion into the hot oil, cut-side down. Fry for about 3-4 minutes, then flip and fry for another 3-4 minutes until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Serve:</strong> Remove the onion from the oil and let it drain on paper towels. Serve with your favorite gluten-free dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Blooming Onion</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free blooming onion turns out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Onion:</strong> A large, sweet onion works best for this recipe. The size and sweetness of the onion will enhance the overall flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Double Coat for Extra Crispiness:</strong> For an extra crispy texture, consider double-coating the onion by dipping it in the egg mixture and flour mixture twice.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor the Oil Temperature:</strong> Maintaining the correct oil temperature is crucial. If the oil is too hot, the onion will burn; if it’s too cool, the onion will absorb too much oil and become greasy.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Deep Fryer or Heavy Pot:</strong> A deep fryer is ideal for this recipe, but if you don’t have one, a heavy pot with high sides will work. Just be sure to use a thermometer to monitor the oil temperature.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>Can I bake a gluten-free blooming onion instead of frying it?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake a gluten-free blooming onion, but the texture will be different. To bake, preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and place the coated onion on a baking sheet. Bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy. Keep in mind that baking may not achieve the same level of crispiness as frying.</p>

        <h3>What dipping sauces are gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Many dipping sauces are naturally gluten-free, but always check the labels to be sure. Some popular gluten-free options include ranch dressing, honey mustard, and aioli. You can also make your own dipping sauce using gluten-free ingredients.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a vegan version of the gluten-free blooming onion by using a plant-based milk (such as almond or soy milk) and a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of regular eggs.</p>
