<h1>Gluten-Free Poutine Gravy: A Delicious Twist on a Canadian Classic</h1>

<p>Poutine, the iconic Canadian dish, is a comforting blend of crispy fries, squeaky cheese curds, and rich, savory gravy. Traditionally, poutine gravy is made with a roux that includes wheat flour, making it off-limits for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets, there's no need to miss out on this beloved dish. Gluten-free poutine gravy is not only possible but can be just as delicious as the original. In this article, we'll explore how to make gluten-free poutine gravy, its health benefits, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

<h2>What is Poutine Gravy?</h2>

<p>Poutine gravy is a key component of the classic Canadian dish, poutine. It's typically a thick, savory sauce made from a roux (a mixture of fat and flour), beef or chicken stock, and seasonings. The gravy is poured over a bed of crispy fries and cheese curds, creating a dish that's both hearty and indulgent. For those who need to avoid gluten, traditional poutine gravy can be problematic due to the use of wheat flour in the roux. However, with a few simple substitutions, you can create a gluten-free version that's just as satisfying.</p>

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Poutine Gravy</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free poutine gravy is easier than you might think. The key is to replace the wheat flour in the roux with a gluten-free alternative. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a delicious gluten-free poutine gravy:</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Roux:</strong> In a saucepan, melt the butter or margarine over medium heat. Once melted, add the gluten-free flour and whisk continuously until the mixture becomes smooth and slightly golden in color. This should take about 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the Stock:</strong> Gradually pour in the beef or chicken stock, whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Continue to whisk until the mixture is smooth and well combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Season the Gravy:</strong> Add the onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper to the saucepan. Stir well to incorporate the seasonings.</li>
    <li><strong>Simmer:</strong> Reduce the heat to low and let the gravy simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. The gravy should thicken as it simmers. If it becomes too thick, you can add a bit more stock to reach your desired consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once the gravy has reached the desired thickness, remove it from the heat. Pour it over a plate of crispy fries and cheese curds, and enjoy your gluten-free poutine!</li>
</ol>
