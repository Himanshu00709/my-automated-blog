<h1>Gluten-Free Rubios: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the general desire for healthier eating habits. Rubio's Coastal Grill, a popular fast-casual restaurant chain known for its fresh and flavorful Mexican-inspired cuisine, has stepped up to meet this demand by offering a variety of gluten-free options. This blog post will delve into the world of gluten-free Rubios, exploring the menu options, nutritional considerations, and tips for dining safely.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to a host of health issues. Even for those without celiac disease, gluten sensitivity can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. As a result, many people are opting for gluten-free diets to improve their overall health and well-being.</p>

<p>Rubio's has recognized the importance of catering to this growing demographic by offering a range of gluten-free menu items. However, it's crucial to understand that while Rubio's takes steps to minimize cross-contamination, the risk is not entirely eliminated. Therefore, individuals with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease should exercise caution and communicate their dietary needs clearly when ordering.</p>
