    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Cook the Gluten-Free Pasta</h3>
    <p>Start by cooking the gluten-free elbow macaroni according to the package instructions. Be sure to cook it al dente, as it will continue to cook in the oven later. Once cooked, drain the pasta and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Cheese Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in the gluten-free flour to create a roux. Cook the roux for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burning. Gradually add the milk and heavy cream, whisking continuously to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook until it thickens, about 5 minutes.</p>

    <h3>3. Add the Cheese</h3>
    <p>Reduce the heat to low and stir in the shredded cheddar, Gruyère, and grated Parmesan cheese. Continue stirring until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth. Season with salt, pepper, and paprika to taste.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Pasta, Lobster, and Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta, lobster meat, and cheese sauce. Gently fold everything together until the pasta and lobster are evenly coated with the sauce.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish and sprinkle the top with additional Parmesan cheese if desired. Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</p>

    <h3>6. Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once out of the oven, let the dish cool for a few minutes before garnishing with fresh parsley. Serve hot and enjoy the luxurious combination of flavors and textures.</p>
