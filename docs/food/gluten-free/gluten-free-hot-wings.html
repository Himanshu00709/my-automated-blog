    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Hot Wings</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free hot wings turn out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Almond flour, rice flour, and tapioca flour are excellent gluten-free alternatives for coating the wings. They provide a crispy texture without the gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Your Hot Sauce:</strong> Not all hot sauces are gluten-free. Always read the label to ensure the sauce doesn’t contain any hidden gluten ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Baking Rack:</strong> Placing the wings on a baking rack instead of directly on the baking sheet allows for even cooking and crispiness on all sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Don’t be afraid to get creative with your sauce. Add honey for a sweet and spicy kick, or incorporate herbs like cilantro for a fresh twist.</li>
    </ul>
