<h1>Boston Pizza Gluten-Free Options: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free menu at Boston Pizza, discuss the precautions they take to avoid cross-contamination, and provide tips for enjoying a safe and delicious meal.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining</h2>

<p>Boston Pizza, a popular Canadian restaurant chain, has recognized the importance of providing gluten-free choices. Their menu includes a variety of dishes that are either naturally gluten-free or have been modified to remove gluten-containing ingredients. However, it’s important to note that while Boston Pizza takes precautions to avoid cross-contamination, they cannot guarantee that their gluten-free items are completely free from gluten due to the shared kitchen environment.</p>
