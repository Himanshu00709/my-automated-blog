<h1>Best Gluten-Free Fish and Chips: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Fish and chips is a classic British dish that has won hearts worldwide. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying this crispy, golden delight can be a challenge. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free options has made it possible for everyone to savor this iconic meal. In this guide, we’ll explore the best gluten-free fish and chips, from homemade recipes to top restaurant picks, and provide tips for ensuring a safe and delicious experience.</p>

<h2>Why Gluten-Free Fish and Chips?</h2>

<p>Traditional fish and chips are coated in a batter made from wheat flour, which contains gluten. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, fatigue, and long-term damage to the intestines. Gluten-free fish and chips use alternative flours, such as rice flour, cornflour, or chickpea flour, to create a crispy, gluten-free batter that’s just as satisfying as the original.</p>
