    <h1>Gluten-Free Kimchi: A Healthy Fermented Delight</h1>
    <p>Kimchi, the iconic Korean fermented vegetable dish, has gained global popularity for its unique flavor and numerous health benefits. Traditionally made with napa cabbage, radishes, and a variety of seasonings, kimchi is a staple in Korean cuisine. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying traditional kimchi can be a challenge due to the presence of gluten in some ingredients.
