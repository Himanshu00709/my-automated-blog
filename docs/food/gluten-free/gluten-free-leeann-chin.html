As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to improve their health and well-being.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Concerns</h2>

    <p>To minimize the risk of cross-contamination, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Communicate with Staff:</strong> Inform the staff about your gluten-free dietary needs and ask about their preparation methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Request Separate Utensils:</strong> Ask for your meal to be prepared with clean utensils and in a separate area if possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Shared Fryers:</strong> Some dishes, like spring rolls, may be fried in shared oil, which can contain gluten. Opt for steamed or stir-fried options instead.</li>
    </ul>
