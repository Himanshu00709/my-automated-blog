    <h1>Gluten-Free Belgian Waffles: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>Belgian waffles are a beloved breakfast staple, known for their light, fluffy texture and deep pockets perfect for holding syrup, fruit, or whipped cream.

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Belgian Waffles at Home</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free Belgian waffles at home is easier than you might think. With the right ingredients and a good waffle iron, you can create a batch of waffles that are just as delicious as any you’d find in a restaurant. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups milk (or dairy-free alternative)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup melted butter (or coconut oil for a dairy-free option)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your waffle iron according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and then add the milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease the waffle iron with cooking spray or a small amount of butter.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter onto the preheated waffle iron, using about 1/2 cup of batter per waffle. Close the lid and cook until the waffles are golden brown and crisp.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with your favorite toppings, such as fresh fruit, syrup, or whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Belgian Waffles</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free Belgian waffles turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right balance of flours and starches to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense, tough waffles. Mix the batter until just combined, and it’s okay if there are a few lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Batter Rest:</strong> Allowing the batter to rest for 5-10 minutes before cooking can help the flours absorb the liquid, resulting in a better texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook at the Right Temperature:</strong> Make sure your waffle iron is fully preheated before adding the batter. Cooking at the right temperature ensures that the waffles cook evenly and become crispy on the outside.</li>
    </ul>
