    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Fajitas</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free fajitas is a straightforward process that involves a few simple steps. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating this delicious dish:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Protein</h3>
    <p>Choose your preferred protein, such as chicken, beef, or shrimp. Slice the protein into thin strips and marinate it in a gluten-free fajita seasoning blend. Allow the protein to marinate for at least 30 minutes to absorb the flavors.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>While the protein is marinating, slice bell peppers and onions into thin strips. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add a tablespoon of oil. Sauté the vegetables until they are tender and slightly caramelized, which should take about 5-7 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the skillet and set them aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Protein</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of oil and cook the marinated protein until it is fully cooked and slightly charred. This should take about 5-7 minutes, depending on the type of protein you’re using.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Warm the Tortillas</h3>
    <p>While the protein is cooking, warm your gluten-free tortillas. You can do this by placing them in a dry skillet for a few seconds on each side or by wrapping them in foil and heating them in the oven.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Assemble the Fajitas</h3>
    <p>Once everything is ready, assemble your fajitas by placing a portion of the cooked protein and vegetables onto a warm tortilla. Add your favorite toppings, such as sour cream, guacamole, or salsa, and fold the tortilla to enclose the filling. Serve immediately and enjoy!</p>
