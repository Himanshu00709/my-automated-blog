    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Cook the Gluten-Free Pasta</h3>
    <p>Start by cooking the gluten-free pasta according to the package instructions. Be sure to cook it al dente, as it will continue to cook slightly when baked. Once cooked, drain the pasta and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Cheese Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the gluten-free flour and whisk continuously to create a roux. Cook for about 1-2 minutes until the mixture is smooth and slightly golden. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook until it thickens, about 3-5 minutes.</p>

    <h3>3. Add the Cheese</h3>
    <p>Reduce the heat to low and stir in the shredded cheddar cheese and grated Parmesan cheese. Continue stirring until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Pasta, Chicken, and Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta, shredded chicken, and cheese sauce. Stir until everything is evenly coated.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake (Optional)</h3>
    <p>If you prefer a baked version, transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish. Sprinkle additional cheese on top if desired. Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</p>

    <h3>6. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once baked (or if you’re serving it straight from the stovetop), let the dish cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or chives for an extra touch of flavor.</p>
