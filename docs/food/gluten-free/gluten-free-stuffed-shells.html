    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Cook the Gluten-Free Pasta Shells</h3>

    <p>Begin by cooking the gluten-free jumbo pasta shells according to the package instructions. Be sure to cook them al dente, as they will continue to cook in the oven. Once cooked, drain the shells and set them aside to cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Cheese Filling</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, egg, and chopped parsley. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Mix everything together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>3. Stuff the Shells</h3>

    <p>Using a spoon or a piping bag, fill each cooked pasta shell with the cheese mixture. Be generous with the filling, but be careful not to overstuff the shells, as they may burst during baking.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Dish</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange the stuffed shells in the dish, seam side up. Pour the remaining marinara sauce over the top of the shells, ensuring they are well-covered.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake the Stuffed Shells</h3>

    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, remove the foil and sprinkle additional shredded mozzarella cheese on top. Return the dish to the oven and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</p>

    <h3>6. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once the stuffed shells are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired, and serve warm. Enjoy your gluten-free stuffed shells with a side salad or garlic bread for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Stuffed Shells</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Pasta:</strong> Not all gluten-free pasta is created equal. Look for brands that are known for their quality and texture. Some popular options include Barilla, Jovial, and Tinkyada.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overcook the Pasta:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can become mushy if overcooked. Be sure to cook it al dente to maintain the perfect texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize the Filling:</strong> Feel free to get creative with the filling. You can add spinach, mushrooms, or even cooked ground meat to the cheese mixture for added flavor and nutrition.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> Gluten-free stuffed shells can be assembled ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator until ready to bake. This makes them a great option for meal prep or entertaining.</li>
    </ul>
