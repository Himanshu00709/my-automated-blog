    <h1>Gluten-Free Pad See Ew: A Delicious Twist on a Thai Classic</h1>
    <p>Pad See Ew, a beloved Thai street food dish, is known for its savory, slightly sweet flavors and chewy rice noodles. Traditionally, this dish is made with soy sauce, which contains gluten, making it off-limits for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, with a few simple substitutions, you can enjoy a gluten-free version of this classic dish that’s just as delicious and satisfying. In this article, we’ll explore the origins of Pad See Ew, the key ingredients for a gluten-free version, and step-by-step instructions to make it at home.</p>

    <h2>The Origins of Pad See Ew</h2>
    <p>Pad See Ew, which translates to "stir-fried soy sauce noodles," is a staple in Thai cuisine. It’s a dish that’s deeply rooted in the street food culture of Thailand, where it’s commonly served from food carts and small eateries. The dish is characterized by its wide rice noodles, which are stir-fried with a combination of soy sauce, oyster sauce, and a touch of sugar. The result is a harmonious blend of savory, sweet, and umami flavors, often accompanied by Chinese broccoli, eggs, and your choice of protein, such as chicken, beef, or tofu.</p>
    <p>While the traditional recipe is undeniably delicious, the use of soy sauce and oyster sauce—both of which typically contain gluten—poses a challenge for those following a gluten-free diet. Fortunately, with the rise of gluten-free alternatives, it’s now easier than ever to recreate this dish without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <p>When shopping for gluten-free ingredients, always check the labels to ensure that the products are certified gluten-free. Cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing, so it’s important to choose brands that adhere to strict gluten-free standards.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Pad See Ew</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your gluten-free ingredients ready, let’s dive into the cooking process. Follow these steps to create a mouthwatering gluten-free Pad See Ew at home:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Noodles</h3>
    <p>Start by soaking the wide rice noodles in warm water for about 20-30 minutes, or until they are pliable but not fully cooked. Drain the noodles and set them aside. This step ensures that the noodles will cook evenly when stir-fried.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of gluten-free soy sauce (or tamari), 1 tablespoon of gluten-free oyster sauce, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and a pinch of white pepper. Mix well and set aside. This sauce will be the flavor base for your dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Stir-Fry the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Heat a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat and add a tablespoon of oil. Add your choice of protein (chicken, beef, or tofu) and stir-fry until cooked through. Push the protein to one side of the wok and crack an egg into the empty space. Scramble the egg until it’s fully cooked, then mix it with the protein.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Vegetables and Noodles</h3>
    <p>Add the Chinese broccoli (or other vegetables) to the wok and stir-fry for a minute or two until they start to soften. Then, add the soaked rice noodles and pour the prepared sauce over the top. Use tongs or a spatula to toss everything together, ensuring that the noodles are evenly coated with the sauce.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the noodles are heated through and the vegetables are tender, your gluten-free Pad See Ew is ready to serve. Garnish with a sprinkle of crushed peanuts or a squeeze of lime juice for an extra burst of flavor.</p>
