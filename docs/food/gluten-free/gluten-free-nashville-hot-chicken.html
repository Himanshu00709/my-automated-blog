    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> Place the chicken pieces in a bowl and cover them with buttermilk. Let them marinate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Breading:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the Chicken:</strong> Remove the chicken from the buttermilk, allowing any excess to drip off. Dredge each piece in the flour mixture, ensuring an even coating.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Chicken:</strong> Heat the vegetable oil in a deep skillet or fryer to 350°F (175°C). Carefully place the chicken pieces in the hot oil and fry until golden brown and cooked through, about 10-12 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Spicy Paste:</strong> In a small saucepan, combine the cayenne pepper, brown sugar, and a few tablespoons of the frying oil. Heat until the sugar dissolves and the mixture becomes a paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the Chicken:</strong> Brush the spicy paste over the fried chicken pieces, ensuring they are fully coated. Serve immediately with your favorite sides, such as pickles and gluten-free bread.</li>
    </ol>
