    <h1>Gluten-Free Chili Relleno: A Delicious and Healthy Twist</h1>
    <p>Chili Relleno is a classic Mexican dish that has been enjoyed for generations. Traditionally, it consists of a roasted poblano pepper stuffed with cheese, dipped in an egg batter, and fried to golden perfection. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the traditional recipe can be off-limits due to the use of wheat flour in the batter. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can enjoy a gluten-free version of this beloved dish without sacrificing flavor or texture.</p>

    <h2>What is Chili Relleno?</h2>
    <p>Chili Relleno, which translates to "stuffed chili," is a dish that originated in the Puebla region of Mexico. The dish typically features a poblano pepper that is roasted, peeled, and stuffed with cheese, meat, or a combination of both. The stuffed pepper is then coated in a light batter and fried until crispy. The result is a dish that is both rich and satisfying, with a perfect balance of spicy, savory, and cheesy flavors.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it is commonly used in batters and coatings for fried foods. By making a gluten-free version of Chili Relleno, you can enjoy this delicious dish without the negative health effects associated with gluten consumption.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Roast the Poblano Peppers</h3>
    <p>Start by roasting the poblano peppers. You can do this by placing them directly over a gas flame or under a broiler until the skin is blistered and charred. Once roasted, place the peppers in a bowl and cover them with plastic wrap to steam. This will make it easier to peel off the skin.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Cheese Filling</h3>
    <p>While the peppers are steaming, prepare the cheese filling. Shred the queso fresco or Monterey Jack cheese and set it aside. Once the peppers are cool enough to handle, carefully peel off the skin, make a small slit in each pepper, and remove the seeds. Be sure to leave the stem intact for presentation.</p>

    <h3>3. Stuff the Peppers</h3>
    <p>Stuff each pepper with the shredded cheese, making sure not to overfill. You can also add cooked ground beef or shredded chicken for a heartier filling if desired.</p>

    <h3>4. Prepare the Gluten-Free Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, separate the egg whites from the yolks. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. In a separate bowl, mix the egg yolks with the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Gently fold the egg whites into the yolk mixture to create a light and airy batter.</p>

    <h3>5. Coat and Fry the Peppers</h3>
    <p>Heat vegetable oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Dip each stuffed pepper into the batter, making sure it is evenly coated. Carefully place the peppers in the hot oil and fry until golden brown on all sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove the peppers from the oil and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</p>

    <h3>6. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve the gluten-free Chili Relleno immediately, garnished with fresh cilantro, salsa, or a dollop of sour cream. Pair it with a side of Mexican rice or a fresh salad for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of pepper?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other types of peppers such as Anaheim or bell peppers, but keep in mind that the flavor and heat level will vary.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of queso fresco?</h3>
        <p>If you can't find queso fresco, you can substitute it with Monterey Jack, mozzarella, or even a mild cheddar cheese.</p>

        <h3>Can I bake the Chili Relleno instead of frying?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake the stuffed peppers at 375°F (190°C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the peppers are tender. However, the texture will be slightly different from the fried version.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>To make this recipe vegan, you can use a plant-based cheese and substitute the eggs with a flaxseed or chia seed egg mixture. However, the texture may vary.</p>
