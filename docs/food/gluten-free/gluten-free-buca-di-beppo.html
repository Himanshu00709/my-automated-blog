<ol>
    <li><strong>Communicate Clearly:</strong> When placing your order, inform your server about your gluten intolerance or celiac disease. This will help them take extra precautions.</li>
    <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> Don’t hesitate to ask about ingredients or preparation methods if you’re unsure about a dish.</li>
    <li><strong>Check the Menu:</strong> Buca di Beppo’s gluten-free menu is regularly updated, but it’s always a good idea to double-check for any changes or new additions.</li>
