    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Breakfast Tacos</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free breakfast tacos is a straightforward process that can be done in under 20 minutes. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gather all your ingredients and chop any vegetables or protein sources you plan to use. This will make the cooking process smoother and faster.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Protein</h3>
    <p>If you’re using meat or beans, cook them first. For example, sauté turkey bacon or chicken sausage in a pan until fully cooked. If you’re using black beans, you can heat them up in a separate pan or microwave.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Scramble the Eggs</h3>
    <p>In a separate pan, scramble your eggs. You can add a splash of milk or dairy-free alternative for extra creaminess. Season with salt, pepper, and any other spices you like.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Warm the Tortillas</h3>
    <p>Heat your gluten-free tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave for a few seconds to make them pliable. This will prevent them from cracking when you fold them.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Assemble the Tacos</h3>
    <p>Lay out your warm tortillas and start layering your ingredients. Add the scrambled eggs, cooked protein, vegetables, and cheese. Top with salsa, hot sauce, or any other condiments you enjoy.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Fold your tacos and serve them immediately. Pair with a side of fresh fruit or a smoothie for a complete breakfast.</p>
