    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to make perfect gluten-free potato wedges:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Set your oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the potatoes:</strong> Wash and scrub the potatoes thoroughly. Cut them into wedges by slicing each potato in half lengthwise, then cutting each half into 3-4 wedges.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the wedges:</strong> In a large bowl, toss the potato wedges with olive oil, salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder until evenly coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Arrange on the baking sheet:</strong> Place the wedges in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, ensuring they are not overcrowded.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 25-30 minutes, flipping the wedges halfway through, until they are golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before serving. Enjoy with your favorite dipping sauce!</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Potato Wedges</h2>
    <p>Here are some expert tips to ensure your potato wedges turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the right potatoes:</strong> Russet or Yukon Gold potatoes are ideal for wedges because of their starchy texture, which helps them crisp up nicely.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t skip the oil:</strong> Olive oil not only adds flavor but also helps the wedges crisp up in the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Flip halfway through:</strong> Flipping the wedges ensures even cooking and browning on both sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with seasonings:</strong> Feel free to add other spices like chili powder, cumin, or rosemary for a unique flavor twist.</li>
