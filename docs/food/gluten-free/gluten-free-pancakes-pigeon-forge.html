    <h3>2. Can I make gluten-free pancakes without eggs?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make gluten-free pancakes without eggs by using egg substitutes such as flax eggs, chia eggs, or commercial egg replacers. These alternatives work well in gluten-free pancake recipes and help bind the ingredients together.</p>

    <h3>3. What are the best toppings for gluten-free pancakes?</h3>
    <p>The best toppings for gluten-free pancakes are those that add flavor and nutrition without overwhelming the dish.

For a decadent treat, you can also add a dollop of whipped cream or a sprinkle of dark chocolate chips.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I freeze gluten-free pancakes?</h3>
    <p>Yes, gluten-free pancakes freeze well. Allow them to cool completely, then place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze until solid.
