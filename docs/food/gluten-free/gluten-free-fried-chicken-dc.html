    <h1>Gluten-Free Fried Chicken in DC: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Washington, DC, is a city known for its diverse culinary scene, and for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding delicious gluten-free options can be a challenge. However, the rise of gluten-free dining has made it easier than ever to enjoy classic comfort foods like fried chicken without the worry. In this guide, we’ll explore the best spots in DC for gluten-free fried chicken, what makes it unique, and why it’s a must-try for anyone looking to indulge in a crispy, flavorful meal.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Fried Chicken?</h2>
    <p>Fried chicken is a beloved dish across the United States, but traditional recipes often rely on wheat flour for the crispy coating. For those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, this can be a problem. Gluten-free fried chicken, however, uses alternative flours like rice flour, cornmeal, or almond flour to achieve that same satisfying crunch. Not only is it a safer option for those with dietary restrictions, but it also offers a unique flavor profile that can be just as delicious—if not more so—than its traditional counterpart.</p>
