    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Calamari:</strong> Start by cleaning the calamari thoroughly and slicing it into rings. Pat the rings dry with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Create the Coating:</strong> In a bowl, mix the gluten-free flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper. This mixture will serve as the coating for the calamari.</li>
        <li><strong>Dip and Coat:</strong> Dip each calamari ring into the beaten eggs, then coat it evenly with the flour mixture. Make sure each ring is well-coated for a crispy finish.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong> In a deep frying pan, heat the oil to 350°F (175°C). Ensure the oil is hot enough to fry the calamari quickly without absorbing too much oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Calamari:</strong> Carefully place the coated calamari rings into the hot oil. Fry them in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Cook for about 2-3 minutes or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Serve:</strong> Remove the fried calamari from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil. Serve immediately with lemon wedges and your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Fried Calamari</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free fried calamari turns out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Calamari:</strong> Fresh calamari has a better texture and flavor compared to frozen. If you must use frozen calamari, make sure to thaw it completely and pat it dry before coating.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain the Right Oil Temperature:</strong> Keeping the oil at the correct temperature is crucial. If the oil is too hot, the calamari will burn; if it’s too cool, the calamari will absorb too much oil and become greasy.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flours:</strong> Different gluten-free flours can yield different textures and flavors. Don’t be afraid to experiment with rice flour, almond flour, or chickpea flour to find your favorite combination.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Immediately:</strong> Fried calamari is best enjoyed fresh and hot. Serve it immediately after frying to maintain its crispiness.</li>
    </ul>
