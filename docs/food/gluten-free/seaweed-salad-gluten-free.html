    <h1>Seaweed Salad: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>Seaweed salad is a vibrant, nutritious dish that has gained popularity worldwide, especially among health-conscious individuals and those following gluten-free diets. Packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, seaweed salad is not only a treat for your taste buds but also a boon for your health. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of seaweed salad, its gluten-free nature, and how you can incorporate it into your diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Seaweed Salad?</h2>
    <p>Seaweed salad is a traditional Japanese dish made from various types of edible seaweed, such as wakame, nori, and hijiki. These seaweeds are typically rehydrated, seasoned with a tangy dressing made from rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and sesame seeds, and then served chilled. The result is a refreshing, slightly salty, and umami-rich salad that pairs well with sushi, rice bowls, or as a standalone dish.</p>

    <h2>Why is Seaweed Salad Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Seaweed itself is naturally gluten-free, making it an excellent choice for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it’s essential to be cautious about the ingredients used in the dressing. Traditional seaweed salad dressings often contain soy sauce, which typically includes wheat. To ensure your seaweed salad is gluten-free, opt for gluten-free soy sauce or tamari, a wheat-free alternative.</p>
