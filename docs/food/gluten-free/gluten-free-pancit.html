    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Pancit</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free pancit is a straightforward process that involves stir-frying the ingredients together. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating this delicious dish:</p>

    <ol>

        <li><strong>Combine Ingredients:</strong> Add the cooked protein back into the pan, along with the cooked noodles. Pour in the gluten-free soy sauce or tamari and fish sauce, and toss everything together until well combined and heated through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Transfer the pancit to a serving dish and garnish with sliced green onions or a squeeze of calamansi (Filipino lime) for added flavor. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
