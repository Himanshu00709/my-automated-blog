<h2>Why Gluten-Free Pie?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular in recent years, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle.

<p>In NYC, the demand for gluten-free options has led to a surge in bakeries and restaurants offering gluten-free pies. These establishments use alternative flours such as almond, coconut, and rice flour to create pies that are both safe and delicious. Whether you're a lifelong gluten-free eater or just exploring the diet, you'll find plenty of options to satisfy your pie cravings in the city.</p>
