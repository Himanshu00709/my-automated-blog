    <h3>Potential Gluten Contamination Risks</h3>

    <p>While the core ingredients of arroz con leche are gluten-free, there are a few areas where gluten contamination can occur:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If the rice or other ingredients are processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing products, there’s a risk of cross-contamination. Always look for certified gluten-free labels if you have celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Additives and Flavorings:</strong> Some recipes call for additional ingredients like vanilla extract, condensed milk, or flavorings. These products may contain gluten or be processed in facilities that handle gluten. Always read labels carefully.</li>
        <li><strong>Thickeners:</strong> Some variations of arroz con leche use thickeners like flour or cornstarch. While cornstarch is gluten-free, flour is not. Be sure to check the recipe or ask about the ingredients if you’re dining out.</li>
    </ul>
