    <h1>Gluten-Free Mongolian Beef: A Delicious and Healthy Twist</h1>

    <p>Mongolian beef is a classic Chinese-American dish known for its savory, sweet, and slightly spicy flavors. Traditionally, it’s made with soy sauce, which contains gluten, making it off-limits for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, with a few simple swaps, you can enjoy a gluten-free version of this beloved dish without compromising on taste. In this blog post, we’ll explore how to make gluten-free Mongolian beef, its health benefits, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What is Mongolian Beef?</h2>

    <p>Mongolian beef is a stir-fry dish that typically consists of thinly sliced beef, green onions, and a rich, flavorful sauce.

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Mongolian Beef</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create a delicious gluten-free Mongolian beef dish:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Beef</h3>
    <p>Start by thinly slicing the beef against the grain. This ensures that the meat will be tender when cooked. Toss the beef slices in cornstarch until they are evenly coated. This will help create a crispy exterior when the beef is fried.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine the gluten-free soy sauce, brown sugar, minced garlic, grated ginger, and red pepper flakes (if using). Stir until the sugar is dissolved and the ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Beef</h3>
    <p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the beef slices in a single layer, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the beef is browned and crispy. Remove the beef from the pan and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine and Simmer</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the prepared sauce and bring it to a simmer. Return the beef to the pan and toss to coat it evenly in the sauce. Add the green onions and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the beef is fully cooked.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve</h3>
    <p>Serve the gluten-free Mongolian beef over steamed rice or gluten-free noodles. Garnish with additional green onions if desired.</p>
