<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>

<p>Start by making the gluten-free pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of gluten-free flour blend with 1/2 cup of cold butter (cut into small pieces). Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to blend the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add cold water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>

<p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the filling. In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add 2 cups of mixed vegetables and sauté until tender. Stir in 2 cups of cooked turkey, 2 cups of chicken or turkey broth, and 1 cup of milk. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble the Pie</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Place the bottom crust in a pie dish and trim the edges. Pour the turkey and vegetable filling into the crust. Roll out the remaining dough for the top crust, place it over the filling, and seal the edges. Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</p>

<h3>4. Bake the Pie</h3>

<p>Brush the top crust with an egg wash (1 beaten egg mixed with 1 tablespoon of water) to give it a golden, glossy finish. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Let the pie cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use store-bought gluten-free pie crust?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use a store-bought gluten-free pie crust if you’re short on time. Just make sure to check the ingredients to ensure it’s truly gluten-free and meets your dietary needs.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and use a dairy-free milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Leftover gluten-free turkey pot pie can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze the pie?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the pie either before or after baking. If freezing before baking, wrap the pie tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil. When ready to bake, thaw in the refrigerator overnight and bake as directed. If freezing after baking, let the pie cool completely, then wrap and freeze. Reheat in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until warmed through.</p>
