<p>As you can see, most of the core ingredients in artichoke dip are naturally gluten-free. However, the inclusion of breadcrumbs or certain processed ingredients can introduce gluten into the dish.</p>

<h2>Potential Sources of Gluten in Artichoke Dip</h2>

<p>While the basic ingredients of artichoke dip are gluten-free, there are a few areas where gluten can sneak in:</p>

    <li><strong>Breadcrumbs:</strong> Many recipes call for breadcrumbs to add texture. Traditional breadcrumbs are made from wheat and contain gluten. Opt for gluten-free breadcrumbs if needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Processed Cheese:</strong> Some pre-shredded cheeses contain anti-caking agents that may include gluten. Always check the label or use freshly grated cheese.</li>
    <li><strong>Mayonnaise and Condiments:</strong> While most mayonnaise is gluten-free, some brands may include additives or flavorings that contain gluten. Always read the label carefully.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If the dip is prepared in a kitchen where gluten-containing foods are also made, there’s a risk of cross-contamination. This is especially important for those with celiac disease.</li>
</ul>
