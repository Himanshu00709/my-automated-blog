    <h1>Arby's Gluten-Free Bun: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Fast-food chains have been quick to adapt, and Arby's is no exception.

Gluten is responsible for the elasticity and chewiness of traditional bread, but it can cause severe health issues for people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Gluten-free buns are made using alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca starch, which do not contain gluten.</p>

        <li>Potato starch</li>
        <li>Xanthan gum (a common gluten substitute)</li>

    <h2>How Does Arby's Gluten-Free Bun Taste?</h2>
