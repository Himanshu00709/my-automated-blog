    <h1>Biaggi's Gluten-Free: A Culinary Revolution</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free dining options has skyrocketed, driven by both medical necessity and lifestyle choices.

    <h2>The Rise of Gluten-Free Dining</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets were once a niche requirement, primarily for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. However, the landscape has changed dramatically. Today, millions of people choose gluten-free options for various reasons, including perceived health benefits, weight management, and even athletic performance. Biaggi's has recognized this shift and has crafted a menu that caters to this growing demographic without sacrificing the authentic Italian dining experience.</p>

    <h2>The Science Behind Gluten-Free Cooking</h2>
    <p>Creating gluten-free dishes that are both delicious and safe for those with gluten sensitivities is no small feat. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, is responsible for the elasticity and texture of traditional baked goods. Removing gluten requires a deep understanding of alternative ingredients and cooking techniques. Biaggi's chefs have mastered this art, using a combination of rice flour, almond flour, and other gluten-free substitutes to replicate the texture and flavor of traditional Italian dishes.</p>

    <h2>Why Biaggi's Stands Out</h2>
    <p>What sets Biaggi's apart from other restaurants offering gluten-free options is their dedication to authenticity and quality. Many establishments treat gluten-free dining as an afterthought, offering limited or uninspired choices. Biaggi's, on the other hand, has integrated gluten-free options seamlessly into their menu, ensuring that every guest, regardless of dietary restrictions, can enjoy a true Italian dining experience.</p>

        <p>While Biaggi's gluten-free menu is primarily focused on accommodating gluten sensitivities, there are several vegan-friendly options available. Be sure to inform your server of any dietary restrictions.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I order gluten-free dishes for takeout or delivery?</h3>
