<h1>Gluten-Free Fillo Dough: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Fillo dough, also known as phyllo dough, is a staple in many cuisines, particularly in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern dishes. Its thin, flaky layers are perfect for creating everything from savory pies to sweet pastries. However, for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, traditional fillo dough is off the table due to its wheat-based composition. Enter gluten-free fillo dough—a game-changer for gluten-free baking enthusiasts. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free fillo dough, from its ingredients to its uses, and even how to make it at home.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten-Free Fillo Dough?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free fillo dough is a variation of traditional fillo dough that eliminates gluten-containing ingredients like wheat flour. Instead, it uses a blend of gluten-free flours such as rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch to achieve a similar texture and functionality. The result is a dough that can be rolled out into thin sheets, layered, and baked to create the same flaky, delicate pastries that gluten-free eaters can enjoy without worry.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Gluten-Free Fillo Dough</h2>
