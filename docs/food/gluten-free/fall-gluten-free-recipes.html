<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fall Recipes</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use regular flour in these recipes?</h3>
    <p>No, these recipes are specifically designed to be gluten-free. Using regular flour would make them unsuitable for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Instead, use gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose blend.</p>

    <h3>2. Are these recipes suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>Some of these recipes can be easily adapted for a vegan diet. For example, you can use plant-based milk and butter in the muffins and pie, and omit the Parmesan in the risotto. Always check the ingredients to ensure they align with your dietary preferences.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make these recipes ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, many of these recipes can be prepared in advance. Soups and stews often taste even better the next day, and muffins can be stored in an airtight container for several days. The pumpkin pie can also be made a day ahead and refrigerated until ready to serve.</p>

    <h3>4. What are some good gluten-free substitutes for fall baking?</h3>
    <p>For fall baking, consider using almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. These flours work well in recipes like muffins, pies, and bread. You can also use gluten-free oats for added texture and flavor.</p>
