    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming sticky.</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized pot, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic, diced carrots, and celery to the pot. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the rinsed rice to the pot and stir to coat it with the oil and vegetables. Toast the rice for 1-2 minutes to enhance its flavor.</li>
        <li>Pour in the gluten-free broth and season with salt, pepper, and any optional herbs or spices. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the rice simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.</li>
    </ol>
