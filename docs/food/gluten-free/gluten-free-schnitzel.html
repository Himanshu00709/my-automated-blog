    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Schnitzel</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free schnitzel is a straightforward process that involves a few key steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Cutlets:</strong> Start by pounding the chicken or pork cutlets to an even thickness. This ensures that they cook evenly and remain tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the Cutlets:</strong> Season the cutlets with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Up a Breading Station:</strong> In three separate shallow dishes, place the gluten-free flour, beaten eggs, and gluten-free breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the Cutlets:</strong> Dredge each cutlet in the gluten-free flour, shaking off any excess. Then dip it into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off. Finally, coat the cutlet in the gluten-free breadcrumbs, pressing gently to ensure they adhere.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Schnitzel:</strong> Heat a generous amount of olive oil or butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the breaded cutlets and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Transfer the cooked schnitzel to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil. Serve immediately with your favorite sides, such as a fresh salad or roasted vegetables.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Schnitzel</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free schnitzel turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh gluten-free breadcrumbs and high-quality cutlets will make a significant difference in the final result.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overcrowd the Pan:</strong> Cook the schnitzel in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan, which can lead to uneven cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain the Right Temperature:</strong> Keep the oil at a consistent medium heat to prevent the schnitzel from burning or becoming greasy.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Coatings:</strong> Feel free to experiment with different gluten-free coatings, such as crushed gluten-free crackers or almond flour, for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>
