    <h1>Gluten-Free Thanksgiving: A Complete Guide to a Safe and Delicious Feast</h1>
    <p>Thanksgiving is a time for family, gratitude, and, of course, food. But for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, the holiday can be a source of stress. Navigating a traditional Thanksgiving meal while avoiding gluten can seem daunting, but with a little planning and creativity, you can enjoy a safe and delicious gluten-free feast. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to create a gluten-free Thanksgiving that everyone can enjoy.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Matters on Thanksgiving</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Even a small amount of gluten can trigger symptoms, so it's crucial to ensure that every dish on your Thanksgiving table is gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Planning Your Gluten-Free Thanksgiving Menu</h2>
    <p>Creating a gluten-free Thanksgiving menu doesn't mean sacrificing flavor or tradition. With a few substitutions and careful ingredient selection, you can enjoy all your favorite holiday dishes. Here’s a sample menu to get you started:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Course</th>
                <th>Dish</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Substitutions</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Appetizer</td>
                <td>Stuffed Mushrooms</td>
                <td>Use gluten-free breadcrumbs or almond flour for stuffing</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Main Course</td>
                <td>Roast Turkey</td>
                <td>Ensure the turkey is not pre-basted with gluten-containing ingredients</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Side Dish</td>
                <td>Mashed Potatoes</td>
                <td>Use gluten-free chicken broth and butter</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Side Dish</td>
                <td>Green Bean Casserole</td>
                <td>Use gluten-free cream of mushroom soup and fried onions</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Dessert</td>
                <td>Pumpkin Pie</td>
                <td>Use a gluten-free pie crust and check all spices for gluten</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Tips for a Safe Gluten-Free Thanksgiving</h2>
    <p>Ensuring a gluten-free Thanksgiving goes beyond just the menu. Here are some additional tips to keep in mind:</p>

    <h3>1. Communicate with Your Host or Guests</h3>
    <p>If you're attending a Thanksgiving dinner hosted by someone else, communicate your dietary needs in advance. Offer to bring a gluten-free dish to share, and ask about the ingredients used in other dishes to ensure they’re safe for you to eat.</p>

    <h3>2. Avoid Cross-Contamination</h3>
    <p>Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods or surfaces. Use separate utensils, cutting boards, and serving dishes for gluten-free items. Clean all surfaces thoroughly before preparing gluten-free foods.</p>

    <h3>3. Read Labels Carefully</h3>
    <p>Many packaged foods contain hidden sources of gluten. Always read labels carefully, and look for products that are certified gluten-free. Be cautious of ingredients like malt, modified food starch, and hydrolyzed vegetable protein, which can contain gluten.</p>

    <h3>4. Prepare in Advance</h3>
    <p>Preparing some dishes in advance can help reduce stress on Thanksgiving Day. Many gluten-free dishes, like casseroles and desserts, can be made ahead of time and reheated when needed.</p>
