    <h1>Gluten-Free Thanksgiving: A Complete Guide to a Safe and Delicious Feast</h1>
    <p>Thanksgiving is a time for family, gratitude, and, of course, food. But for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, the holiday can be a minefield of hidden gluten. The good news? With a little planning and creativity, you can enjoy a gluten-free Thanksgiving that’s just as delicious and satisfying as the traditional feast. In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know to create a safe and memorable gluten-free Thanksgiving meal.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Matters on Thanksgiving</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to fatigue and even long-term health complications. Thanksgiving, with its abundance of bread-based stuffing, gravies thickened with flour, and pies with traditional crusts, can be particularly challenging. But with the right approach, you can avoid gluten without sacrificing flavor or tradition.</p>

    <h2>Planning Your Gluten-Free Thanksgiving Menu</h2>
    <p>Creating a gluten-free Thanksgiving menu starts with understanding which traditional dishes contain gluten and how to adapt them. Here’s a breakdown of common Thanksgiving foods and their gluten-free alternatives:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Traditional Dish</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Alternative</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Stuffing</td>
                <td>Use gluten-free bread or cornbread for stuffing. Many stores now sell pre-made gluten-free stuffing mixes.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Gravy</td>
                <td>Thicken gravy with cornstarch or a gluten-free flour blend instead of regular flour.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pies</td>
                <td>Opt for gluten-free pie crusts, which are widely available, or make your own using almond flour or gluten-free flour blends.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Dinner Rolls</td>
                <td>Many brands now offer gluten-free dinner rolls, or you can make your own using gluten-free flour.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Green Bean Casserole</td>
                <td>Use gluten-free cream of mushroom soup and top with gluten-free fried onions.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
