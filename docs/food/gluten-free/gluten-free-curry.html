<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Curry at Home</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free curry at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating a delicious and safe gluten-free curry:</p>

<h3>1. Choose Gluten-Free Ingredients</h3>

<p>The first step in making gluten-free curry is to ensure that all your ingredients are free from gluten. This includes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Spices:</strong> Use pure, unadulterated spices. Some pre-packaged spice blends may contain gluten as a filler.</li>
    <li><strong>Broth:</strong> Opt for gluten-free vegetable or chicken broth. Check the label to ensure it’s certified gluten-free.</li>
    <li><strong>Thickening Agents:</strong> Instead of wheat flour, use gluten-free alternatives like cornstarch or rice flour to thicken your curry.</li>
    <li><strong>Proteins:</strong> Choose gluten-free proteins such as chicken, beef, tofu, or legumes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Prepare Your Base</h3>

<p>Start by sautéing onions, garlic, and ginger in a bit of oil until fragrant. Add your chosen spices, such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, and chili powder, and cook for a minute to release their flavors.</p>

<h3>3. Add Vegetables and Proteins</h3>

<p>Next, add your vegetables and proteins to the pot. Common choices include bell peppers, carrots, potatoes, and cauliflower. Stir everything together to coat the ingredients in the spice mixture.</p>

<h3>4. Simmer with Broth</h3>

<p>Pour in your gluten-free broth and bring the mixture to a simmer. Allow it to cook until the vegetables are tender and the proteins are fully cooked.</p>

<h3>5. Thicken the Curry</h3>

<p>If you prefer a thicker curry, mix a small amount of cornstarch or rice flour with water to create a slurry. Stir this into the curry and cook for a few more minutes until the desired consistency is reached.</p>

<h3>6. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Serve your gluten-free curry with rice, quinoa, or gluten-free naan bread. Garnish with fresh cilantro or a squeeze of lime for added flavor.</p>
