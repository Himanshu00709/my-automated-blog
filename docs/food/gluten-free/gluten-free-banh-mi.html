    <h1>Gluten-Free Banh Mi: A Delicious Twist on a Vietnamese Classic</h1>
    <p>Banh Mi, the iconic Vietnamese sandwich, is a harmonious blend of French and Vietnamese culinary traditions. Traditionally made with a baguette, it’s filled with a variety of ingredients like pickled vegetables, fresh herbs, and savory proteins. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this delicious sandwich can be a challenge. Enter the gluten-free Banh Mi—a delightful adaptation that allows everyone to savor this flavorful dish without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>The Origins of Banh Mi</h2>
    <p>The Banh Mi sandwich is a product of Vietnam's colonial history. During the French occupation, the baguette was introduced to Vietnam, and locals began incorporating it into their cuisine. Over time, the Banh Mi evolved into a unique fusion of French bread and Vietnamese flavors, featuring ingredients like cilantro, jalapeños, and pickled daikon and carrots. Today, it’s a beloved street food enjoyed worldwide.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Symptoms range from digestive issues to fatigue and skin problems. For these individuals, finding gluten-free alternatives to favorite foods is essential. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free baking has made it possible to recreate the Banh Mi experience without gluten.</p>

    <h2>Creating the Perfect Gluten-Free Banh Mi</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free Banh Mi involves two key components: the bread and the fillings. Let’s break it down step by step.</p>

    <h3>1. The Gluten-Free Baguette</h3>
    <p>The foundation of any Banh Mi is the bread. A good gluten-free baguette should have a crispy crust and a soft, airy interior. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Quantity</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Gluten-free flour blend</td>
                <td>2 cups</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Xanthan gum</td>
                <td>1 tsp</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Active dry yeast</td>
                <td>1 packet</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Warm water</td>
                <td>1 cup</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Olive oil</td>
                <td>2 tbsp</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>1 tsp</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Mix the ingredients, let the dough rise, and bake at 375°F for 20-25 minutes. The result is a gluten-free baguette that’s perfect for your Banh Mi.</p>

        <li>Protein options: grilled pork, chicken, tofu, or pâté</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise or a gluten-free alternative</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To assemble, slice the gluten-free baguette, spread a layer of mayonnaise, and layer your chosen fillings. The combination of textures and flavors is what makes the Banh Mi so special.</p>
