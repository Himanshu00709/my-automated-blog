    <h2>The History of Pasta Carbonara</h2>

    <p>Pasta Carbonara has a fascinating history, with its origins often debated among food historians. Some believe it was created by Italian coal miners (carbonai) who used simple ingredients like eggs, cheese, and cured pork to create a hearty meal. Others argue that it was influenced by American soldiers during World War II, who introduced bacon and eggs to Italian cuisine. Regardless of its origins, carbonara has become a staple in Italian cooking and continues to evolve with modern dietary needs, such as gluten-free options.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Pasta?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free pasta has gained popularity not only among those with gluten-related disorders but also among health-conscious individuals.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Gluten-Free Pasta</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gluten-free pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Be careful not to overcook, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Pancetta</h3>
    <p>While the pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or bacon and cook until crispy. Add the minced garlic and sauté for an additional minute. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Carbonara Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Parmesan cheese until well combined. Season with freshly ground black pepper.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Pasta and Sauce</h3>
    <p>Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss to coat the pasta in the rendered fat. Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture, stirring continuously to create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add reserved pasta water, one tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Divide the pasta among serving plates. Top with additional Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of black pepper. Serve immediately and enjoy your gluten-free pasta carbonara!</p>
