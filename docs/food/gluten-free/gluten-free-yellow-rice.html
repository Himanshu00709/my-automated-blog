    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Yellow Rice</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free yellow rice is a straightforward process that requires just a few simple ingredients. Here's a step-by-step guide to preparing this delightful dish:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of gluten-free rice (such as basmati or jasmine)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil or coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 cups of vegetable or chicken broth</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: 1 cup of mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, bell peppers)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming too sticky.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the olive oil or coconut oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and saut√© until they become translucent and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the turmeric powder to the pot and stir well to coat the onions and garlic. This will help release the flavor and color of the turmeric.</li>
        <li>Add the rinsed rice to the pot and stir to combine with the turmeric mixture. Cook for 1-2 minutes, allowing the rice to absorb the flavors.</li>
        <li>Pour in the vegetable or chicken broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the rice simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>If using mixed vegetables, add them to the pot during the last 5 minutes of cooking. This will ensure they are cooked but still retain their texture and color.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot as a side dish or as a base for your favorite protein.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Yellow Rice</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free yellow rice turns out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Rice:</strong> Opt for long-grain rice varieties like basmati or jasmine, as they tend to stay fluffy and separate when cooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Turmeric:</strong> If possible, use fresh turmeric root instead of powdered turmeric for a more vibrant color and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overcook:</strong> Be careful not to overcook the rice, as it can become mushy. Keep an eye on the cooking time and check the rice periodically.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to customize your yellow rice by adding ingredients like diced tomatoes, black beans, or even a splash of coconut milk for extra richness.</li>
    </ul>
