    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free fried ravioli is easier than you might think. Follow these steps for a perfect batch every time:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Ravioli</h3>
    <p>If you’re using pre-made gluten-free ravioli, ensure it’s thawed if frozen. If you’re making your own, prepare the dough and filling according to your recipe. Cook the ravioli in boiling water until just al dente, then drain and pat dry with a paper towel.</p>

    <h3>2. Set Up Your Breading Station</h3>
    <p>Create a breading station with three shallow bowls. In the first bowl, place gluten-free flour. In the second bowl, whisk together eggs with a splash of water. In the third bowl, place gluten-free breadcrumbs. You can season the breadcrumbs with Italian herbs, garlic powder, or Parmesan cheese for extra flavor.</p>

    <h3>3. Bread the Ravioli</h3>
    <p>Dredge each ravioli in the gluten-free flour, shaking off any excess. Dip it into the egg wash, ensuring it’s fully coated. Finally, press it into the breadcrumbs, making sure the entire surface is covered. Place the breaded ravioli on a plate or baking sheet.</p>

    <h3>4. Fry the Ravioli</h3>
    <p>Heat oil in a deep skillet or fryer to 350°F (175°C). Carefully place the breaded ravioli into the hot oil, frying in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry for 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy. Use a slotted spoon to remove the ravioli and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</p>

    <h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve the gluten-free fried ravioli hot with a side of marinara sauce for dipping. Garnish with fresh basil or grated Parmesan cheese for an extra touch of flavor.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Fried Ravioli</h2>
    <p>Here are some expert tips to ensure your gluten-free fried ravioli turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a thermometer:</strong> Maintaining the correct oil temperature is crucial. Too hot, and the ravioli will burn; too cool, and they’ll absorb too much oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t skip the drying step:</strong> Patting the ravioli dry after boiling ensures the breading adheres properly.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with fillings:</strong> Try different fillings like spinach and ricotta, butternut squash, or even a meat-based filling for variety.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake for a healthier option:</strong> If you prefer not to fry, you can bake the breaded ravioli at 400°F (200°C) for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li>
    </ul>
