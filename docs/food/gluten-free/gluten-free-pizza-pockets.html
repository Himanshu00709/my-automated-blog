    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. Add the olive oil and warm water, and mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough gently until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Divide the dough into equal portions and roll each portion into a circle about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Fillings:</strong> Spoon a small amount of tomato sauce onto one half of each dough circle. Add shredded mozzarella cheese and your favorite toppings on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold and Seal:</strong> Fold the other half of the dough over the fillings to create a half-moon shape. Use a fork to press and seal the edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the pizza pockets on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the pockets are golden brown and the cheese is melted.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the pizza pockets to cool slightly before serving. They can be enjoyed immediately or stored in the freezer for later use.</li>
