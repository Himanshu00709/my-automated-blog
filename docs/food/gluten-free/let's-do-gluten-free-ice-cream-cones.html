    <h1>Let's Do Gluten-Free Ice Cream Cones</h1>
    <p>Ice cream cones are a classic treat that many of us have enjoyed since childhood. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional ice cream cones can be off-limits due to the presence of gluten. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free alternatives has made it possible for everyone to enjoy this delightful treat without compromising their health. In this blog post, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free ice cream cones, from their ingredients to their benefits, and even how you can make your own at home.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Ice Cream Cones?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free ice cream cones are made without any ingredients that contain gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. These cones are designed to provide the same crispy, sweet experience as traditional cones but are safe for those who need to avoid gluten. They are typically made from alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or coconut flour, and are often sweetened with natural sugars like honey or maple syrup.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Ice Cream Cones</h2>

        <li><strong>Digestive Health:</strong> Even for those without celiac disease, gluten can sometimes cause digestive discomfort. Gluten-free cones are easier on the stomach for many people.</li>
