    <h1>Easy Gluten-Free Monkey Bread: A Delicious Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Monkey bread is a classic pull-apart dessert that’s perfect for sharing. Traditionally made with gluten-containing dough, this recipe has been adapted to be completely gluten-free, ensuring that everyone can enjoy this gooey, sweet treat. Whether you’re new to gluten-free baking or a seasoned pro, this easy gluten-free monkey bread recipe is sure to become a favorite in your household.</p>

    <h2>What is Monkey Bread?</h2>
    <p>Monkey bread is a sweet, sticky pastry made by rolling pieces of dough in cinnamon sugar, stacking them in a bundt pan, and baking them to perfection. The result is a pull-apart bread that’s perfect for breakfast, brunch, or dessert. The name "monkey bread" comes from the way it’s eaten—pulling apart the pieces with your fingers, much like a monkey would.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, avoiding gluten is essential for maintaining good health. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems for those who are intolerant. Fortunately, gluten-free baking has come a long way, and with the right ingredients, you can create delicious baked goods that are just as satisfying as their gluten-containing counterparts.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum (if needed), granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure all the dry ingredients are evenly distributed. Add the melted butter, milk, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Stir until a soft dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour, one tablespoon at a time, until it’s manageable.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Shape the Dough</h3>
    <p>Divide the dough into small, bite-sized pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, about 1 inch in diameter. You should have around 40-50 dough balls.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Coat the Dough Balls</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar and cinnamon. Melt the additional 1/2 cup of butter in another bowl. Dip each dough ball into the melted butter, then roll it in the cinnamon-sugar mixture until fully coated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Monkey Bread</h3>
    <p>Grease a bundt pan thoroughly with butter or non-stick spray. Place the coated dough balls into the pan, layering them evenly. Make sure to pack them tightly, as they will expand during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the monkey bread for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the dough is cooked through. Let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before inverting it onto a serving plate.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make this recipe dairy-free by using a non-dairy milk (such as almond or oat milk) and a dairy-free butter substitute.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>This recipe is designed for gluten-free all-purpose flour. If you use a different type of flour, the texture and consistency may vary. Be sure to check if your flour blend includes xanthan gum, as this is essential for binding the dough.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store leftover monkey bread?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. You can also refrigerate it for up to 5 days. To reheat, simply microwave individual portions for 10-15 seconds or warm in the oven at 300°F (150°C) for 5-10 minutes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free monkey bread is a delightful treat that’s easy to make and perfect for sharing. With its gooey, cinnamon-sugar coating and soft, pull-apart texture, it’s a dessert that’s sure to please everyone at the table.
