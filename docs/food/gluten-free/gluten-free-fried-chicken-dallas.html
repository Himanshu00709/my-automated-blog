    <h1>Gluten-Free Fried Chicken in Dallas: A Guide to the Best Spots</h1>
    <p>Fried chicken is a beloved comfort food, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a safe and delicious option can be a challenge. Fortunately, Dallas has embraced the gluten-free movement, and several restaurants now offer gluten-free fried chicken that doesn’t compromise on flavor or texture. In this guide, we’ll explore the best spots in Dallas to enjoy gluten-free fried chicken, along with tips for ensuring a safe dining experience.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Fried Chicken?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe health issues for these individuals. Traditional fried chicken is coated in flour, which contains gluten, making it off-limits for those who need to avoid it. However, with the rise of gluten-free alternatives, restaurants have started using gluten-free flours like rice flour, almond flour, or cornmeal to create crispy, flavorful fried chicken that everyone can enjoy.</p>

    <h2>Top Spots for Gluten-Free Fried Chicken in Dallas</h2>
