    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by making the gluten-free crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and salt. Add the cold butter cubes and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has chilled, roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking) into a circle about 1/4 inch thick. Carefully transfer the dough to a tart pan, pressing it gently into the edges. Trim any excess dough and prick the bottom with a fork to prevent air bubbles during baking.</p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Tomato Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the tomato filling. Slice the tomatoes into thin rounds and set them aside. In a small bowl, mix the minced garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Brush this mixture over the bottom of the tart crust to add flavor. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the crust, followed by the chopped basil leaves. Arrange the tomato slices in a single layer on top of the cheese and basil.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Tart</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the tart in the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Remove the tart from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Tomato Tart</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right combination of flours and starches to mimic the texture of traditional wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep the Butter Cold:</strong> Cold butter is key to achieving a flaky crust. Make sure your butter is well-chilled before incorporating it into the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overwork the Dough:</strong> Overworking the dough can lead to a tough crust. Mix the dough just until it comes together, and handle it as little as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh, ripe tomatoes and herbs will give your tart the best flavor. If possible, use tomatoes that are in season for the best results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make the tart crust ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the gluten-free tart crust ahead of time. Simply wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for up to 2 days, or freeze it for up to a month. When you’re ready to use it, let it thaw in the refrigerator before rolling it out.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While mozzarella is a classic choice for tomato tarts, you can experiment with other cheeses like goat cheese, feta, or even a sharp cheddar for a different flavor profile.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Is this tart suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can be adapted for vegans by using a vegan butter substitute for the crust and a plant-based cheese alternative. Make sure to check that all ingredients are vegan-friendly.</p>
    </div>
