    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Gluten-Free Spaghetti</h3>
    <p>Start by cooking the gluten-free spaghetti according to the package instructions. Be careful not to overcook it, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy if left in boiling water for too long. Once cooked, drain the pasta and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, and sauté until the onion is translucent. If you’re using ground beef or turkey, add it to the skillet and cook until browned. Drain any excess fat, then stir in the marinara sauce and Italian seasoning. Let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Pasta and Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked gluten-free spaghetti with the sauce. Toss until the pasta is evenly coated. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer the pasta mixture to a greased baking dish. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese evenly over the top. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the baked spaghetti is done, let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired, and enjoy your gluten-free comfort food!</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free pasta?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any type of gluten-free pasta you prefer. Just be sure to follow the cooking instructions on the package, as cooking times may vary depending on the type of pasta.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish vegetarian?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply omit the ground beef or turkey and add more vegetables like zucchini, mushrooms, or bell peppers to the sauce for added flavor and texture.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftover gluten-free baked spaghetti can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free baked spaghetti?</h3>
