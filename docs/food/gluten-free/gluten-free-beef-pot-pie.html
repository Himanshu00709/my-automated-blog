    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Beef Pot Pie</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free beef pot pie. This recipe serves 4-6 people and takes approximately 1.5 hours to prepare and cook.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by browning 1 pound of beef stew meat in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the meat is browned, remove it from the skillet and set it aside. In the same skillet, sauté 1 diced onion, 2 minced garlic cloves, and 2 diced carrots until they begin to soften. Add 1 cup of frozen peas and 1 cup of diced potatoes to the skillet, along with the browned beef. Pour in 2 cups of gluten-free beef broth and 1 tablespoon of gluten-free Worcestershire sauce. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Thicken the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of cold water to create a slurry. Slowly stir the slurry into the beef mixture, allowing it to thicken. Continue to simmer the filling for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>While the filling is simmering, prepare your gluten-free pie crust. If you’re using a store-bought crust, simply roll it out according to the package instructions. If you’re making your own crust, combine 2 cups of gluten-free flour blend with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 cup of cold, cubed butter. Use a pastry cutter or your hands to mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add 4-6 tablespoons of ice water, mixing until the dough comes together. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to fit your pie dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Pour the beef filling into a 9-inch pie dish. Carefully place the rolled-out pie crust over the filling, trimming any excess dough and crimping the edges to seal. Cut a few small slits in the top of the crust to allow steam to escape. Brush the crust with an egg wash (1 beaten egg mixed with 1 tablespoon of water) for a golden finish. Bake the pot pie for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</p>
