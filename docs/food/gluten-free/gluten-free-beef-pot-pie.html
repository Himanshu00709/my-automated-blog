    <h1>Gluten-Free Beef Pot Pie: A Comfort Food Classic</h1>
    <p>When it comes to comfort food, few dishes can rival the hearty and satisfying nature of a beef pot pie.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by making the gluten-free crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and cold butter. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Cook the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the filling. In a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown the beef stew meat over medium-high heat. Once the meat is browned, remove it from the skillet and set it aside. In the same skillet, sauté the onion, carrots, celery, and potatoes until they begin to soften. Return the beef to the skillet and add the beef broth. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.</p>

    <h3>3. Thicken the Gravy</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with a little water to create a slurry. Stir the slurry into the beef and vegetable mixture, and continue to cook until the gravy thickens. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) to fit the top of your pie dish. Pour the beef filling into the dish and cover it with the rolled-out dough. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges to seal. Cut a few small slits in the top of the crust to allow steam to escape. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a store-bought gluten-free crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can certainly use a store-bought gluten-free crust if you’re short on time. Just make sure to check the ingredients to ensure it meets your dietary needs.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the filling and crust separately a day in advance. When you’re ready to bake, simply assemble the pie and pop it in the oven.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of cornstarch to thicken the gravy?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use cornstarch, you can use arrowroot powder or tapioca starch as a gluten-free alternative.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free beef pot pie?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the assembled but unbaked pie. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, and it can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. When ready to bake, simply place it in the oven straight from the freezer, adding an extra 10-15 minutes to the baking time.</p>
