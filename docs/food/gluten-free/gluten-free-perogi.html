    <h1>Gluten-Free Pierogi: A Delicious Twist on a Classic Dish</h1>

    <p>Pierogi, the beloved Eastern European dumplings, have been a staple in many households for generations. Traditionally made with wheat flour, these delightful pockets of dough are filled with a variety of ingredients, from mashed potatoes and cheese to sauerkraut and mushrooms. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying pierogi can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free pierogi—a delicious and inclusive twist on this classic dish that allows everyone to savor its comforting flavors.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Pierogi?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free pierogi are made using alternative flours that do not contain gluten, such as rice flour, almond flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. The dough is carefully crafted to mimic the texture and elasticity of traditional pierogi dough, ensuring that the final product is just as satisfying. The fillings remain largely the same, offering a wide range of options to suit different tastes and dietary needs.</p>

Gluten-free pierogi provide a safe and delicious alternative, allowing those with dietary restrictions to enjoy this beloved dish without worry. Additionally, gluten-free pierogi can be a healthier option for anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake, as they often contain more nutrient-dense ingredients like almond or coconut flour.</p>

            <td>As needed</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg and water. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Roll the dough out to about 1/8-inch thickness. Use a round cookie cutter or glass to cut out circles of dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Filling:</strong> Place a small spoonful of your chosen filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, then press the edges together to seal. You can use a fork to crimp the edges for a decorative touch.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pierogi:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully drop the pierogi into the boiling water and cook until they float to the surface, about 3-4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and serve immediately, or pan-fry in butter for a crispy finish.</li>
