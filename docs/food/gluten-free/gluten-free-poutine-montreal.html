<h1>Gluten-Free Poutine in Montreal: A Culinary Adventure</h1>

<p>Montreal, the cultural and culinary heart of Quebec, is renowned for its vibrant food scene. Among its many iconic dishes, poutine stands out as a quintessential Canadian comfort food. Traditionally made with fries, cheese curds, and gravy, poutine has become a beloved dish worldwide. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic dish can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free poutine—a delicious and inclusive twist on the traditional recipe. In this article, we’ll explore the best places to find gluten-free poutine in Montreal, the ingredients that make it special, and why this dish is a must-try for anyone visiting the city.</p>

<h2>What Makes Poutine Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Traditional poutine is typically made with three main components: fries, cheese curds, and gravy. The gluten-free version of this dish requires careful attention to each of these elements. Here’s a breakdown of what makes poutine gluten-free:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Component</th>
            <th>Gluten-Free Considerations</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Fries</td>
            <td>Fries are naturally gluten-free, but cross-contamination can occur if they are fried in the same oil as gluten-containing foods. Ensure the fries are cooked in a dedicated fryer.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cheese Curds</td>
            <td>Cheese curds are typically gluten-free, but it’s important to check for any added ingredients or coatings that may contain gluten.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Gravy</td>
            <td>Traditional gravy is often made with flour as a thickening agent, which contains gluten. Gluten-free gravy uses alternatives like cornstarch or gluten-free flour blends.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
