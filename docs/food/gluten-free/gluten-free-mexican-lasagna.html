    <h1>Gluten-Free Mexican Lasagna: A Flavorful Twist on a Classic</h1>
    <p>When it comes to comfort food, lasagna is a timeless favorite. But what if you could combine the comforting layers of lasagna with the bold, vibrant flavors of Mexican cuisine?

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by heating the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic, sautéing until fragrant and translucent. Next, add the ground beef or turkey, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Once the meat is browned, stir in the black beans, corn, diced tomatoes, and spices. Let the mixture simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of enchilada sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of gluten-free corn tortillas over the sauce, followed by a layer of the meat mixture. Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded cheese on top. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of tortillas and a final topping of cheese.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. After 25 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown. Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>
    <p>This Gluten-Free Mexican Lasagna is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. The use of corn tortillas provides a good source of fiber, while the black beans and ground meat offer a healthy dose of protein. The vegetables, such as corn and tomatoes, add essential vitamins and minerals, making this dish a well-rounded meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this dish vegetarian?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the ground meat with a plant-based alternative, such as crumbled tofu or a meat substitute like Beyond Meat. You can also add more vegetables, like zucchini or bell peppers, to bulk up the filling.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use store-bought enchilada sauce?</h3>
        <p>Yes, store-bought enchilada sauce works perfectly fine. However, if you prefer a homemade version, you can easily make your own by blending tomatoes, chili powder, garlic, and a bit of broth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply place a portion in the microwave or oven until warmed through.</p>
