<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Matzo</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free matzo at home is a rewarding process that allows you to control the quality of ingredients and ensure that the final product meets your dietary needs. Here’s a step-by-step guide to making gluten-free matzo:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine almond flour, coconut flour, tapioca flour, potato starch, and xanthan gum. Whisk until well blended.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add water and olive oil to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. The dough should be firm but pliable.</li>
    <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and roll it out thinly, about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
    <li><strong>Prick the Dough:</strong> Use a fork to prick the dough all over, which helps prevent it from puffing up during baking.</li>
