    <h1>Gluten-Free Vasilopita: A Delicious Tradition for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Vasilopita, a traditional Greek New Year's cake, is a beloved treat that symbolizes good luck and prosperity for the coming year. Traditionally made with wheat flour, this cake has been a staple in Greek households for centuries. However, with the rise of gluten intolerance and celiac disease, many people are seeking gluten-free alternatives to enjoy this festive dessert. In this article, we’ll explore the history of Vasilopita, the benefits of a gluten-free version, and provide a detailed recipe to help you create your own gluten-free Vasilopita at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Vasilopita</h2>
    <p>Vasilopita is deeply rooted in Greek culture and tradition. The cake is named after Saint Basil the Great, a 4th-century bishop who was known for his generosity and care for the poor. According to legend, Saint Basil wanted to distribute money to the poor without causing embarrassment. He baked coins into bread and distributed it, ensuring that everyone received a piece. Today, the tradition continues with a coin or trinket baked into the Vasilopita, and the person who finds it is said to receive good luck for the year.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not only for those with celiac disease but also for individuals with gluten sensitivity or those looking to improve their overall health. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems for some people. By opting for a gluten-free Vasilopita, you can enjoy this traditional dessert without compromising your health or dietary needs.</p>
