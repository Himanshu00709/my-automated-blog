    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Roast the Poblano Peppers</h3>
    <p>Start by roasting the poblano peppers. You can do this over an open flame on your stovetop or under the broiler in your oven. Turn the peppers occasionally until the skin is blistered and charred on all sides. Once roasted, place the peppers in a bowl and cover them with plastic wrap to steam for about 10 minutes. This will make it easier to peel off the skin.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Cheese Filling</h3>
    <p>While the peppers are steaming, prepare the cheese filling. Shred the Oaxaca or Monterey Jack cheese and set it aside. Once the peppers have cooled, carefully peel off the skin, make a small slit in each pepper, and remove the seeds. Be careful not to tear the peppers. Stuff each pepper with the shredded cheese, ensuring they are well-filled but not overstuffed.</p>

    <h3>3. Make the Gluten-Free Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, separate the egg whites from the yolks. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. In a separate bowl, lightly beat the egg yolks. Gently fold the yolks into the beaten egg whites to create a light and airy batter. This will serve as the coating for your chili rellenos.</p>

    <h3>4. Coat and Fry the Peppers</h3>
    <p>Heat the oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Lightly coat each stuffed pepper with gluten-free flour, then dip them into the egg batter, ensuring they are fully coated. Carefully place the peppers in the hot oil and fry until golden brown on all sides, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove the peppers from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</p>

    <h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve your gluten-free chili rellenos hot, accompanied by your favorite toppings such as salsa, guacamole, or sour cream. They pair wonderfully with a side of Mexican rice or a fresh salad.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of pepper?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other types of peppers such as Anaheim or bell peppers, but keep in mind that the flavor and heat level will vary. Poblano peppers are traditionally used for their mild heat and robust flavor.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of cheese for a vegan version?</h3>
        <p>For a vegan version, you can use plant-based cheese or a mixture of cooked quinoa, black beans, and spices as a filling. The batter can be made using a flaxseed or chia seed egg substitute.</p>

        <h3>Can I bake the chili rellenos instead of frying?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake the chili rellenos for a healthier option. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C), place the coated peppers on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and bake for 20-25 minutes, turning halfway through, until golden brown.</p>
    </div>

By using gluten-free flour and fresh, high-quality ingredients, you can create a dish that is not only safe for those with gluten sensitivities but also incredibly flavorful and satisfying.
