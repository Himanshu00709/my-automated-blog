    </table>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Set your oven to 425°F (220°C) and allow it to preheat while you prepare the potatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the potatoes:</strong> Wash and scrub the potatoes thoroughly. You can peel them if desired, but leaving the skin on adds extra texture and nutrients. Cut the potatoes into evenly sized pieces, about 1 to 1.5 inches in size.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the potatoes:</strong> In a large bowl, toss the potato pieces with olive oil, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and fresh rosemary (if using). Ensure the potatoes are evenly coated with the seasoning.</li>
        <li><strong>Arrange on a baking sheet:</strong> Spread the potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Avoid overcrowding to ensure even roasting.</li>
        <li><strong>Roast the potatoes:</strong> Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and roast for 25-30 minutes, flipping the potatoes halfway through. The potatoes should be golden brown and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and enjoy:</strong> Remove the potatoes from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving. Pair them with your favorite main dish or enjoy them on their own!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Roasted Potatoes</h2>

    <p>To achieve the best results, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the right potatoes:</strong> Yukon Gold and Russet potatoes are ideal for roasting due to their starchy texture, which helps create a crispy exterior.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut evenly:</strong> Cutting the potatoes into uniform sizes ensures they cook evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overcrowd the pan:</strong> Overcrowding can lead to steaming instead of roasting, resulting in soggy potatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Use high heat:</strong> Roasting at a high temperature (425°F or higher) helps achieve a crispy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with seasonings:</strong> Feel free to customize the seasonings to suit your taste. Try adding thyme, oregano, or even a dash of cayenne pepper for a spicy kick.</li>
    </ul>
