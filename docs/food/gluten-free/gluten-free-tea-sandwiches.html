    <h1>Gluten-Free Tea Sandwiches: A Delightful Guide</h1>
    <p>Tea sandwiches are a quintessential part of any afternoon tea, offering a delicate and refined touch to the experience. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying these dainty treats can sometimes be a challenge. However, with the right ingredients and a bit of creativity, gluten-free tea sandwiches can be just as delicious and elegant as their traditional counterparts. In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about crafting the perfect gluten-free tea sandwiches, from selecting the right bread to creating flavorful fillings.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Tea Sandwiches?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle. Gluten-free tea sandwiches are a wonderful way to cater to these dietary needs without compromising on taste or presentation. Whether you’re hosting a tea party or simply enjoying a quiet afternoon, these sandwiches can be a delightful addition to your menu.</p>

    <h2>Choosing the Right Gluten-Free Bread</h2>
    <p>The foundation of any great tea sandwich is the bread. When it comes to gluten-free options, there are several types of bread to consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free White Bread:</strong> A classic choice that closely resembles traditional white bread in texture and taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Whole Grain Bread:</strong> Offers a nuttier flavor and is packed with nutrients, making it a healthier option.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Sourdough:</strong> Known for its tangy flavor and chewy texture, sourdough can add a unique twist to your sandwiches.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Flatbreads or Wraps:</strong> Perfect for creating open-faced sandwiches or roll-ups.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When selecting gluten-free bread, it’s important to look for brands that are certified gluten-free to avoid cross-contamination. Additionally, consider the texture and moisture content of the bread, as gluten-free bread can sometimes be drier or crumblier than traditional bread.</p>

    <h2>Delicious Gluten-Free Tea Sandwich Fillings</h2>
    <p>The filling is where you can truly get creative with your gluten-free tea sandwiches. Here are some classic and innovative options to consider:</p>

        <li><strong>Serve Immediately:</strong> Gluten-free bread can dry out quickly, so it’s best to assemble your sandwiches just before serving.</li>
