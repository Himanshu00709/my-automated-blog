    <h1>Five Guys Gluten-Free Fries: A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>When it comes to fast food, Five Guys has carved out a niche for itself with its delicious burgers and fries. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Five Guys fries are gluten-free is a crucial one. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the world of Five Guys gluten-free fries, exploring their preparation, ingredients, and how they fit into a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>Are Five Guys Fries Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, Five Guys fries are gluten-free. The fries are made from fresh, hand-cut potatoes and are cooked in 100% peanut oil, which is naturally gluten-free. Five Guys takes pride in their commitment to quality and transparency, and they have made it clear that their fries do not contain any gluten ingredients. However, it’s important to note that while the fries themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur in the kitchen, especially if the same fryer is used for other gluten-containing items.</p>

    <h2>How Five Guys Prepares Their Fries</h2>

    <p>Five Guys is known for its meticulous preparation process. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how their fries are made:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Step</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1. Potato Selection</td>
                <td>Five Guys uses only fresh, high-quality potatoes. They are hand-selected to ensure consistency and flavor.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2. Hand-Cutting</td>
                <td>The potatoes are hand-cut in-store daily. This ensures that the fries are fresh and have a homemade taste.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3. Soaking</td>
                <td>The cut potatoes are soaked in water to remove excess starch, which helps achieve the perfect crispiness.</td>
