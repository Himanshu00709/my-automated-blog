    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free Oreo crust is a straightforward process that requires minimal effort. Here's how to do it:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Cookies:</strong> Start by placing the gluten-free chocolate sandwich cookies in a food processor. Pulse until the cookies are finely ground into crumbs. If you don't have a food processor, you can place the cookies in a zip-top bag and crush them with a rolling pin.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine with Butter:</strong> Transfer the cookie crumbs to a mixing bowl and add the melted butter. Mix until the crumbs are evenly coated and the mixture resembles wet sand.</li>
        <li><strong>Press into Pan:</strong> Pour the mixture into a 9-inch pie dish or springform pan. Use the back of a spoon or your fingers to press the crumbs firmly into the bottom and up the sides of the pan, creating an even layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill:</strong> Place the crust in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to set. This will help the crust hold together when you add your filling.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Oreo Crust</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free Oreo crust turns out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Cookies:</strong> Not all gluten-free cookies are created equal. Choose a brand that closely mimics the taste and texture of traditional Oreos for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overprocess:</strong> When grinding the cookies, be careful not to overprocess them. You want fine crumbs, not a powdery consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Press Firmly:</strong> When pressing the crumbs into the pan, make sure to apply even pressure. This will help the crust hold together and prevent it from crumbling when sliced.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill Thoroughly:</strong> Allowing the crust to chill in the refrigerator is crucial. This step ensures that the butter solidifies, giving the crust its structure.</li>
    </ul>
