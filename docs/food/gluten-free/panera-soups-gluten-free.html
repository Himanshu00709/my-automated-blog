<h1>Panera Soups: A Gluten-Free Guide</h1>

<p>Panera Bread is a popular fast-casual restaurant chain known for its fresh, wholesome ingredients and a wide variety of menu options. For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, navigating restaurant menus can be challenging. However, Panera has made strides in offering gluten-free options, particularly in their soup selections. In this article, we’ll explore Panera’s gluten-free soups, their ingredients, and how to enjoy them safely.</p>

For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. A gluten-free diet eliminates all sources of gluten, which requires careful attention to food labels and restaurant menus.</p>
