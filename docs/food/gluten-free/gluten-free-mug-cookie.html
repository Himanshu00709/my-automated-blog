    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free mug cookie is incredibly simple. Follow these steps for a perfect treat:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a microwave-safe mug, combine the gluten-free flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir until well mixed.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the wet ingredients:</strong> Pour in the melted butter (or coconut oil), milk, and vanilla extract. Stir until the mixture forms a thick batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Add chocolate chips:</strong> Fold in the chocolate chips, ensuring they’re evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Microwave:</strong> Place the mug in the microwave and cook on high for 45-60 seconds. Keep an eye on it to avoid overcooking—the cookie should be soft and slightly gooey in the center.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Let the mug cookie cool for a minute or two before digging in. Top with a scoop of ice cream or a drizzle of caramel sauce for an extra treat!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Best Gluten-Free Mug Cookie</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free mug cookie turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use the right flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Almond flour and oat flour work particularly well in this recipe, but you can experiment with other blends.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cookie. Stir just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust cooking time:</strong> Microwave wattages vary, so you may need to adjust the cooking time. Start with 45 seconds and add 10-second increments if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize your cookie:</strong> Feel free to add nuts, dried fruit, or even a sprinkle of cinnamon to make the recipe your own.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Mug Cookies</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with coconut oil and use a plant-based milk like almond or oat milk. Ensure your chocolate chips are dairy-free as well.</p>

        <h3>Can I bake this in the oven instead of the microwave?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can! Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and bake the mug cookie in an oven-safe ramekin for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Mug cookies are best enjoyed fresh, but if you have leftovers, cover the mug with plastic wrap and store it in the fridge for up to 2 days. Reheat in the microwave for 10-15 seconds before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I double the recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can double the ingredients to make a larger cookie. Just be sure to use a larger mug and increase the cooking time by 15-20 seconds.</p>
    </div>
