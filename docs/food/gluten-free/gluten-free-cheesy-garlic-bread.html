<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free cheesy garlic bread is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a dish that’s sure to impress:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your bread will cook evenly and develop a golden, crispy crust.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Garlic Butter</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, combine the softened butter and minced garlic. Mix well until the garlic is evenly distributed throughout the butter. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste, along with the Italian seasoning if you’re using it.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Slice the Bread</h3>
<p>Slice your gluten-free bread into thick slices, about 1 inch in width. Be careful not to slice it too thin, as gluten-free bread can be more delicate than regular bread.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Spread the Garlic Butter</h3>
<p>Generously spread the garlic butter mixture onto each slice of bread. Make sure to cover the entire surface, as this will ensure that every bite is packed with flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Add the Cheese</h3>
<p>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese over the buttered bread slices. Be generous with the cheese—this is what makes the bread irresistibly cheesy!</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
<p>Place the bread slices on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the edges of the bread are golden brown.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Pair it with your favorite pasta dish, soup, or enjoy it on its own as a tasty snack.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Cheesy Garlic Bread</h2>

<p>While cheesy garlic bread is often considered a treat, making it gluten-free can offer some nutritional benefits. Gluten-free bread is typically made from alternative flours like almond, coconut, or rice flour, which can be lower in calories and higher in fiber compared to traditional wheat bread. Additionally, garlic is known for its health benefits, including its ability to boost the immune system and reduce inflammation.</p>

<p>Cheese, while high in fat, is also a good source of protein and calcium. When consumed in moderation, it can be part of a balanced diet. By choosing high-quality ingredients and controlling portion sizes, you can enjoy gluten-free cheesy garlic bread without guilt.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use any type of gluten-free bread?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use any type of gluten-free bread, but it’s best to choose a high-quality brand that has a good texture and flavor. Some gluten-free breads can be dry or crumbly, so look for one that’s soft and slightly chewy.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like margarine or olive oil, and use dairy-free cheese. Just make sure to choose a cheese that melts well for the best results.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>If you have any leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. To reheat, place the bread in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 5-7 minutes, or until warmed through.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free cheesy garlic bread?</h3>
