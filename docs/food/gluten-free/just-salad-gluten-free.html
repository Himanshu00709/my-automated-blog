    <h1>Just Salad Gluten-Free Options: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by an increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the desire for healthier eating habits. Just Salad, a popular fast-casual restaurant chain, has responded to this demand by offering a variety of gluten-free options. Whether you're a seasoned gluten-free eater or just starting your journey, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know about Just Salad's gluten-free offerings.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Even for those without gluten-related health issues, many people choose gluten-free diets for their potential health benefits, such as improved digestion and reduced inflammation.</p>

    <h2>Just Salad's Commitment to Gluten-Free Options</h2>
    <p>Just Salad has made a concerted effort to cater to gluten-free customers. Their menu includes a variety of salads, bowls, and wraps that are either naturally gluten-free or can be customized to be gluten-free. The restaurant also takes precautions to minimize cross-contamination, making it a safer choice for those with severe gluten sensitivities.</p>
