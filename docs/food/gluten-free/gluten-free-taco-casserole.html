<h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>

<p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the process of making a gluten-free taco casserole:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with a little oil or cooking spray to prevent sticking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Cook the Meat</h3>
<p>In a large skillet, cook your ground beef or turkey over medium heat until browned. Drain any excess fat, then add your gluten-free taco seasoning and a splash of water. Stir well and let it simmer for a few minutes to absorb the flavors.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Layer the Casserole</h3>
<p>Begin by spreading a layer of crushed gluten-free tortilla chips at the bottom of the baking dish. Next, add a layer of the cooked meat mixture, followed by a layer of black beans or refried beans. Top with a generous amount of salsa or diced tomatoes, and then sprinkle with cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of cheese on top.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Place the casserole in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. For an extra golden top, you can broil the casserole for the last 2-3 minutes.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Remove the casserole from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh cilantro, avocado slices, or a dollop of sour cream if desired. Serve warm and enjoy!</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Taco Casserole</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I make this casserole dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the cheese with a dairy-free alternative, such as vegan cheese or nutritional yeast. You can also skip the cheese altogether and rely on the other flavorful ingredients to carry the dish.</p>

    <h3>2. How do I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply microwave individual portions or warm the entire casserole in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until heated through.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I freeze this casserole?</h3>
    <p>Yes, this casserole freezes well. Assemble the casserole as directed, but instead of baking, cover it tightly with aluminum foil and freeze. When ready to eat, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and bake as usual.</p>

    <h3>4. What can I use instead of tortilla chips?</h3>
    <p>If you don’t have tortilla chips, you can use gluten-free corn tortillas cut into strips or even gluten-free breadcrumbs for a different texture.</p>
