    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> In a food processor, combine the gluten-free flour and cold butter. Pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a mini muffin tin.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to about 1/8-inch thickness. Use a round cutter to cut out circles that fit your mini muffin tin. Press the dough circles into the tin, ensuring they cover the bottom and sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, heavy cream, salt, and pepper. Stir in your choice of fillings.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Quiche Minis:</strong> Spoon the filling mixture into the prepared crusts, filling each about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the quiche minis to cool slightly before removing them from the tin. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
