    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free French bread pizza is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create a delicious meal:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your pizza will cook evenly and achieve the perfect level of crispiness.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Bread</h3>
    <p>Slice the gluten-free French bread loaf in half lengthwise. Brush the cut sides with olive oil to help the bread crisp up in the oven. If desired, sprinkle a bit of Italian seasoning over the bread for added flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Sauce and Toppings</h3>
    <p>Spread a generous layer of gluten-free pizza sauce over each half of the bread. Next, sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce. Add your favorite toppings, such as pepperoni, mushrooms, or bell peppers. Be creative and customize your pizza to your liking!</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Pizza</h3>
    <p>Place the prepared bread halves on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the edges of the bread are golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve warm and enjoy your gluten-free French bread pizza!</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free French Bread Pizza</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free French bread pizza turns out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Bread:</strong> Not all gluten-free breads are created equal. Look for a gluten-free French bread that has a good texture and flavor. Some brands may be denser or drier than others, so experiment to find your favorite.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overload with Toppings:</strong> While it's tempting to pile on the toppings, too many can make the pizza soggy. Stick to a moderate amount to maintain the perfect balance of flavors and textures.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh toppings and high-quality cheese can make a big difference in the overall taste of your pizza. Opt for fresh vegetables and high-quality cheese whenever possible.</li>
