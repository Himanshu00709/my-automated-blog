    <h1>Gluten-Free Canapés: A Guide to Delicious and Safe Entertaining</h1>
    <p>When it comes to hosting a party or gathering, canapés are a classic choice. These bite-sized appetizers are not only elegant but also versatile, making them perfect for any occasion. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding safe and delicious options can be a challenge.

    <p>Choosing gluten-free canapés isn’t just about catering to dietary restrictions—it’s also about inclusivity and creativity. By offering gluten-free options, you’re ensuring that all your guests can enjoy the same delicious treats without feeling left out. Additionally, gluten-free canapés can be just as flavorful and visually appealing as their gluten-containing counterparts. With the right ingredients and techniques, you can create a spread that’s both safe and satisfying for everyone.</p>
