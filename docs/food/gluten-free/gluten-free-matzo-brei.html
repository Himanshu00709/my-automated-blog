    <h1>Gluten-Free Matzo Brei: A Delicious Twist on a Classic Dish</h1>

    <p>Matzo brei, a beloved dish in Jewish cuisine, is traditionally made with matzo (unleavened bread) and eggs. It’s a versatile dish that can be enjoyed sweet or savory, making it a favorite during Passover and beyond. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional matzo brei is off the table—literally. Enter gluten-free matzo brei, a delicious and inclusive twist on this classic dish. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about making gluten-free matzo brei, from the ingredients to the cooking process, and even some creative variations.</p>

    <h2>What is Matzo Brei?</h2>

    <p>Matzo brei (pronounced "matzah bray") is a simple yet satisfying dish made by soaking matzo in water or milk, then mixing it with beaten eggs and frying it in a pan.

It’s often served during Passover when leavened bread is avoided, but it’s also enjoyed year-round as a quick and easy meal.</p>

Gluten-free matzo brei allows those with dietary restrictions to enjoy this traditional dish without compromising their health. Plus, with the rise of gluten-free products, it’s easier than ever to find gluten-free matzo that tastes just as good as the original.</p>
