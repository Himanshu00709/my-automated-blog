<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

<p>Start by making the gluten-free dough. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour with water. Mix until a dough forms, then knead it on a lightly floured surface until smooth. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>

<p>While the dough is resting, prepare the pork filling. In a separate bowl, combine the ground pork, minced garlic, ginger, chopped green onions, gluten-free soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble the Dumplings</h3>

<p>After the dough has rested, roll it out into a thin sheet. Use a round cutter or a glass to cut out circles of dough. Place a small amount of the pork filling in the center of each circle. Fold the dough over the filling, sealing the edges by pinching them together. You can also create pleats for a more traditional look.</p>

<h3>4. Cook the Dumplings</h3>

<p>There are several ways to cook gluten-free pork dumplings:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Steaming:</strong> Place the dumplings in a steamer basket and steam for 10-12 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Pan-Frying:</strong> Heat a bit of oil in a pan, place the dumplings in, and cook until the bottoms are golden brown. Add a small amount of water, cover, and steam until cooked through.</li>
    <li><strong>Boiling:</strong> Drop the dumplings into boiling water and cook until they float to the surface, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Serve your gluten-free pork dumplings with a dipping sauce made from gluten-free soy sauce, rice vinegar, and a dash of sesame oil. Garnish with additional chopped green onions or sesame seeds for extra flavor.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pork Dumplings</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different type of meat for the filling?</h3>

    <h3>2. How do I store leftover dumplings?</h3>
    <p>Cooked dumplings can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply steam or pan-fry them until warmed through.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I freeze gluten-free dumplings?</h3>

    <h3>4. Are gluten-free dumplings as tasty as traditional ones?</h3>
    <p>With the right ingredients and preparation, gluten-free dumplings can be just as delicious as their traditional counterparts. The key is to use high-quality gluten-free flour and fresh ingredients for the filling.</p>
