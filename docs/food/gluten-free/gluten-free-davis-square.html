<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Living</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. What is gluten, and why do some people avoid it?</h3>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Some people avoid gluten due to celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes damage to the small intestine when gluten is consumed. Others may have non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which can cause similar symptoms without the intestinal damage.</p>

    <h3>2. Is a gluten-free diet healthier?</h3>
    <p>A gluten-free diet is essential for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, for individuals without these conditions, a gluten-free diet is not necessarily healthier. It’s important to ensure that you’re still getting all the necessary nutrients, as some gluten-free products may lack certain vitamins and minerals.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I eat out safely if I’m gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, many restaurants now offer gluten-free options and are aware of the need to prevent cross-contamination. Always communicate your dietary needs to the staff and ask questions about how food is prepared.</p>

    <h3>4. What are some common gluten-free alternatives?</h3>
    <p>Common gluten-free alternatives include rice, quinoa, corn, and gluten-free oats. There are also many gluten-free flours available, such as almond flour, coconut flour, and chickpea flour, which can be used in baking and cooking.</p>
