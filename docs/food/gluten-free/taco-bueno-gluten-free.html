    <h2>Cross-Contamination Concerns</h2>
    <p>While Taco Bueno offers gluten-free options, it’s important to be aware of the risk of cross-contamination. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods or surfaces. This can happen during food preparation, cooking, or serving. Taco Bueno does not have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen, so there is always a risk of cross-contamination. If you have severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, it’s crucial to communicate your dietary needs to the staff and ask about their preparation methods.</p>

    <p>Here are some tips to help you safely enjoy gluten-free options at Taco Bueno:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> Don’t hesitate to ask the staff about ingredients and preparation methods. They can provide valuable information to help you make safe choices.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt for Simple Dishes:</strong> Choose dishes with fewer ingredients to minimize the risk of cross-contamination. For example, a simple taco with corn tortillas, meat, and cheese is a safer option.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Fried Foods:</strong> Many fried foods are coated in batter that contains gluten. Stick to grilled or baked options to reduce the risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the Menu:</strong> Taco Bueno’s menu is regularly updated, so always check for the latest gluten-free options and any changes in ingredients.</li>
