<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Croquettes</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I bake gluten-free croquettes instead of frying them?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can bake gluten-free croquettes for a healthier alternative. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C), place the croquettes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and bake for 20-25 minutes, turning halfway through, until they are golden and crispy.</p>

    <h3>2. What are some gluten-free alternatives to breadcrumbs?</h3>
    <p>There are several gluten-free alternatives to traditional breadcrumbs, including almond flour, cornmeal, crushed gluten-free crackers, and even ground nuts like pecans or walnuts.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I freeze gluten-free croquettes?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Gluten-free croquettes freeze well. After shaping and coating them, place them on a baking sheet and freeze until solid. Then transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container. When ready to eat, fry or bake them directly from the freezer, adding a few extra minutes to the cooking time.</p>

    <h3>4. Are gluten-free croquettes suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make vegan gluten-free croquettes by using plant-based fillings and substituting the eggs with a flaxseed or chia seed mixture (1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed or chia seeds mixed with 3 tablespoons of water equals one egg).</p>
