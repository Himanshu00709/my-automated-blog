    <h1>Masa Cornbread: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>Cornbread is a staple in many households, especially in the southern United States. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, traditional cornbread recipes can be off-limits due to the inclusion of wheat flour. Enter masa cornbread—a delicious, gluten-free alternative that not only satisfies your cornbread cravings but also offers a unique flavor and texture. In this article, we’ll explore the world of masa cornbread, its benefits, and how you can make it at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Masa?</h2>
    <p>Masa, or masa harina, is a type of flour made from corn that has been treated with an alkaline solution, a process known as nixtamalization. This process not only enhances the nutritional value of the corn but also gives masa its distinctive flavor and texture. Masa is commonly used in traditional Mexican dishes like tortillas, tamales, and pupusas. Its gluten-free nature makes it an excellent choice for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Masa Cornbread?</h2>
    <p>Masa cornbread offers several advantages over traditional cornbread. First and foremost, it is naturally gluten-free, making it a safe option for those with gluten-related disorders. Additionally, masa cornbread has a unique, slightly nutty flavor that sets it apart from regular cornbread. The texture is also different—more dense and moist, which many people find appealing. Finally, masa cornbread is rich in nutrients like calcium, iron, and fiber, thanks to the nixtamalization process.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Masa Cornbread</h2>
    <p>Making masa cornbread at home is surprisingly simple. Here’s a basic recipe to get you started:</p>
