<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Ravioli at Home</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free ravioli at home can be a rewarding experience, allowing you to customize the filling and ensure the freshest ingredients. Here’s a step-by-step guide to making your own gluten-free ravioli:</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend (e.g., rice flour, almond flour, or a pre-made blend)</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water (as needed)</li>
    <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup cooked spinach (optional)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the eggs. Mix until a dough forms, adding water as needed to achieve the right consistency.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth. Wrap in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>While the dough is resting, prepare the filling by mixing the ricotta, Parmesan, and spinach (if using). Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Roll out the dough into thin sheets using a rolling pin or pasta machine. Cut into squares or circles, depending on your preference.</li>
    <li>Place a small amount of filling in the center of each piece of dough. Fold the dough over the filling and press the edges to seal, using a fork to crimp if desired.</li>
    <li>Cook the ravioli in boiling salted water for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Serve with your favorite sauce.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Ravioli</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free ravioli can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be well on your way to creating a delicious dish:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> A blend of flours (like rice, almond, and tapioca) works best for achieving the right texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overfill:</strong> Overfilling the ravioli can cause them to burst during cooking. Use just enough filling to create a pocket without overstuffing.</li>
    <li><strong>Seal Well:</strong> Ensure the edges are well-sealed to prevent the filling from leaking out during cooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook Immediately:</strong> Fresh ravioli should be cooked right away or frozen for later use. They don’t keep well in the fridge for long periods.</li>
</ul>
