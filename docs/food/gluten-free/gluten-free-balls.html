    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Balls</h2>

        <h3>Are gluten-free balls suitable for people with celiac disease?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free balls are suitable for people with celiac disease, provided that all ingredients used are certified gluten-free. Always check labels to ensure there is no cross-contamination with gluten-containing products.</p>

        <h3>Can I make gluten-free balls without nuts?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you have a nut allergy, you can substitute nut butter with seed butter (e.g., sunflower seed butter) and omit any nuts from the recipe. You can also add more seeds or oats to achieve the desired consistency.</p>

        <h3>How long do gluten-free balls last?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free balls can last up to a week when stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to three months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use fresh fruit instead of dried fruit?</h3>
        <p>While dried fruit is typically used in gluten-free balls for its concentrated sweetness and chewy texture, you can experiment with fresh fruit. Keep in mind that fresh fruit may add extra moisture, so you may need to adjust the other ingredients to maintain the right consistency.</p>
