    <h1>Gluten-Free Knish: A Delicious Twist on a Classic Comfort Food</h1>

    <p>Knish, a beloved Eastern European pastry, has been a staple in Jewish cuisine for centuries. Traditionally filled with mashed potatoes, onions, and sometimes meat or cheese, knishes are known for their flaky crust and hearty filling. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a traditional knish can be a challenge. Enter the gluten-free knish—a modern twist on this classic comfort food that allows everyone to indulge without worry.</p>

    <h2>What is a Knish?</h2>

    <p>A knish is a type of baked or fried pastry that originated in Eastern Europe, particularly among Jewish communities. It typically consists of a dough wrapper filled with a savory mixture, most commonly mashed potatoes and onions. The dough is often made with wheat flour, which gives it a tender, flaky texture. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets, many bakers and home cooks have started experimenting with alternative flours to create a gluten-free version of this beloved dish.</p>

    <h2>The Rise of Gluten-Free Knishes</h2>

    <p>As awareness of gluten-related disorders has grown, so has the demand for gluten-free alternatives to traditional foods. Gluten-free knishes have become increasingly popular, not only among those with celiac disease but also among people who choose to avoid gluten for other health reasons. The challenge in creating a gluten-free knish lies in replicating the texture and flavor of the traditional dough while using gluten-free ingredients.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, rice flour, and tapioca flour, are often used in combination to achieve the desired consistency. Xanthan gum or psyllium husk may also be added to help bind the dough and mimic the elasticity that gluten provides. The result is a knish that is just as satisfying as the original, with a crust that is tender and flaky, and a filling that is rich and flavorful.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Knishes at Home</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free knishes at home is easier than you might think. With a few simple ingredients and some patience, you can create a batch of knishes that are perfect for snacking, appetizers, or even a main course. Here’s a basic recipe to get you started:</p>

    </table>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt. Add the cold butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the cold water, mixing until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the dough is chilling, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, mix the mashed potatoes, chopped onions, salt, and pepper until well combined.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/4-inch thickness. Cut the dough into circles or squares, depending on your preference.</li>
        <li>Place a spoonful of the potato filling in the center of each dough piece. Fold the dough over the filling and pinch the edges to seal. Place the knishes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the knishes are golden brown. Allow them to cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
