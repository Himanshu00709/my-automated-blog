    <p>Making gluten-free taquitos at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create this tasty dish in your own kitchen:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 gluten-free corn tortillas</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked and shredded chicken (or your preferred filling)</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Oil for frying (or baking spray if baking)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a bowl, mix the shredded chicken with chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Add shredded cheese if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Warm the Tortillas:</strong> Heat the gluten-free corn tortillas in a microwave or on a skillet until they are pliable. This will prevent them from cracking when rolled.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Taquitos:</strong> Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each tortilla and roll it up tightly. Secure with toothpicks if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Taquitos:</strong> Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry the taquitos until they are golden brown and crispy, turning occasionally. Alternatively, you can bake them in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for 15-20 minutes, or until crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve your gluten-free taquitos with your favorite dipping sauces, such as salsa, guacamole, or sour cream.</li>
    </ol>
