    <p>Making a gluten-free Philly Cheese Steak at home is easier than you might think. With a few simple substitutions, you can recreate this classic sandwich in your own kitchen. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of thinly sliced ribeye steak</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>4 gluten-free rolls or wraps</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onions (and bell peppers if using) to the skillet and sauté until they are soft and caramelized, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the thinly sliced ribeye steak. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the steak is cooked to your desired level of doneness.</li>
        <li>Season the steak with salt and pepper to taste.</li>

        <li>Place slices of provolone cheese on top of the steak and onion mixture, allowing the cheese to melt.</li>
        <li>While the cheese is melting, lightly toast your gluten-free rolls or wraps.</li>
        <li>Once the cheese has melted, divide the steak mixture evenly among the gluten-free rolls or wraps.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your gluten-free Philly Cheese Steak!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Philly Cheese Steak</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free Philly Cheese Steak is as delicious as possible, consider the following tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Bread:</strong> Not all gluten-free breads are created equal. Look for a brand that has a good texture and flavor, as this will greatly enhance your sandwich.</li>
        <li><strong>Slice the Steak Thinly:</strong> The key to a great Philly Cheese Steak is thinly sliced beef. If you're having trouble slicing the steak thinly, consider asking your butcher to do it for you.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overcook the Steak:</strong> Ribeye steak is best when it's cooked to medium-rare or medium. Overcooking can result in a tough and chewy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Cheese:</strong> While provolone is a classic choice, feel free to experiment with other gluten-free cheeses like American, cheddar, or even a dairy-free alternative if you're lactose intolerant.</li>
    </ul>
