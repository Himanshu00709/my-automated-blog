        <li>Place a spoonful of your chosen filling in the center of each circle, fold the dough over to form a half-moon shape, and seal the edges by pressing with a fork.</li>
        <li>Place the empanadas on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
