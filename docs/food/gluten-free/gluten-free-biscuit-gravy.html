<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Biscuit Gravy</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free biscuit gravy is a straightforward process that involves a few simple steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Cook the Sausage:</strong> In a large skillet, cook the gluten-free sausage over medium heat until it is fully browned and cooked through. Remove the sausage from the skillet and set it aside, leaving the drippings in the pan.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the Roux:</strong> Add the butter to the skillet with the sausage drippings and melt it over medium heat. Once the butter is melted, whisk in the gluten-free flour blend. Cook the mixture, stirring constantly, for about 2-3 minutes until it becomes a light golden color.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the Milk:</strong> Gradually pour in the milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Continue to cook the mixture, stirring frequently, until it thickens and comes to a gentle simmer.</li>
    <li><strong>Season and Add Sausage:</strong> Season the gravy with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the cooked sausage and let the gravy simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the gluten-free biscuit gravy over warm, gluten-free biscuits. Enjoy!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Biscuit Gravy</h2>

<p>To ensure your gluten-free biscuit gravy turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps to mimic the texture of traditional flour.</li>
    <li><strong>Whisk Constantly:</strong> When adding the milk to the roux, whisk constantly to prevent lumps from forming. This will help you achieve a smooth and creamy gravy.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust the Thickness:</strong> If your gravy is too thick, you can thin it out by adding a little more milk. If it's too thin, let it simmer for a few more minutes to reduce and thicken.</li>
    <li><strong>Check Labels:</strong> Always double-check the labels on your sausage and other ingredients to ensure they are gluten-free. Some products may contain hidden sources of gluten.</li>
</ul>
