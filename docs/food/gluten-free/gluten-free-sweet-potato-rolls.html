    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all the ingredients ready, let’s move on to the step-by-step recipe for making gluten-free sweet potato rolls:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Yeast Mixture:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the warm water, honey (or maple syrup), and active dry yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Add the mashed sweet potatoes, olive oil (or melted coconut oil), and the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes. The dough should be smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Dough Rise:</strong> Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Rolls:</strong> Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into 12 equal portions. Shape each portion into a ball and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Rise:</strong> Cover the rolls with a kitchen towel and let them rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Brush the tops of the rolls with a beaten egg (or flax egg for a vegan option) and bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the rolls to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy them warm with your favorite spread or as a side to your main dish.</li>
    </ol>
