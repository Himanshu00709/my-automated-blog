                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>1/2 teaspoon</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Black pepper</td>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and grated Parmesan. Mix until well combined. Gradually add the gluten-free flour blend, salt, pepper, and nutmeg (if using). Stir until the dough comes together. The dough should be soft but not sticky. If it’s too sticky, add a bit more flour.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Shape the Gnocchi</h3>
    <p>Divide the dough into four equal parts. On a lightly floured surface, roll each portion into a long rope about 1/2 inch in diameter. Cut the ropes into 1-inch pieces. You can leave them as is or use a fork to create ridges, which help the sauce cling to the gnocchi.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Gnocchi</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Gently drop the gnocchi into the boiling water. They will float to the surface when they are done, which usually takes about 2-3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the water and transfer them to a serving dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free ricotta gnocchi pairs beautifully with a variety of sauces. A simple tomato basil sauce, a creamy Alfredo, or even a light olive oil and garlic sauce can elevate this dish. Garnish with fresh herbs and additional Parmesan cheese for an extra touch of flavor.</p>
