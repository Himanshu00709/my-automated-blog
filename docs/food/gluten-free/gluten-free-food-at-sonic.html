<h1>Gluten-Free Food at Sonic: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, fast-food chains like Sonic Drive-In are increasingly offering gluten-free options to cater to this growing demographic. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free offerings at Sonic, providing you with a detailed guide to help you make informed choices while enjoying your meal.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

<p>Before diving into Sonic’s menu, it’s essential to understand what a gluten-free diet entails. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. A gluten-free diet eliminates all sources of gluten, requiring careful scrutiny of food labels and restaurant menus.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Options at Sonic</h2>

<p>Sonic Drive-In, known for its extensive menu of burgers, hot dogs, and milkshakes, has made strides in offering gluten-free options. While Sonic does not have a dedicated gluten-free menu, several items can be customized to fit a gluten-free diet. Below is a breakdown of gluten-free options available at Sonic:</p>

<h3>1. Burgers and Sandwiches</h3>

</ul>

<p>Be sure to inform the staff of your dietary restrictions to avoid cross-contamination.</p>

<h3>2. Hot Dogs</h3>

<p>Sonic’s classic hot dogs are another option for gluten-free diners. The hot dog itself is gluten-free, but the bun is not. You can request a lettuce wrap or enjoy the hot dog without the bun. Additionally, Sonic offers a variety of toppings, such as chili, cheese, and onions, which are also gluten-free.</p>
