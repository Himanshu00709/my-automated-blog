    <h1>Gluten-Free Khinkali: A Delicious Twist on a Georgian Classic</h1>

    <p>Khinkali, the iconic Georgian dumpling, is a beloved dish known for its juicy filling and unique dough. Traditionally made with wheat flour, khinkali is a staple in Georgian cuisine. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying this delicacy can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free khinkali—a modern twist on the classic recipe that allows everyone to savor this culinary masterpiece. In this article, we’ll explore the history of khinkali, the art of making gluten-free versions, and tips for perfecting this dish at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Khinkali</h2>

    <p>Khinkali has a rich history that dates back centuries. Originating in the mountainous regions of Georgia, this dish was initially a hearty meal for shepherds and travelers. The dumplings are typically filled with spiced meat, herbs, and broth, creating a burst of flavor with every bite. The dough, traditionally made from wheat flour, is rolled thin and pleated to form a unique shape that holds the filling securely. Over time, khinkali has become a symbol of Georgian hospitality and is often enjoyed during festive occasions.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity in recent years, not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals seeking healthier eating habits.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Khinkali</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by mixing the gluten-free flour blend with salt in a large bowl. Gradually add warm water while kneading until the dough comes together. The dough should be smooth and elastic. Cover it with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>

    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the ground meat, chopped onion, minced garlic, fresh herbs, and spices. Mix well, then add the broth to create a juicy filling. The broth will turn into steam during cooking, giving the khinkali its signature juiciness.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Khinkali</h3>

    <p>Roll out the dough into a thin sheet and cut it into circles using a cookie cutter or a glass. Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each circle. Carefully pleat the edges of the dough to seal the filling, creating the classic khinkali shape. Make sure the top is tightly sealed to prevent the broth from leaking out during cooking.</p>

    <h3>4. Cook the Khinkali</h3>

    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Gently drop the khinkali into the boiling water and cook for about 10-12 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Remove them with a slotted spoon and serve immediately.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Khinkali</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that mimics the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overfill the dumplings:</strong> Overfilling can cause the dough to tear during cooking. Stick to a tablespoon of filling per khinkali.</li>
        <li><strong>Seal the edges tightly:</strong> A tight seal ensures that the broth stays inside the dumpling, creating that signature burst of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve with traditional accompaniments:</strong> Khinkali is traditionally served with black pepper and a sprinkle of fresh herbs. You can also enjoy it with a side of sour cream or a spicy dipping sauce.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Khinkali</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free khinkali?</h3>
