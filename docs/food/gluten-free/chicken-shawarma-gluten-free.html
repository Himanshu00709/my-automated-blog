<h1>Chicken Shawarma Gluten-Free: A Delicious and Healthy Option</h1>

<p>Chicken shawarma is a beloved Middle Eastern dish that has gained popularity worldwide for its rich flavors and versatility. Traditionally, shawarma is made by marinating chicken in a blend of spices, then slow-cooking it on a vertical rotisserie. The result is tender, juicy meat that is often served in a wrap or pita bread. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying this dish can be a challenge due to the gluten-containing bread. Fortunately, with a few adjustments, you can enjoy a delicious and healthy gluten-free chicken shawarma that doesn’t compromise on taste or authenticity.</p>

<h2>What Makes Chicken Shawarma Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>To make chicken shawarma gluten-free, the key is to replace the traditional wheat-based pita bread with a gluten-free alternative. Additionally, you need to ensure that all the ingredients used in the marinade and toppings are free from gluten. Here’s a breakdown of the components:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> Naturally gluten-free, but always check for any added seasonings or marinades that may contain gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Marinade:</strong> Typically includes spices like cumin, paprika, turmeric, and garlic, which are gluten-free. However, some pre-made spice blends may contain gluten, so it’s essential to read labels carefully.</li>
    <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> Common toppings like lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and tahini sauce are gluten-free. However, some sauces, such as soy sauce-based dressings, may contain gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Bread:</strong> Replace traditional pita bread with gluten-free wraps, lettuce wraps, or even serve the chicken shawarma over a bed of rice or quinoa.</li>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, cumin, paprika, turmeric, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken pieces and toss to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong> Heat a skillet or grill over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until fully cooked and slightly charred. Alternatively, you can bake the chicken in the oven at 375°F (190°C) for 20-25 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Toppings:</strong> While the chicken is cooking, prepare your toppings. Slice the lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers, and prepare the tahini sauce if using.</li>
    <li><strong>Assemble the Shawarma:</strong> Once the chicken is cooked, slice it into thin strips. Warm the gluten-free wraps or prepare the lettuce leaves. Place the chicken strips on the wrap or lettuce, add your desired toppings, and drizzle with tahini sauce. Fold or roll the wrap and serve immediately.</li>
