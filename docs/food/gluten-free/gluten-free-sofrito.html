    <h1>Gluten-Free Sofrito: A Flavorful Journey</h1>
    <p>Sofrito is a foundational element in many cuisines, particularly in Latin American, Caribbean, and Spanish cooking. This aromatic blend of vegetables, herbs, and spices serves as the base for countless dishes, infusing them with depth and complexity. For those following a gluten-free diet, sofrito offers a versatile and safe way to enhance meals without compromising on flavor.
