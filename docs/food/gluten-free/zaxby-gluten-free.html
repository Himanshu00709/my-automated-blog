<h1>Zaxby's Gluten-Free Options: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield.

In this article, we'll explore Zaxby's gluten-free menu, discuss cross-contamination risks, and provide tips for safely enjoying your meal.</p>

As a result, many people must adhere to a strict gluten-free diet. While Zaxby's is not a gluten-free restaurant, it does offer several menu items that can be enjoyed by those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

<p>While Zaxby's offers gluten-free options, it's important to note that the restaurant is not a gluten-free facility. Cross-contamination can occur in the kitchen, especially when frying foods. For example, the same fryers used for gluten-containing items like breaded chicken fingers may also be used for fries or other gluten-free items. If you have celiac disease or a severe gluten allergy, it's crucial to communicate your dietary needs to the staff and inquire about their preparation methods.</p>

<h2>Tips for Dining Gluten-Free at Zaxby's</h2>

<p>Here are some tips to help you enjoy a safe and satisfying gluten-free meal at Zaxby's:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> Don't hesitate to ask the staff about ingredients and preparation methods. They can provide valuable information to help you make informed choices.</li>
    <li><strong>Choose Grilled Options:</strong> Grilled chicken is a safer bet than fried items, as it avoids the risk of cross-contamination in the fryer.</li>
    <li><strong>Skip the Croutons:</strong> If you're ordering a salad, make sure to ask for it without croutons, which contain gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Check Sauces:</strong> Some sauces may contain gluten, so always verify the ingredients before adding them to your meal.</li>
</ul>
