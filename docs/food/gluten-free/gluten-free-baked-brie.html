    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Baked Brie</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free baked brie is surprisingly simple. Follow these steps to create a dish that will impress your guests:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). This ensures that your baked brie will cook evenly and achieve that perfect golden crust.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Brie</h3>
    <p>Remove the brie from its packaging and place it on a piece of parchment paper. If desired, you can score the top of the brie with a knife to allow the flavors to penetrate the cheese.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Wrap the Brie in Gluten-Free Puff Pastry</h3>
    <p>Roll out your gluten-free puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Place the brie in the center of the pastry and fold the edges over the cheese, sealing it completely. You can brush the pastry with an egg wash for a golden finish.</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Add Toppings (Optional)</h3>
    <p>If you’re adding toppings like honey, nuts, or herbs, drizzle or sprinkle them over the brie before wrapping it in the pastry. This will infuse the cheese with additional flavors as it bakes.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Brie</h3>
    <p>Place the wrapped brie on a baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the cheese is melted. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Baked Brie</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free baked brie turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose High-Quality Ingredients:</strong> Since baked brie is a simple dish, the quality of your ingredients will make a big difference. Opt for a high-quality brie and certified gluten-free puff pastry.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overbake:</strong> Keep an eye on the brie as it bakes. Overbaking can cause the cheese to become too runny and the pastry to burn.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> Don’t be afraid to get creative with your toppings. Try different combinations of nuts, fruits, and herbs to find your favorite flavor profile.</li>
    </ul>
