    <h2>Tips for Ordering Gluten-Free at Taco Casa</h2>

    <p>While Taco Casa offers several gluten-free options, cross-contamination can still be a concern. Here are some tips to ensure a safe dining experience:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Communicate Clearly:</strong> Inform the staff about your gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Ask them to change gloves and use clean utensils to prepare your meal.</li>
        <li><strong>Stick to Corn Tortillas:</strong> Corn tortillas are naturally gluten-free, but always double-check that they haven’t been contaminated by flour tortillas.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Shared Fryers:</strong> Some items, like chips, may be fried in shared oil, which can lead to cross-contamination. Ask if they have a dedicated fryer for gluten-free items.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Sauces and Toppings:</strong> Some sauces and toppings may contain gluten. Always ask for a list of ingredients if you’re unsure.</li>
    </ul>
