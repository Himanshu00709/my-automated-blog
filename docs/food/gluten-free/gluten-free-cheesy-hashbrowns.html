<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Potatoes</h3>
<p>Start by peeling and shredding the potatoes. Once shredded, place them in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much moisture as possible. This step is crucial for achieving crispy hashbrowns.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large bowl, combine the shredded potatoes, chopped onion, minced garlic, beaten egg, gluten-free flour, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed. Then, fold in the shredded cheddar cheese.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Form the Hashbrowns</h3>
<p>Take a handful of the mixture and shape it into a patty. Repeat this process until all the mixture is used. You should be able to make about 6-8 patties, depending on the size.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Cook the Hashbrowns</h3>
<p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the patties in the skillet. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Be sure to flip them gently to avoid breaking the patties.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once cooked, transfer the hashbrowns to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil. Serve hot with your favorite gluten-free condiments, such as ketchup or sour cream. Enjoy your delicious, gluten-free cheesy hashbrowns!</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cheesy Hashbrowns</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! While cheddar cheese is a popular choice, you can experiment with other gluten-free cheeses like mozzarella, pepper jack, or even a dairy-free alternative if you’re lactose intolerant.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I make these hashbrowns ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the mixture ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. When you’re ready to cook, simply form the patties and fry them as directed.</p>

    <h3>3. Are these hashbrowns suitable for a vegan diet?</h3>
    <p>To make this recipe vegan, you can substitute the egg with a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) and use a dairy-free cheese alternative.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I bake these hashbrowns instead of frying them?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can bake them in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through. This method is healthier and reduces the amount of oil used.</p>
</div>
