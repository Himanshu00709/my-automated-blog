    <h2>What is a Crunchwrap Supreme?</h2>

That's where the gluten-free version comes in.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> Gather all your ingredients and ensure they are gluten-free. If you're using store-bought seasoned beef, check the label for any hidden gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Beef:</strong> In a skillet, cook the seasoned beef until it's fully browned and heated through. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Crunchwrap:</strong> Lay the gluten-free tortilla flat on a clean surface. In the center, layer the cooked beef, nacho cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, and the gluten-free tostada shell.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold the Tortilla:</strong> Carefully fold the edges of the tortilla over the filling, creating a hexagon shape. Press down gently to secure the folds.</li>
        <li><strong>Grill the Crunchwrap:</strong> Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat. Place the folded Crunchwrap seam-side down and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
