    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free pigs in a blanket is surprisingly simple. Follow these steps to create a crowd-pleasing snack:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Set your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Roll out your gluten-free crescent roll dough or puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough into thin strips or triangles, depending on the size of your sausages.</li>
        <li><strong>Wrap the Sausages:</strong> Place a cocktail sausage at the wide end of each dough strip and roll it up, ensuring the sausage is fully covered. Seal the edges by pressing lightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Brush with Egg Wash:</strong> Lightly brush each wrapped sausage with egg wash to give them a golden, shiny finish.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Arrange the pigs in a blanket on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the dough is golden brown and cooked through.</li>

        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add a sprinkle of garlic powder, smoked paprika, or grated cheese to the dough before wrapping the sausages for an extra flavor boost.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Cross-Contamination:</strong> If you’re cooking for someone with celiac disease, make sure all utensils, surfaces, and ingredients are free from gluten contamination.</li>
