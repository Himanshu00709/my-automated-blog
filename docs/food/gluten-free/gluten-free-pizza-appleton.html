    <h1>Gluten-Free Pizza in Appleton: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply a preference for gluten-free dining, finding a delicious and safe gluten-free pizza can be a challenge. Fortunately, Appleton, Wisconsin, has embraced the gluten-free movement with a variety of options that cater to this growing demand.

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular over the past decade, not only for those with celiac disease but also for individuals seeking to improve their overall health. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe digestive issues and other health problems for those with gluten-related disorders. For pizza lovers, this means traditional crusts are off the table. However, gluten-free pizza crusts made from alternative flours like rice, almond, or cauliflower have emerged as a tasty and safe alternative.</p>
