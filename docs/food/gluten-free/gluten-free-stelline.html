    <h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Stelline</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free stelline is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to keep in mind to ensure the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil Water:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Use plenty of water to prevent the pasta from sticking together.</li>

        <li><strong>Cook Time:</strong> Gluten-free pasta often cooks faster than traditional pasta, so keep an eye on it. Check the package instructions for the recommended cooking time, usually around 6-8 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Test for Doneness:</strong> Taste a piece of pasta to ensure it is cooked to your desired level of tenderness. Be careful not to overcook, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Serve:</strong> Once cooked, drain the pasta and rinse it briefly with cold water to stop the cooking process. Serve immediately with your favorite sauce or toppings.</li>
    </ol>
