    <h2>Benefits of a Gluten-Free Diet</h2>

    <p>Adopting a gluten-free diet can offer numerous health benefits, especially for individuals with gluten-related disorders. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Digestive Health:</strong> For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, eliminating gluten can lead to significant improvements in digestive health, reducing symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Energy Levels:</strong> Many people report feeling more energetic and less fatigued after switching to a gluten-free diet, as their bodies are no longer struggling to process gluten.</li>
