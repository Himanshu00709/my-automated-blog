    <h1>Dosa: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>Dosa, a traditional South Indian dish, has gained immense popularity worldwide for its unique taste, versatility, and health benefits. One of the most appealing aspects of dosa is that it is naturally gluten-free, making it an excellent choice for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. In this article, we will explore the origins of dosa, its nutritional benefits, and how you can make this delicious dish at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Dosa?</h2>
    <p>Dosa is a type of fermented crepe made from a batter consisting of rice and urad dal (black gram). It is a staple in South Indian cuisine and is often served with a variety of accompaniments such as sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew) and chutney (a condiment made from coconut, tomatoes, or other ingredients). The fermentation process not only enhances the flavor but also increases the nutritional value of the dosa, making it a healthy and satisfying meal.</p>

    <h2>Why is Dosa Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Dosa is naturally gluten-free because it is made from rice and urad dal, both of which do not contain gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Since dosa does not contain any of these grains, it is a safe and delicious option for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Dosa</h2>
    <p>Dosa is not only gluten-free but also packed with essential nutrients. Here are some of the key nutritional benefits of dosa:</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Dosa at Home</h2>
    <p>Making dosa at home is relatively simple, and it allows you to control the ingredients to ensure it remains gluten-free. Here’s a step-by-step guide to making dosa:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of rice (preferably parboiled rice)</li>
        <li>1 cup of urad dal (black gram)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of fenugreek seeds</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water (as needed)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Soak the Ingredients:</strong> Wash the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds separately. Soak them in water for at least 6 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li><strong>Grind the Batter:</strong> After soaking, grind the urad dal and fenugreek seeds together to a smooth paste. Then, grind the rice separately to a slightly coarse consistency. Mix both batters together, add salt, and mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Ferment the Batter:</strong> Allow the batter to ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours. The batter should rise and become slightly frothy.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Dosa:</strong> Heat a non-stick or cast-iron skillet. Pour a ladleful of batter onto the skillet and spread it in a circular motion to form a thin crepe. Drizzle a little oil around the edges and cook until the dosa turns golden brown and crisp.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the dosa hot with sambar and chutney.</li>
    </ol>
