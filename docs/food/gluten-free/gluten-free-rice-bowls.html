    <h2>How to Build the Perfect Gluten-Free Rice Bowl</h2>

    <p>Creating a gluten-free rice bowl is simple and fun. Here’s a step-by-step guide to building the perfect bowl:</p>

    <h3>1. Choose Your Base</h3>

    <p>The foundation of any rice bowl is the grain. While rice is the most common choice, you can also use other gluten-free grains like quinoa, millet, or even cauliflower rice for a low-carb option. Brown rice, white rice, or wild rice are all excellent choices depending on your preference.</p>

    <h3>2. Add Your Protein</h3>

    <p>Protein is an essential component of any balanced meal. For a gluten-free rice bowl, you can choose from a variety of protein sources, including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Animal-Based Proteins:</strong> Grilled chicken, beef, shrimp, salmon, or tofu.</li>
        <li><strong>Plant-Based Proteins:</strong> Lentils, chickpeas, black beans, or tempeh.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Load Up on Vegetables</h3>

    <p>Vegetables add color, texture, and a wealth of nutrients to your rice bowl. You can use fresh, roasted, or sautéed vegetables. Some popular options include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Spinach, kale, or arugula</li>
        <li>Bell peppers, zucchini, or carrots</li>
        <li>Broccoli, cauliflower, or Brussels sprouts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Don’t Forget the Sauce</h3>

    <p>The sauce is what ties all the ingredients together and adds a burst of flavor to your rice bowl. Opt for gluten-free sauces like tamari, tahini, or a simple vinaigrette. You can also make your own sauce at home to ensure it’s free from gluten and other additives.</p>

    <h3>5. Add Some Extras</h3>

    <p>To elevate your rice bowl, consider adding some extras like avocado, nuts, seeds, or a sprinkle of cheese (if you’re not dairy-free). These additions can provide extra flavor, texture, and nutritional value.</p>
