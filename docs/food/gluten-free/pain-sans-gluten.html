    <h2>FAQs About Pain Sans Gluten</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Is gluten-free bread healthier than regular bread?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free bread is not inherently healthier than regular bread. However, it is essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. For others, the healthiness of gluten-free bread depends on the ingredients used. Some gluten-free breads are made with whole, nutrient-dense ingredients, while others may contain added sugars and preservatives.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I freeze gluten-free bread?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze gluten-free bread to extend its shelf life. Wrap the bread tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then place it in a freezer-safe bag. When you're ready to eat it, thaw the bread at room temperature or toast it directly from the freezer.</p>

        <h3>3. Why is gluten-free bread more expensive?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free bread is often more expensive due to the cost of gluten-free flours and the additional ingredients needed to replicate the texture of traditional bread. Additionally, gluten-free products are often produced in smaller quantities, which can drive up the price.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I use regular yeast for gluten-free bread?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular active dry yeast for gluten-free bread. The yeast helps the bread rise, but since gluten-free dough lacks the elasticity of traditional dough, additional ingredients like xanthan gum or psyllium husk are needed to provide structure.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Pain sans gluten is a fantastic option for anyone looking to avoid gluten, whether for medical reasons or personal preference. With its growing popularity, gluten-free bread has become more accessible and delicious than ever before. Whether you choose to buy it from the store or make it at home, pain sans gluten offers a versatile and satisfying alternative to traditional bread.
