<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Black Forest Cake</h2>

<p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free Black Forest cake:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chocolate Sponge Cake</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine your gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy. Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, being careful not to overmix. Pour the batter into a greased cake pan and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool completely before assembling.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Cherry Filling</h3>
<p>While the cake is cooling, prepare the cherry filling. In a saucepan, combine pitted cherries, sugar, and a splash of kirsch. Cook over medium heat until the cherries soften and the mixture thickens. Set aside to cool.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Whip the Cream</h3>
<p>In a chilled bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Add a touch of sugar and vanilla extract for sweetness. Be careful not to overwhip, as the cream can become grainy.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Assemble the Cake</h3>
<p>Once the cake has cooled, slice it horizontally into two or three layers. Brush each layer with a light coating of kirsch. Spread a layer of whipped cream over the first cake layer, followed by a generous amount of cherry filling. Repeat the process for the remaining layers. Finish by covering the entire cake with whipped cream and decorating with chocolate shavings and fresh cherries.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Black Forest Cake</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I make this cake dairy-free as well?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute the heavy cream with a dairy-free alternative like coconut cream. Ensure that all other ingredients, such as chocolate, are also dairy-free.</p>

    <h3>2. How do I store a gluten-free Black Forest cake?</h3>
    <p>Store the cake in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The whipped cream and cherry filling can cause the cake to become soggy if left at room temperature for too long.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I use frozen cherries instead of fresh ones?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Frozen cherries work just as well as fresh ones. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in the filling.</p>

    <h3>4. Is this cake suitable for people with celiac disease?</h3>
    <p>Yes, as long as all ingredients are certified gluten-free and there is no cross-contamination during preparation, this cake is safe for individuals with celiac disease.</p>

<p>The gluten-free Black Forest cake is a testament to how classic desserts can be adapted to meet modern dietary needs without sacrificing flavor or texture. Whether you’re gluten-intolerant, celiac, or simply looking to try something new, this cake is sure to impress. With its rich chocolate layers, tart cherries, and fluffy whipped cream, it’s a dessert that brings joy to any occasion.
