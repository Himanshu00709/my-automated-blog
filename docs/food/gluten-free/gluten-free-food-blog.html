    <h1>Gluten-Free Food Blog: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the gluten-free diet has gained immense popularity, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle.

        <li><strong>Increased Energy Levels:</strong> Some people report feeling more energetic after cutting out gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight Management:</strong> A gluten-free diet can help with weight loss, especially when combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise.</li>
