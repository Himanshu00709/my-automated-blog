<h2>What Are Gluten-Free Pancakes?</h2>

<p>Choosing gluten-free pancakes is essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity to avoid adverse health effects. However, even those without gluten intolerance may opt for gluten-free pancakes for various reasons, including dietary preferences, weight management, or simply to explore new flavors. Gluten-free pancakes can be just as fluffy and delicious as their traditional counterparts, and they often come with added nutritional benefits from alternative flours.</p>
