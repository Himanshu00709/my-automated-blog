    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Thanksgiving Rolls</h2>
    <p>Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s dive into a simple yet delicious recipe for gluten-free Thanksgiving rolls. This recipe yields soft, fluffy rolls that are perfect for your holiday table.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon xanthan gum (if not included in your flour blend)</li>
        <li>1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup warm milk (dairy or non-dairy)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup melted butter or olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 egg (or flax egg for a vegan option)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Activate the Yeast:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the warm milk, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt. Add the activated yeast mixture, melted butter, and egg. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) and knead for about 5 minutes until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Dough Rise:</strong> Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Rolls:</strong> Once the dough has risen, divide it into 12 equal portions and shape each into a ball. Place the balls on a greased baking sheet, leaving some space between each roll.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Rise:</strong> Cover the rolls with a kitchen towel and let them rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the rolls for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove the rolls from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving. Enjoy warm with butter or your favorite spread.</li>
    </ol>
