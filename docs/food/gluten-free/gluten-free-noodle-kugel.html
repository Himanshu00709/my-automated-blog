<h1>Gluten-Free Noodle Kugel: A Delicious Twist on a Classic Dish</h1>

<p>Noodle kugel is a beloved dish in Jewish cuisine, often served during holidays and family gatherings. Traditionally made with egg noodles, eggs, dairy, and a touch of sweetness, it’s a comforting casserole that bridges the gap between savory and sweet. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic dish can be a challenge. Enter <strong>gluten-free noodle kugel</strong>—a delicious and inclusive twist that allows everyone to savor this timeless favorite.</p>

<h2>What is Noodle Kugel?</h2>

<p>Noodle kugel is a baked casserole that combines egg noodles with a custard-like mixture of eggs, dairy (such as sour cream or cottage cheese), and often a sweetener like sugar or honey. Some versions include raisins, apples, or cinnamon for added flavor. The dish is baked until golden and can be served as a side dish or dessert. Its origins trace back to Eastern European Jewish communities, where it became a staple of holiday meals, particularly during Rosh Hashanah and Passover.</p>

<h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free products has made it easier to adapt traditional recipes like noodle kugel. By using gluten-free noodles, you can enjoy the same comforting flavors without the adverse effects of gluten.</p>

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Noodle Kugel</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free noodle kugel is straightforward and follows the same basic steps as the traditional version. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Set your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter or margarine.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the noodles:</strong> Boil the gluten-free egg noodles according to the package instructions. Be careful not to overcook, as gluten-free noodles can become mushy. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the custard:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, sour cream, cottage cheese, sugar, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine noodles and custard:</strong> Add the cooked noodles to the custard mixture and stir until evenly coated. If using raisins or dried fruit, fold them in at this stage.</li>
    <li><strong>Transfer to the baking dish:</strong> Pour the noodle mixture into the prepared baking dish and spread it evenly. Sprinkle cinnamon on top for a warm, aromatic finish.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the center is set.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the kugel to cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. It can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature.</li>
</ol>
