    <h1>Gluten-Free Teriyaki Chicken Bowl: A Healthy and Flavorful Delight</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free meals has skyrocketed, driven by both health-conscious individuals and those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Among the many gluten-free options available, the teriyaki chicken bowl stands out as a delicious and nutritious choice. This dish combines the savory flavors of teriyaki sauce with tender chicken, fresh vegetables, and wholesome grains, making it a perfect meal for anyone looking to enjoy a gluten-free diet without sacrificing taste.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Teriyaki Chicken Bowl Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Traditional teriyaki sauce is made with soy sauce, which typically contains wheat and is therefore not gluten-free. However, by substituting regular soy sauce with gluten-free tamari or coconut aminos, you can create a gluten-free teriyaki sauce that is just as flavorful. Additionally, ensuring that all other ingredients, such as the chicken, vegetables, and grains, are free from gluten contamination is essential for a truly gluten-free meal.</p>
