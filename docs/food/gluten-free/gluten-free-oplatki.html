    <h1>Gluten-Free Oplatki: A Delicious Tradition for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Oplatki, a cherished tradition in many Eastern European cultures, is a thin, unleavened wafer that holds deep symbolic meaning, especially during Christmas Eve celebrations. Traditionally made from wheat flour, oplatki are shared among family members as a sign of love, forgiveness, and unity. However, for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, enjoying this tradition can be challenging. Enter gluten-free oplatki—a modern twist on a timeless tradition that ensures everyone can partake in this meaningful ritual.</p>

    <h2>What Are Oplatki?</h2>

    <p>Oplatki (pronounced oh-PWAHT-kee) are thin, rectangular wafers, often embossed with religious images such as the Nativity scene or the Holy Family. Originating in Poland, Lithuania, and Slovakia, these wafers are a staple of the Wigilia, or Christmas Eve supper. The tradition involves breaking the wafer and sharing it with loved ones, accompanied by wishes for health, happiness, and prosperity in the coming year.</p>

    <p>For centuries, oplatki were made exclusively from wheat flour, making them off-limits for those with gluten-related disorders. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets and increased awareness of celiac disease, gluten-free oplatki have become a welcome alternative, allowing everyone to participate in this beautiful custom.</p>

    <h2>The Rise of Gluten-Free Oplatki</h2>

    <p>The demand for gluten-free oplatki has grown significantly in recent years, driven by the increasing prevalence of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, affects approximately 1% of the global population. For these individuals, consuming gluten can lead to severe digestive issues, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term health complications.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free oplatki are typically made from alternative flours such as rice flour, tapioca flour, or a blend of gluten-free grains. These wafers are carefully crafted to mimic the texture and taste of traditional oplatki while being safe for those with gluten intolerance. Many manufacturers also ensure that their gluten-free oplatki are produced in dedicated facilities to avoid cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>How Gluten-Free Oplatki Are Made</h2>

    <p>The process of making gluten-free oplatki is similar to that of traditional oplatki, with a few key differences. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
