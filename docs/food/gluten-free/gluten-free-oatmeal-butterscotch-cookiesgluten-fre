<h2>Gluten-Free Pasta: From Orecchiette to Ravioli</h2>
<p>Gluten-free pasta has come a long way, with options ranging from classic shapes like orecchiette and rigatoni to stuffed varieties like pumpkin ravioli. When shopping for gluten-free pasta, look for brands that use high-quality ingredients like brown rice flour, quinoa, or chickpea flour.

For those who enjoy making pasta from scratch, consider taking a gluten-free pasta-making class to learn the art of crafting your own noodles.</p>

<h3>Gluten-Free Pasta Suppliers</h3>
<p>Finding reliable gluten-free pasta suppliers is crucial for maintaining a gluten-free diet. Some popular brands include Barilla, Jovial, and Tinkyada.

<h3>Gluten-Free Sourdough Bread</h3>

You can find gluten-free sourdough bread for sale in many specialty stores, or you can try making your own using a gluten-free sourdough starter.

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<div class="faq">
    <h3>Is gluten-free pasta healthier than regular pasta?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free pasta can be a healthier option for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it’s important to check the ingredients, as some gluten-free pastas may be higher in calories or lower in fiber compared to traditional pasta.</p>

    <h3>Can I make gluten-free sourdough bread at home?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make gluten-free sourdough bread at home. You’ll need a gluten-free sourdough starter, which you can either purchase or make yourself. The process is similar to traditional sourdough but requires gluten-free flours like rice or buckwheat flour.</p>

    <h3>Are all oats gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Not all oats are gluten-free. While oats themselves do not contain gluten, they are often processed in facilities that also handle wheat, barley, and rye, leading to cross-contamination. Always look for oats that are certified gluten-free.</p>
