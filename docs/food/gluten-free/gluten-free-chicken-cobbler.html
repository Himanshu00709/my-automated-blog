    <h1>Gluten-Free Chicken Cobbler: A Comfort Food Revolution</h1>
    <p>Comfort food has a unique way of warming the soul, and few dishes do it better than a hearty chicken cobbler. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional recipes can be off-limits. Enter the gluten-free chicken cobbler—a dish that combines the comforting flavors of a classic cobbler with the health benefits of a gluten-free diet. In this article, we’ll explore the origins of chicken cobbler, the benefits of going gluten-free, and how to create a delicious gluten-free version of this beloved dish.</p>

    <h2>What is Chicken Cobbler?</h2>
    <p>Chicken cobbler is a savory twist on the classic dessert cobbler. Instead of sweet fruit fillings, it features tender chicken, vegetables, and a rich, creamy sauce, all topped with a biscuit-like crust. The dish is baked until the topping is golden and crispy, creating a perfect contrast to the creamy filling. It’s a versatile dish that can be customized with various herbs, spices, and vegetables, making it a favorite for family dinners and potlucks alike.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals seeking to improve their overall health. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause inflammation and digestive issues in sensitive individuals. By opting for gluten-free alternatives, you can enjoy the same comforting dishes without the adverse effects. Additionally, gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour offer unique flavors and textures that can elevate your cooking.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the cooking process. Follow these steps to create a mouthwatering gluten-free chicken cobbler:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add the mixed vegetables and sauté until tender. Stir in the shredded chicken and season with salt and pepper. Gradually add 1 cup of gluten-free flour, stirring constantly to create a roux. Slowly pour in the chicken broth and heavy cream, stirring until the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the remaining gluten-free flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Cut in the remaining butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add milk or a dairy-free alternative until a dough forms. Roll out the dough on a floured surface and cut into biscuit-sized rounds.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Pour the chicken filling into a greased baking dish. Arrange the biscuit rounds on top, leaving a little space between each. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

        <p>A blend that includes xanthan gum, such as Bob’s Red Mill Gluten-Free 1-to-1 Baking Flour, works well for both the filling and the topping. It provides a texture similar to traditional flour.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free chicken cobbler?</h3>
