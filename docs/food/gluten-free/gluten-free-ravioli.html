    <h1>Gluten-Free Ravioli: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>Ravioli, the beloved Italian pasta, has been a staple in kitchens around the world for centuries. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying traditional ravioli can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free ravioli—a delicious and healthy alternative that allows everyone to savor this classic dish without compromising on taste or texture.

    <p>The filling of gluten-free ravioli can vary widely, just like traditional ravioli. Common fillings include cheese, spinach, mushrooms, and butternut squash. The key difference lies in the dough, which is carefully crafted to mimic the texture and elasticity of traditional pasta dough without the use of gluten.</p>

    <ol>

        <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Use a rolling pin or pasta machine to roll the dough into thin sheets. Be careful not to roll it too thin, as gluten-free dough can be more delicate than traditional pasta dough.</li>

    </ol>
