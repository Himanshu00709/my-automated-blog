    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free green onion pancakes:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, tapioca flour, xanthan gum, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of the ingredients. Gradually add the warm water while stirring until a dough forms. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Green Onions</h3>
    <p>Once the dough is ready, fold in the chopped green onions. Make sure the onions are evenly distributed throughout the dough. This will ensure that every bite of your pancake is packed with flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Pancakes</h3>
    <p>Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball and then flatten it into a disc shape using a rolling pin. Aim for a thickness of about ¼ inch. If the dough is too sticky, you can lightly dust your work surface with gluten-free flour.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Pancakes</h3>
    <p>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add a tablespoon of vegetable oil. Place one of the flattened dough discs into the skillet and cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Repeat this process with the remaining dough discs, adding more oil as needed.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once cooked, transfer the pancakes to a plate and let them cool slightly before serving. You can enjoy them as is or pair them with your favorite dipping sauce, such as soy sauce or a gluten-free hoisin sauce.</p>
