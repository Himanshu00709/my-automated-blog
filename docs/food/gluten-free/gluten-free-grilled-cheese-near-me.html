<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Grilled Cheese</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. What is gluten-free bread made of?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free bread is typically made from a combination of gluten-free flours such as rice flour, almond flour, coconut flour, or tapioca flour. These flours are mixed with other ingredients like xanthan gum or psyllium husk to mimic the texture of traditional wheat bread.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I use regular cheese for a gluten-free grilled cheese?</h3>
    <p>Most cheeses are naturally gluten-free, but it's essential to check the label to ensure that no gluten-containing additives have been used. Some processed cheeses may contain gluten, so always opt for natural, unprocessed cheeses when possible.</p>

    <h3>3. Are there any gluten-free grilled cheese options at fast-food restaurants?</h3>
    <p>While fast-food restaurants are not typically known for their gluten-free options, some chains are beginning to offer gluten-free menu items. It's always best to check the restaurant's website or speak with a manager to confirm the availability of gluten-free options.</p>

    <h3>4. How can I ensure that my grilled cheese is completely gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>To ensure that your grilled cheese is completely gluten-free, use certified gluten-free bread and cheese, and avoid cross-contamination by using clean utensils and cookware. If dining out, communicate your dietary needs to the staff to ensure that your meal is prepared safely.</p>
