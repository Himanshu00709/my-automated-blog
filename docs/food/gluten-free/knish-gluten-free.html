    <h1>Gluten-Free Knish: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>Knish, a traditional Eastern European pastry, has been a beloved comfort food for generations. Typically filled with mashed potatoes, onions, and sometimes meat or cheese, knishes are known for their flaky crust and hearty filling. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a traditional knish can be a challenge. Enter the gluten-free knish—a delicious and healthy alternative that allows everyone to savor this classic dish without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>What is a Gluten-Free Knish?</h2>
    <p>A gluten-free knish is a variation of the traditional knish that uses gluten-free ingredients in both the dough and the filling. The dough is typically made from a blend of gluten-free flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour, which mimic the texture of traditional wheat-based dough. The filling remains largely the same, often featuring mashed potatoes, caramelized onions, and other savory ingredients. The result is a knish that is just as satisfying as the original but safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Knish?</h2>
    <p>There are several reasons why someone might choose a gluten-free knish:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Celiac Disease:</strong> Individuals with celiac disease must avoid gluten to prevent damage to their small intestine.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten Sensitivity:</strong> Some people experience digestive discomfort or other symptoms when consuming gluten, even if they do not have celiac disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Health-Conscious Choices:</strong> Many people choose gluten-free options as part of a healthier lifestyle, believing it to be easier on their digestive system.</li>

    </table>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt. Cut in the cold butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add cold water, mixing until the dough comes together. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the mashed potatoes and caramelized onions. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Knish:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/4 inch thickness. Cut the dough into squares or circles, depending on your preference. Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each piece of dough, then fold the dough over the filling, sealing the edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the knishes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the tops with a little melted butter or egg wash for a golden finish. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the knishes are golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Allow the knishes to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy them warm with your favorite dipping sauce or as a standalone snack.</li>
