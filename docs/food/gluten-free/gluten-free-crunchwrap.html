    <p>Creating a gluten-free crunchwrap at home is easier than you might think. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you make this delicious dish:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 large gluten-free tortilla</li>
        <li>1 tostada shell (ensure it's gluten-free)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cooked and seasoned ground beef or chicken (or a plant-based alternative)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded cheese (dairy or non-dairy)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sour cream or a dairy-free alternative</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon salsa</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil or cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a skillet, cook your choice of protein with your preferred seasonings. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Crunchwrap:</strong> Lay the gluten-free tortilla flat on a clean surface. Place the tostada shell in the center. Layer the cooked protein, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa on top of the tostada shell.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold the Tortilla:</strong> Carefully fold the edges of the tortilla over the filling, creating a hexagonal shape. Press down gently to secure the folds.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Crunchwrap:</strong> Heat a skillet over medium heat and lightly grease it with olive oil or cooking spray.

        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Remove the crunchwrap from the skillet, let it cool for a minute, then slice it in half and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Crunchwraps</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I make a gluten-free crunchwrap vegan?</h3>

        <h3>2. Where can I find gluten-free tortillas?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free tortillas are widely available in most grocery stores, usually in the health food or gluten-free section. You can also find them online if your local store doesn't carry them.</p>

        <h3>3. How do I ensure my tostada shell is gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Check the packaging for a gluten-free label. Many brands now offer gluten-free tostada shells, but it's always a good idea to read the ingredients list to be sure.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I prepare gluten-free crunchwraps in advance?</h3>

        <h3>5. Are gluten-free crunchwraps healthy?</h3>
        <p>Yes, they can be! By choosing lean proteins, fresh vegetables, and healthy fats, you can create a balanced and nutritious meal. Just be mindful of portion sizes and the amount of cheese and sour cream you use.</p>
