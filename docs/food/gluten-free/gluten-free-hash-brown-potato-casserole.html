    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making your gluten-free hash brown potato casserole:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This will ensure that your casserole bakes evenly and comes out perfectly golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the frozen hash brown potatoes, gluten-free cream of chicken soup, sour cream, 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese, melted butter, chopped onion, salt, and black pepper. Mix everything together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Transfer to a Baking Dish</h3>
    <p>Transfer the mixture to a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread it out evenly with a spatula to ensure that it bakes uniformly.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Topping</h3>
    <p>Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese over the top of the casserole. If you’re using gluten-free breadcrumbs, sprinkle them on top as well for an extra crunch.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the casserole is bubbly and the top is golden brown. You can check for doneness by inserting a knife into the center; it should come out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Let it Rest</h3>
    <p>Once the casserole is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before serving. This will allow the flavors to meld together and make it easier to cut into portions.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Customizing Your Casserole</h2>

    <p>One of the best things about hash brown potato casserole is its versatility. Here are a few tips for customizing your gluten-free version:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Add Protein:</strong> Consider adding cooked bacon, ham, or sausage to the casserole for an extra protein boost.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetable Add-Ins:</strong> Mix in some sautéed mushrooms, spinach, or bell peppers for added flavor and nutrition.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese Variations:</strong> Experiment with different types of cheese, such as mozzarella, pepper jack, or a blend of cheeses, to change up the flavor profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Spice it Up:</strong> Add a pinch of cayenne pepper or some diced jalapeños if you like a bit of heat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this casserole ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the casserole up to a day in advance. Simply cover it with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and refrigerate until you’re ready to bake. You may need to add a few extra minutes to the baking time if you’re starting with a cold casserole.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I freeze the casserole?</h3>
