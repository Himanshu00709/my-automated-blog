    <h1>Gluten-Free Wings: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>When it comes to comfort food, chicken wings are a universal favorite. Whether you're enjoying them at a sports bar, a family gathering, or a casual dinner at home, wings are a crowd-pleaser. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional wings can be off-limits due to the gluten-containing ingredients often used in their preparation. Enter gluten-free wings—a delicious and healthy alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this beloved dish without worry. In this article, we'll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free wings, from their benefits to how to make them at home.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Wings?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free wings are chicken wings that are prepared without any gluten-containing ingredients. This means that the breading, sauces, and seasonings used in the recipe are all free from gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. By using gluten-free alternatives, you can enjoy wings that are just as flavorful and satisfying as the traditional version.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Wings</h2>
    <p>There are several benefits to choosing gluten-free wings, whether you have a gluten intolerance or simply want to explore healthier eating options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthier Option:</strong> Gluten-free wings often use healthier ingredients, such as almond flour or cornstarch, for breading. These alternatives can be lower in calories and higher in nutrients compared to traditional wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Digestive Comfort:</strong> For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, gluten-free wings can prevent uncomfortable digestive symptoms like bloating, gas, and diarrhea.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Gluten-free wings can be prepared in a variety of ways, from baked to fried, and can be paired with a wide range of gluten-free sauces and dips.</li>
        <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Serving gluten-free wings ensures that everyone at the table can enjoy the meal, regardless of dietary restrictions.</li>
