<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fall Recipes</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use regular flour in these recipes if I don’t need to avoid gluten?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute regular flour for gluten-free flour in most recipes. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly. If you’re baking, you may need to adjust the liquid content as gluten-free flours often absorb more moisture.</p>

    <h3>2. Are all oats gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Not all oats are gluten-free. While oats themselves do not contain gluten, they are often processed in facilities that also handle wheat, barley, and rye, which can lead to cross-contamination. Look for oats that are specifically labeled as "gluten-free" to ensure they are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make these recipes vegan as well?</h3>
    <p>Many of these recipes can be adapted to be vegan. For example, you can use plant-based milk and butter in place of dairy, and substitute eggs with flax eggs or chia eggs in baking. Always check the ingredients to ensure they align with your dietary preferences.</p>
