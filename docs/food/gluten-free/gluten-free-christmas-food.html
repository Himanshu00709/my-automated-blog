    <h1>Gluten-Free Christmas Food: A Festive Guide</h1>
    <p>Christmas is a time for celebration, family gatherings, and, of course, delicious food. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, navigating the festive season can be a challenge. The good news is that gluten-free Christmas food can be just as delicious and festive as traditional dishes. In this guide, we’ll explore how to create a gluten-free Christmas feast that everyone can enjoy, from appetizers to desserts.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free During Christmas?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergies. Consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues for these individuals, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term complications. Even if you don’t have a gluten-related condition, opting for gluten-free options can be a healthier choice, as it often involves consuming more whole, unprocessed foods. During Christmas, when indulgence is the norm, gluten-free recipes can help you enjoy the festivities without compromising your health.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Christmas Appetizers</h2>
    <p>Start your Christmas meal with a selection of gluten-free appetizers that will impress your guests. Here are some ideas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Stuffed Mushrooms:</strong> Fill mushrooms with a mixture of gluten-free breadcrumbs, herbs, and cheese, then bake until golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Smoked Salmon Canapés:</strong> Top gluten-free crackers with cream cheese, smoked salmon, and a sprinkle of dill.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetable Spring Rolls:</strong> Use rice paper wrappers to create gluten-free spring rolls filled with fresh vegetables and served with a tangy dipping sauce.</li>
    </ul>
