    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Pastry:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and salt. Add the cold, diced butter and use your fingers to rub it into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Gradually add the cold water, mixing until a dough forms. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> While the dough is chilling, prepare the sausage filling. In a bowl, mix the sausage meat with your chosen seasonings. You can also add finely chopped onions, garlic, or herbs for extra flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Once the dough has chilled, roll it out on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Rolls:</strong> Cut the rolled-out dough into strips, each about 3 inches wide. Place a portion of the sausage mixture along the length of each strip, then fold the dough over the filling, sealing the edges with a fork.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Place the sausage rolls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the tops with beaten egg for a golden finish. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the sausage is cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Allow the sausage rolls to cool slightly before serving. They can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature, making them perfect for picnics, parties, or a quick snack.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Sausage Rolls</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I freeze gluten-free sausage rolls?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free sausage rolls can be frozen either before or after baking. If freezing before baking, assemble the rolls and place them on a baking sheet in the freezer until solid. Once frozen, transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container. When ready to bake, simply place them on a baking sheet and bake from frozen, adding a few extra minutes to the cooking time. If freezing after baking, allow the rolls to cool completely before freezing. Reheat in the oven until warmed through.</p>

        <h3>2. What gluten-free flour is best for sausage rolls?</h3>
        <p>The best gluten-free flour for sausage rolls depends on your preference and dietary needs. A gluten-free flour blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch often works well. Almond flour can also be used for a nuttier flavor and added nutritional benefits. Experiment with different flours to find the one that suits your taste and texture preferences.</p>

        <h3>3. Are gluten-free sausage rolls healthier than regular sausage rolls?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free sausage rolls can be healthier than regular sausage rolls, especially for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. However, it's important to note that the healthiness of the sausage rolls also depends on the quality of the ingredients used, such as the type of sausage meat and the amount of fat in the pastry. Opting for lean sausage meat and using healthier fats in the pastry can make gluten-free sausage rolls a nutritious option.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make vegan gluten-free sausage rolls?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make vegan gluten-free sausage rolls by using plant-based sausage meat and substituting the butter in the pastry with a vegan alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan margarine. Additionally, use a flaxseed or chia seed egg as a binder in the pastry and for the egg wash. There are many vegan sausage options available that can be seasoned to mimic the flavor of traditional sausage.</p>
