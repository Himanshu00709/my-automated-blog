    <h2>Tips for Baking the Perfect Gluten-Free Pie</h2>
    <p>Baking a gluten-free pie can be a bit different from baking a traditional pie, but with the right techniques, you can achieve a delicious result. Here are some tips to help you get started:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Different gluten-free flours have different properties, so it's important to choose the right one for your recipe. Almond flour works well for a nutty flavor, while rice flour is great for a lighter texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Binder:</strong> Gluten-free crusts can be crumbly, so adding a binder like xanthan gum or eggs can help hold the dough together.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Chilling the dough before rolling it out can make it easier to handle and prevent it from falling apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Bake the Crust:</strong> Pre-baking the crust can help prevent it from becoming soggy when you add the filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Fillings:</strong> Don't be afraid to get creative with your fillings. Gluten-free pies can be made with a wide variety of ingredients, so feel free to experiment with different flavors and combinations.</li>
    </ul>
