    <h1>Drunken Noodles Gluten-Free: A Flavorful and Healthy Twist</h1>

    <p>Drunken noodles, or Pad Kee Mao, is a beloved Thai dish known for its bold flavors and satisfying texture. Traditionally made with wide rice noodles, this dish is a favorite among those who enjoy a spicy, savory, and slightly sweet combination. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying traditional drunken noodles can be a challenge due to the potential presence of gluten in soy sauce and other ingredients. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can create a gluten-free version of drunken noodles that is just as delicious and satisfying.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Drunken Noodles Special?</h2>

The result is a dish that is both hearty and vibrant, with a perfect balance of flavors.</p>

    <p>However, traditional soy sauce and oyster sauce contain wheat, which makes them unsuitable for a gluten-free diet. The good news is that there are gluten-free alternatives available that allow you to enjoy this dish without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Drunken Noodles</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free drunken noodles is a straightforward process that involves preparing the sauce, cooking the noodles, and stir-frying the ingredients. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of gluten-free soy sauce (or tamari), 1 tablespoon of gluten-free oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and a pinch of chili flakes. Mix well and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Noodles</h3>
    <p>Cook the gluten-free rice noodles according to the package instructions. Be careful not to overcook them, as they can become mushy. Once cooked, rinse them under cold water to stop the cooking process and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Stir-Fry the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Heat a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat and add 1-2 tablespoons of oil. Add minced garlic and sliced chili peppers, and stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Add your choice of protein (chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu) and cook until nearly done. Then, add sliced bell peppers and any other vegetables you like, and stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Everything</h3>
    <p>Add the cooked noodles to the wok, followed by the prepared sauce. Toss everything together until the noodles are well-coated and heated through. Finally, add a handful of fresh basil leaves and give it one final toss before serving.</p>
