    <h1>Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese Cups: A Delicious and Convenient Treat</h1>
    <p>Mac and cheese is a classic comfort food that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for generations. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this beloved dish can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free mac and cheese cups—a convenient, delicious, and safe alternative that allows everyone to indulge in this creamy, cheesy delight.

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese Cups?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free mac and cheese cups are single-serving portions of macaroni and cheese that are made without any gluten-containing ingredients. Traditional mac and cheese typically uses wheat-based pasta, which contains gluten. Gluten-free versions, however, use pasta made from alternative grains such as rice, corn, quinoa, or legumes like chickpeas and lentils. These cups are often pre-packaged and can be easily prepared by adding hot water or microwaving, making them a convenient option for busy individuals or those on the go.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese Cups?</h2>

        <li><strong>Dietary Preferences:</strong> Some people choose to avoid gluten for personal or health reasons, even if they do not have a diagnosed gluten-related condition. Gluten-free mac and cheese cups offer a way to adhere to these dietary preferences while still enjoying a tasty meal.</li>
