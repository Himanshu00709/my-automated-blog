    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Pork:</strong> Cut the pork shoulder into 2-inch cubes. Season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate:</strong> In a large bowl, combine orange juice, lime juice, minced garlic, cumin, oregano, and bay leaves. Add the pork cubes and let them marinate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for deeper flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook:</strong> Transfer the marinated pork and liquid to a large pot or Dutch oven. Add gluten-free chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2.5 to 3 hours, or until the pork is tender and easily shreds with a fork.</li>
