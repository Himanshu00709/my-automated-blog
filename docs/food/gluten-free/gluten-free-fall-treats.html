<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fall Treats</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use regular flour in gluten-free recipes?</h3>
    <p>No, regular flour contains gluten, which is a protein that can cause issues for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. It's important to use gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or oat flour in your recipes.</p>

    <h3>2. Are all oats gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>While oats are naturally gluten-free, they are often processed in facilities that also handle wheat, barley, and rye, which can lead to cross-contamination. Look for oats that are specifically labeled as gluten-free to ensure they are safe to eat.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I substitute gluten-free flour 1:1 in recipes?</h3>
    <p>Not always. Gluten-free flours have different properties than wheat flour, so you may need to adjust the amount of liquid or add a binding agent like xanthan gum to achieve the desired texture. It's best to follow a recipe specifically designed for gluten-free baking.</p>

    <h3>4. What are some easy gluten-free fall snacks?</h3>
    <p>Some easy gluten-free fall snacks include roasted pumpkin seeds, apple slices with almond butter, and gluten-free granola bars. These snacks are quick to prepare and perfect for on-the-go enjoyment.</p>
