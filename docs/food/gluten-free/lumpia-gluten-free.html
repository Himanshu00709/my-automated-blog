    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Lumpia</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free lumpia is a straightforward process that involves preparing the filling, wrapping it in gluten-free wrappers, and frying until golden brown. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by sautéing garlic and onions in a pan until fragrant. Add the ground meat and cook until browned. Stir in the chopped vegetables and cook until tender. Season with gluten-free soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Allow the mixture to cool before wrapping.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Wrap the Lumpia</h3>
    <p>Lay a gluten-free wrapper on a flat surface. Place a spoonful of the filling near one edge of the wrapper. Fold the sides over the filling, then roll tightly to form a cylinder. Seal the edge with a bit of water or egg wash to prevent it from unraveling during frying.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Fry the Lumpia</h3>
    <p>Heat oil in a deep pan or fryer to 350°F (175°C). Carefully place the lumpia in the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve the gluten-free lumpia hot with your favorite dipping sauce, such as sweet chili sauce or a gluten-free soy sauce blend. Enjoy the crispy, flavorful rolls as an appetizer, snack, or even a main dish.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Lumpia</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free lumpia offers several benefits, especially for those with dietary restrictions. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Safe for Gluten Intolerance:</strong> Gluten-free lumpia is safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, allowing them to enjoy a classic dish without worry.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthier Option:</strong> Using gluten-free wrappers often means fewer processed ingredients, making it a healthier choice for everyone.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> The filling can be customized to suit various dietary preferences, including vegetarian or vegan options.</li>
