    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Catfish</h3>
    <p>Start by rinsing the catfish fillets under cold water and patting them dry with paper towels. This step ensures that the coating adheres properly to the fish.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Create the Coating Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a shallow dish, combine the gluten-free flour, cornmeal, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to ensure the spices are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Egg Wash</h3>
    <p>In another shallow dish, whisk together the eggs and milk. This mixture will help the coating stick to the catfish fillets.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Coat the Catfish</h3>
    <p>Dip each catfish fillet into the egg wash, allowing any excess to drip off. Then, dredge the fillet in the flour mixture, pressing gently to ensure an even coating. Repeat the process for all fillets.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fry the Catfish</h3>
    <p>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot (around 350°F), carefully place the coated catfish fillets into the skillet. Fry for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until the coating is golden brown and the fish is cooked through. Avoid overcrowding the skillet to ensure even cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Drain and Serve</h3>
    <p>Remove the fried catfish from the skillet and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil. Serve immediately with your favorite sides, such as coleslaw, hushpuppies, or a fresh salad.</p>

    <p>Choosing gluten-free fried catfish offers several benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Digestive Health:</strong> For individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, avoiding gluten can prevent digestive discomfort and promote gut health.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich:</strong> Catfish is a good source of protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and essential vitamins and minerals. Pairing it with gluten-free ingredients ensures a nutritious meal.</li>
