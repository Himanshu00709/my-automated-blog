    <h1>Gluten-Free Roti Near Me: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, especially among individuals with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or those simply opting for a healthier lifestyle. One of the most sought-after gluten-free alternatives is the gluten-free roti, a staple in many South Asian households. If you're on the hunt for "gluten-free roti near me," this guide will provide you with everything you need to know, from where to find it to how to make it at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Roti?</h2>

    <p>Roti, a traditional flatbread, is a dietary staple in many South Asian countries. Traditionally made from wheat flour, roti contains gluten, which can be problematic for those with gluten-related disorders. Gluten-free roti, on the other hand, is made from alternative flours such as rice flour, chickpea flour (besan), or millet flour. These flours are naturally gluten-free and provide a safe and delicious alternative for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Roti?</h2>

    <p>Choosing gluten-free roti can be beneficial for several reasons:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and even long-term damage to the intestines. Gluten-free roti eliminates these risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Many gluten-free flours used in roti, such as chickpea flour, are rich in protein, fiber, and essential nutrients, making them a healthier option compared to traditional wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Dietary Preferences:</strong> Even if you don't have a gluten intolerance, opting for gluten-free roti can be a part of a balanced diet, especially if you're looking to reduce your gluten intake.</li>
    </ul>
