    <h1>Gluten-Free Ham Dinner: A Delicious and Healthy Feast</h1>
    <p>When it comes to hosting a dinner that caters to both taste and dietary restrictions, a gluten-free ham dinner is an excellent choice. Whether you're cooking for someone with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply aiming for a healthier meal, this guide will walk you through creating a memorable and safe gluten-free ham dinner. From selecting the right ingredients to preparing a flavorful meal, we’ve got you covered.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Ham Dinner?</h2>
    <p>Ham is naturally gluten-free, making it a fantastic centerpiece for a gluten-free meal. However, the key to a successful gluten-free ham dinner lies in the preparation and the accompanying dishes. Cross-contamination and hidden gluten in sauces or seasonings can be a concern, so it’s essential to be mindful of every ingredient used. A gluten-free ham dinner is not only safe for those with gluten intolerance but also a delicious option for everyone at the table.</p>

    <h2>Selecting the Perfect Ham</h2>
    <p>When choosing a ham for your gluten-free dinner, opt for a fresh, uncured ham or a pre-cooked ham that is labeled gluten-free. Many pre-packaged hams are processed with gluten-containing ingredients, so always check the label. Here’s a quick guide to help you select the right ham:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Type of Ham</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
                <th>Tips</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Fresh Ham</td>
                <td>Naturally Gluten-Free</td>
                <td>Ensure no gluten-containing additives are used during processing.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pre-Cooked Ham</td>
                <td>Check Label</td>
                <td>Look for "gluten-free" certification to avoid hidden gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Spiral-Cut Ham</td>
                <td>Check Label</td>
                <td>Some spiral-cut hams may contain gluten in the glaze or seasoning.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Preparing the Gluten-Free Ham</h2>
    <p>Once you’ve selected your ham, the next step is preparation. If you’re using a pre-cooked ham, you’ll need to reheat it properly. For fresh ham, you’ll need to cook it thoroughly. Here’s a simple method to prepare your gluten-free ham:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven</strong> to 325°F (165°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Score the ham</strong> by making shallow cuts in a diamond pattern on the surface. This allows the glaze to penetrate the meat.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the glaze</strong> using gluten-free ingredients like honey, brown sugar, mustard, and apple cider vinegar. Avoid store-bought glazes unless they are certified gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the ham</strong> for about 15-20 minutes per pound, basting with the glaze every 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it rest</strong> for 15-20 minutes before carving to allow the juices to redistribute.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Side Dishes to Complement Your Ham</h2>
    <p>No ham dinner is complete without a variety of side dishes. Here are some gluten-free options that pair perfectly with ham:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Side Dish</th>
                <th>Ingredients</th>
                <th>Preparation Tips</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Mashed Potatoes</td>
                <td>Potatoes, butter, milk, salt, pepper</td>
                <td>Use gluten-free butter and milk. Avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing utensils.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Roasted Vegetables</td>
                <td>Carrots, Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, olive oil, herbs</td>
                <td>Toss vegetables in olive oil and roast at 400°F (200°C) for 25-30 minutes.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Gluten-Free Stuffing</td>
                <td>Gluten-free bread, celery, onions, herbs, chicken broth</td>
                <td>Use certified gluten-free bread and broth. Bake until golden brown.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Green Bean Casserole</td>
                <td>Green beans, gluten-free cream of mushroom soup, fried onions</td>
                <td>Ensure all ingredients are gluten-free. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 25 minutes.</td>
            </tr>
