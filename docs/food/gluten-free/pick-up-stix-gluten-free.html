    <h1>Pick Up Stix Gluten-Free Options: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free dining options has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the growing popularity of gluten-free diets. For those who love Asian cuisine, finding a restaurant that offers delicious and safe gluten-free options can be a challenge.

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining</h2>

    <p>Before diving into Pick Up Stix’s gluten-free options, it’s essential to understand what “gluten-free” means. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.
