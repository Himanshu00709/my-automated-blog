<h1>Gluten-Free Risotto: A Culinary Delight</h1>

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Risotto</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free risotto is a straightforward process that requires patience and attention to detail. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Broth:</strong> Heat your gluten-free broth in a separate pot and keep it warm. This ensures that the rice cooks evenly and absorbs the flavors.</li>
    <li><strong>Sauté the Aromatics:</strong> In a large pan, melt butter or heat olive oil over medium heat. Add finely chopped onions or shallots and sauté until translucent.</li>
    <li><strong>Toast the Rice:</strong> Add the Arborio rice to the pan and toast it for a couple of minutes until the edges become slightly translucent. This step helps the rice absorb the broth better.</li>
    <li><strong>Deglaze with Wine:</strong> Pour in a splash of gluten-free white wine and stir until it’s absorbed by the rice. The wine adds depth to the flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Broth Gradually:</strong> Begin adding the warm broth, one ladle at a time, stirring constantly. Allow the liquid to be absorbed before adding more. This process should take about 18-20 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Finish with Cheese and Seasonings:</strong> Once the rice is creamy and al dente, stir in grated Parmesan cheese and season with salt, pepper, and herbs to taste.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve Immediately:</strong> Risotto is best enjoyed fresh. Serve it hot, garnished with additional Parmesan or fresh herbs if desired.</li>
</ol>
