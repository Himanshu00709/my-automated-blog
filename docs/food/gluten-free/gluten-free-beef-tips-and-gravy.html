    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Beef</h3>
    <p>Start by cutting the beef sirloin tips into bite-sized pieces. Season them generously with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the beef tips and sear them on all sides until they are browned. This step is crucial for developing deep flavor in the dish. Once browned, remove the beef from the skillet and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Aromatics</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the diced onion and minced garlic. Sauté them until they are softened and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes. The onions will pick up the flavorful bits left from the beef, adding depth to the gravy.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Gravy</h3>
    <p>Sprinkle the gluten-free flour over the onions and garlic, stirring to coat them evenly. Cook for 1-2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste. Slowly pour in the gluten-free beef broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Add the Worcestershire sauce and fresh herbs, then bring the mixture to a simmer. The gravy will begin to thicken as it cooks.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine and Simmer</h3>
    <p>Return the beef tips to the skillet, stirring to coat them in the gravy. Reduce the heat to low and let the dish simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the beef is tender and the gravy has reached your desired consistency. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve the gluten-free beef tips and gravy over mashed potatoes, rice, or gluten-free pasta. Garnish with fresh herbs if desired, and enjoy a comforting, gluten-free meal that’s sure to satisfy.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Beef Tips and Gravy</h2>
    <p>This dish is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. Beef is an excellent source of protein, iron, and B vitamins, which are essential for energy production and overall health. By using gluten-free flour and broth, you can enjoy this meal without the digestive discomfort that gluten can cause for some individuals. Additionally, the use of fresh herbs adds antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties to the dish.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute beef with chicken, pork, or even mushrooms for a vegetarian version. Adjust the cooking time accordingly to ensure the meat is fully cooked.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free flour on hand, you can use cornstarch or arrowroot powder as a thickening agent. Mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of cold water and stir it into the gravy.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in the microwave, adding a splash of broth if the gravy has thickened too much.</p>

        <h3>Is Worcestershire sauce always gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Not all Worcestershire sauces are gluten-free, so be sure to check the label. Look for brands that specifically state they are gluten-free, or use tamari sauce as a substitute.</p>
