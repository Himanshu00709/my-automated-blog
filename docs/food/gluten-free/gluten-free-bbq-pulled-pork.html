    <h1>Gluten-Free BBQ Pulled Pork: A Flavorful Guide</h1>
    <p>Barbecue pulled pork is a classic comfort food that brings people together. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this dish can be a challenge due to the hidden gluten in many BBQ sauces and seasonings. The good news? You don’t have to miss out! With the right ingredients and techniques, you can create a mouthwatering gluten-free BBQ pulled pork that’s safe and delicious for everyone. In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know to make the perfect gluten-free pulled pork, from selecting the right cut of meat to crafting a gluten-free BBQ sauce.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free with BBQ Pulled Pork?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can sneak into many foods, including BBQ sauces, rubs, and even some spice blends. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, fatigue, and long-term damage to the small intestine. By opting for gluten-free BBQ pulled pork, you can enjoy this beloved dish without compromising your health or taste buds.</p>

    <h2>Choosing the Right Cut of Pork</h2>
    <p>The key to tender, flavorful pulled pork lies in selecting the right cut of meat. Pork shoulder (also known as Boston butt) is the most popular choice for pulled pork because it’s well-marbled with fat, which keeps the meat moist during the long cooking process. Here’s a quick comparison of pork cuts:</p>

    <table>

            <tr>
                <th>Cut of Pork</th>
