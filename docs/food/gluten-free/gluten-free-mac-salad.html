    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Gluten-Free Pasta</h3>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Add the diced celery, finely chopped red onion, grated carrot, and chopped parsley to the dressing. Stir until the vegetables are evenly coated with the dressing.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Pasta and Dressing</h3>
    <p>Add the cooled gluten-free pasta to the bowl with the dressing and vegetables. Gently toss everything together until the pasta is well coated with the dressing and the vegetables are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Cover the mac salad and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld together. Before serving, give the salad a final stir and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Serve chilled and enjoy!</p>
