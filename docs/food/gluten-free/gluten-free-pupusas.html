    <h1>Gluten-Free Pupusas: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>Pupusas, a traditional Salvadoran dish, have gained popularity worldwide for their delicious taste and versatility. These thick, handmade corn tortillas are typically stuffed with a variety of fillings, such as cheese, beans, and meats. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying traditional pupusas can be a challenge due to the presence of gluten in some recipes. Enter gluten-free pupusas—a healthier and equally delicious alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this beloved dish without compromising their dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>What Are Pupusas?</h2>
    <p>Pupusas are a staple in Salvadoran cuisine, often referred to as the national dish of El Salvador. They are made from masa harina, a type of corn flour, and are typically filled with a combination of ingredients such as cheese, refried beans, and chicharrón (pork). The dough is shaped into a thick tortilla, stuffed with the desired filling, and then cooked on a griddle until golden brown. Pupusas are traditionally served with curtido, a tangy cabbage slaw, and tomato salsa.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of health issues, including digestive problems, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free alternatives to enjoy their favorite foods without the adverse effects. Gluten-free pupusas are an excellent option for those looking to maintain a gluten-free diet while still indulging in the rich flavors of traditional Salvadoran cuisine.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Pupusas</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free pupusas is relatively simple, especially if you're already familiar with the traditional recipe. The key difference lies in the choice of flour. Instead of using regular masa harina, which may contain traces of gluten, opt for certified gluten-free masa harina. Here's a step-by-step guide to making gluten-free pupusas at home:</p>

                <td>1/2 teaspoon</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Filling of choice (e.g., cheese, beans, pork)</td>
                <td>1 cup</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Oil (for cooking)</td>
                <td>2 tablespoons</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free masa harina, salt, and warm water. Mix until a soft dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add a little more water; if it's too sticky, add a bit more masa harina.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Pupusas:</strong> Divide the dough into equal-sized balls, about the size of a golf ball. Flatten each ball into a small disc, then place a spoonful of your chosen filling in the center. Fold the edges of the dough over the filling and seal it, then gently flatten the filled dough into a thick tortilla shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pupusas:</strong> Heat a griddle or skillet over medium heat and lightly grease it with oil. Cook each pupusa for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the pupusas hot with curtido and salsa on the side.</li>
    </ol>
