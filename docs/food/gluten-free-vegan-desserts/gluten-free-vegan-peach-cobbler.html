<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Peach Filling</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Peel and slice the peaches, then place them in a large mixing bowl. Add the maple syrup, lemon juice, and vanilla extract to the peaches. Gently toss the mixture until the peaches are evenly coated. Set aside while you prepare the topping.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, rolled oats, coconut sugar, baking powder, and cinnamon. Mix well to ensure all the dry ingredients are evenly distributed. Next, add the melted coconut oil and almond milk to the dry mixture. Stir until a crumbly dough forms. If the mixture is too dry, you can add a splash more almond milk.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>

<p>Transfer the peach mixture to a baking dish, spreading it out evenly. Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler topping over the peaches, covering as much surface area as possible. Don’t worry if it’s not perfect—this rustic look is part of the charm! Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the peaches are bubbling.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Once the cobbler is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Serve warm, optionally with a scoop of vegan vanilla ice cream or a dollop of coconut whipped cream. Enjoy the perfect balance of sweet, tangy, and crumbly textures in every bite!</p>

<h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Vegan Peach Cobbler</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use ripe peaches:</strong> The sweetness and juiciness of ripe peaches are key to a flavorful cobbler. If your peaches aren’t quite ripe, let them sit at room temperature for a day or two.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust sweetness:</strong> Depending on your preference, you can adjust the amount of maple syrup or coconut sugar. Taste the peach mixture before baking and add more sweetener if needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with toppings:</strong> Feel free to add nuts like almonds or pecans to the topping for extra crunch and flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen peaches instead of fresh ones?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen peaches if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in the cobbler.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of coconut oil?</h3>
    <p>You can substitute coconut oil with other plant-based oils like olive oil or avocado oil. Alternatively, you can use vegan butter for a richer flavor.</p>

    <h3>Is this recipe suitable for nut allergies?</h3>
    <p>If you have a nut allergy, ensure that the gluten-free flour you use is nut-free (e.g., oat flour or rice flour). Also, use a nut-free plant-based milk like oat milk or soy milk.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this cobbler ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the peach filling and topping separately and store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before assembling and baking. This makes it a convenient dessert for gatherings.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This gluten-free vegan peach cobbler is a testament to the fact that dietary restrictions don’t have to mean sacrificing flavor or indulgence. With its juicy peach filling and crumbly, golden topping, this dessert is sure to become a favorite in your household. Whether you’re hosting a dinner party or simply craving a sweet treat, this cobbler is easy to make and even easier to enjoy. So grab those peaches and get baking—your taste buds will thank you!</p>
