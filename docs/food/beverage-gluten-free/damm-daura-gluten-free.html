    <h1>Damm Daura Gluten-Free Beer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and the beer industry is no exception. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding a beer that is both safe and enjoyable can be a challenge. Enter Damm Daura, a gluten-free beer that has been making waves in the market. In this article, we will delve into the world of Damm Daura, exploring its origins, brewing process, nutritional profile, and why it stands out in the crowded gluten-free beer market.</p>

    <h2>What is Damm Daura?</h2>

    <p>Damm Daura is a gluten-free beer produced by the Spanish brewery, Damm. It was specifically crafted to cater to individuals who suffer from celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Unlike many other gluten-free beers that are made from alternative grains like sorghum or rice, Damm Daura is brewed from barley and then undergoes a process to remove the gluten, making it safe for those with gluten-related disorders.</p>

    <h2>The Brewing Process</h2>

    <p>The brewing process of Damm Daura is a fascinating blend of traditional brewing techniques and modern technology. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Step</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>1. Malting</td>
                <td>Barley grains are soaked in water and allowed to germinate. This process activates enzymes that convert the grain's starches into fermentable sugars.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2. Mashing</td>
                <td>The malted barley is mixed with hot water to create a mash. This step extracts the sugars, which will later be fermented into alcohol.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3. Boiling</td>
                <td>The mash is boiled, and hops are added for flavor and aroma. Hops also act as a natural preservative.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4. Fermentation</td>
                <td>The boiled liquid, now called wort, is cooled and transferred to fermentation tanks. Yeast is added, and the fermentation process begins, converting sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5. Gluten Removal</td>
                <td>After fermentation, the beer undergoes a specialized process to remove gluten. This involves the use of enzymes that break down gluten proteins into smaller fragments that are safe for those with gluten intolerance.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>6. Filtration and Packaging</td>
                <td>The beer is filtered to remove any remaining solids and then packaged into bottles or cans, ready for distribution.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
