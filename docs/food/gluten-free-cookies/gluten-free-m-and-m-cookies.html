    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free M&M cookies is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create your own batch of delicious cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugars:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the egg and vanilla:</strong> Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the M&Ms:</strong> Gently fold in the M&M candies until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free M&M cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough:</strong> If you have time, chilling the dough for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with add-ins:</strong> Feel free to add other mix-ins like chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruit to customize your cookies.</li>
    </ul>
