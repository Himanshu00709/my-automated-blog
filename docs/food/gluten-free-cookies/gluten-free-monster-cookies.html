    <h1>Gluten-Free Monster Cookies: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>Monster cookies are a beloved treat for many, combining the best of both worlds: the chewiness of oatmeal cookies and the richness of chocolate chips, M&Ms, and peanut butter. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional monster cookies are off the table. Enter gluten-free monster cookies—a delicious and inclusive alternative that doesn’t compromise on taste or texture. In this blog post, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free monster cookies, from their ingredients to their health benefits, and even provide a step-by-step recipe to make them at home.</p>

By substituting traditional flour with gluten-free alternatives like almond flour, oat flour, or a gluten-free flour blend, these cookies become a safe and enjoyable treat for everyone.</p>
