    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Butterscotch Cookies</h2>

    <p>Now that we’ve covered the key ingredients, let’s walk through the process of making these delicious cookies:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and ensure even baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. This ensures that the leavening agent is evenly distributed throughout the dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving the right texture in your cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Make sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined. Overmixing can lead to tough cookies, so be gentle.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in Butterscotch Chips</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the butterscotch chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Space them about 2 inches apart to allow for spreading. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your delicious gluten-free butterscotch cookies!</p>
