<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Cannoli at Home</h2>

<p>If you're feeling adventurous, why not try making gluten-free cannoli at home? Here's a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 cup gluten-free flour blend</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold and cubed</li>
    <li>1 egg yolk</li>
    <li>2-3 tablespoons white wine or water</li>
    <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/4 cup mini chocolate chips (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, sugar, and salt. Cut in the cold butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
    <li>Add the egg yolk and 2 tablespoons of white wine or water. Mix until the dough comes together. If the dough is too dry, add more liquid, one teaspoon at a time.</li>
    <li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into 4-inch circles.</li>
    <li>Wrap each circle around a cannoli mold and seal the edges with a bit of water. Place on a baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool completely before removing from the molds.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth. Stir in the chocolate chips if using.</li>
    <li>Fill a piping bag with the ricotta mixture and pipe into the cooled cannoli shells. Dust with powdered sugar before serving.</li>
</ol>
