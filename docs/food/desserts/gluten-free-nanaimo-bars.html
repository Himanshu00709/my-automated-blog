    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free Nanaimo bars is a straightforward process, but it does require some patience as each layer needs time to set. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating this delectable dessert:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Base</h3>
    <p>Start by crushing gluten-free graham crackers into fine crumbs.

    <h3>2. Make the Custard Filling</h3>

    <h3>3. Add the Chocolate Topping</h3>
    <p>Melt dark chocolate and butter together in a double boiler or microwave, stirring until smooth. Pour the melted chocolate over the custard layer, spreading it evenly. Allow the bars to chill in the refrigerator until the chocolate is firm.</p>

    <h3>4. Cut and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once fully set, remove the bars from the refrigerator and cut them into squares or rectangles. Serve chilled and enjoy!</p>
