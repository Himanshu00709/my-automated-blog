    <h1>Gluten-Free Blizzard Flavors: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding delicious and safe dessert options can be a challenge. Dairy Queen’s Blizzard treats are a beloved indulgence, but navigating the gluten-free options can be tricky. In this guide, we’ll explore the gluten-free Blizzard flavors available, how to ensure your treat is safe, and some tips for enjoying your dessert without worry.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Diets</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. A gluten-free diet eliminates all sources of gluten, which means carefully reading labels and being aware of cross-contamination risks.</p>
