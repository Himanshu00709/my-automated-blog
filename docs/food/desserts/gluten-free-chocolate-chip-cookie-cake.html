<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making your gluten-free chocolate chip cookie cake.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugars</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
<p>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cake.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Fold in Chocolate Chips</h3>
<p>Gently fold in the gluten-free chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Bake</h3>
<p>Spread the batter evenly into the prepared cake pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>Step 8: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and serve with your favorite toppings, such as whipped cream or a drizzle of chocolate sauce.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookie Cake</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>If you don’t need to avoid gluten, you can certainly use regular all-purpose flour in this recipe. However, if you’re baking for someone with celiac disease or a gluten sensitivity, it’s important to stick with gluten-free flour to ensure the cake is safe for them to eat.</p>

    <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour to use?</h3>
    <p>There are many gluten-free flour blends available, but for this recipe, a 1:1 gluten-free all-purpose flour blend works best. These blends are designed to mimic the texture and consistency of regular flour, making them ideal for baking.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make this cake dairy-free by substituting the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or a plant-based butter. Just be sure to check that your chocolate chips are also dairy-free.</p>

    <h3>How should I store the cookie cake?</h3>
    <p>Store the cookie cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. If you need to store it longer, you can refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>
