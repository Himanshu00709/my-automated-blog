    <h1>Gluten-Free Figgy Pudding: A Delicious Holiday Tradition</h1>
    <p>When the holiday season rolls around, few desserts evoke the warmth and nostalgia of figgy pudding. This traditional British dessert, often associated with Christmas, has been enjoyed for centuries. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic treat can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free figgy pudding—a delightful adaptation that allows everyone to partake in this festive tradition. In this article, we’ll explore the history of figgy pudding, how to make a gluten-free version, and why it’s a must-try for your holiday table.</p>

    <h2>The History of Figgy Pudding</h2>
    <p>Figgy pudding, also known as plum pudding, has its roots in medieval England. Despite its name, the dessert traditionally contains no plums. Instead, it’s a rich, dense cake filled with dried fruits, spices, and sometimes alcohol. The term "figgy" refers to the inclusion of figs, which were a common ingredient in early recipes. Over time, figgy pudding became synonymous with Christmas, thanks in part to its mention in the popular carol "We Wish You a Merry Christmas," which famously demands, "Now bring us some figgy pudding!"</p>

    <p>Traditionally, figgy pudding is made with wheat flour, which poses a problem for those avoiding gluten. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets, many bakers have adapted the recipe to accommodate these dietary needs without sacrificing flavor or texture.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Figgy Pudding</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free figgy pudding is easier than you might think. The key is to use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend that mimics the texture of wheat flour. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating this holiday classic:</p>
