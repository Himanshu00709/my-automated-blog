<h1>Gluten-Free Sugar-Free Cheesecake: A Healthy Indulgence</h1>

<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Crust</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, combine 1 ½ cups of almond flour with ½ cup of melted unsalted butter. Mix until the ingredients are well combined and the mixture resembles wet sand. Press this mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, ensuring an even layer. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

<h3>2. Making the Filling</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, beat 24 oz of cream cheese until it’s smooth and creamy. Gradually add 1 cup of erythritol or stevia, continuing to beat until the mixture is well combined. Add 3 large eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tbsp of lemon juice. Finally, fold in ½ cup of heavy cream until the mixture is smooth and uniform.</p>

<h3>3. Baking the Cheesecake</h3>

<p>Pour the filling over the cooled crust in the springform pan. Smooth the top with a spatula. Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center is still slightly wobbly. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door slightly ajar for about an hour. This helps prevent cracking. Once cooled, refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours, or overnight, before serving.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Sugar-Free Cheesecake</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different flour for the crust?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or oat flour. However, the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>2. What can I use instead of erythritol or stevia?</h3>
    <p>Other sugar substitutes like monk fruit sweetener or xylitol can be used. Be sure to adjust the quantity based on the sweetness level of the substitute.</p>

    <h3>3. How do I store the cheesecake?</h3>
    <p>Store the cheesecake in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze it for up to 2 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before serving.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I add toppings to the cheesecake?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Fresh berries, sugar-free chocolate sauce, or a dollop of whipped cream make excellent toppings. Just ensure any toppings are also gluten-free and sugar-free if you’re adhering to those dietary restrictions.</p>
