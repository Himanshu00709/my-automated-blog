    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the batter.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream together the unsalted butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for creating a tender crumb in the cake.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla extract for added flavor.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined; overmixing can lead to a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>6. Fold in Crushed Oreos</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the crushed gluten-free Oreos. Be careful not to overmix, as you want to maintain the texture of the Oreo pieces.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>8. Frost and Decorate</h3>
    <p>Once the cakes are completely cool, frost them with your favorite gluten-free frosting. You can use a classic buttercream, cream cheese frosting, or even a whipped cream frosting. Decorate with additional crushed Oreos for an extra touch of indulgence.</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular Oreos in this recipe?</h3>
        <p>No, regular Oreos contain gluten. To keep the cake gluten-free, it's essential to use gluten-free Oreos or a similar gluten-free chocolate sandwich cookie.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>2. What gluten-free flour blend works best for this cake?</h3>
        <p>A blend of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch works well for most gluten-free baking. However, you can use any high-quality gluten-free flour blend that you prefer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>3. Can I make this cake dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and use a dairy-free milk in place of buttermilk. Just ensure that all your ingredients are dairy-free.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>4. How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. If you’re using a frosting that requires refrigeration, it’s best to keep the cake chilled.</p>
    </div>
