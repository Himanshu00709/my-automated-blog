    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making mini gluten-free apple pies:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by making the gluten-free pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and cold butter. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Apple Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the apple filling. In a large bowl, toss the diced apples with sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Mix well to ensure the apples are evenly coated. Set aside to let the flavors meld while you roll out the dough.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Mini Pies</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Use a round cookie cutter or a glass to cut out circles of dough. Press each circle into the cavities of a mini muffin tin, making sure to press the dough up the sides. Fill each crust with the apple mixture, being careful not to overfill.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, beat the egg and brush it over the edges of the pie crusts. This will give them a beautiful golden color when baked. Place the mini pies in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Allow the pies to cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Mini Gluten-Free Apple Pies</h2>
    <p>Making mini gluten-free apple pies can be a bit tricky, especially if you’re new to gluten-free baking. Here are some tips to help you achieve the best results:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that contains xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep the dough cold:</strong> Gluten-free dough can be more fragile than traditional dough, so it’s important to keep it cold throughout the process. If the dough becomes too soft, pop it back in the fridge for a few minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overfill the pies:</strong> Overfilling can cause the pies to spill over during baking, making them messy and difficult to remove from the tin. Fill each crust about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with spices:</strong> While cinnamon and nutmeg are classic choices, feel free to experiment with other spices like cardamom, allspice, or even a pinch of cloves for a unique flavor profile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these pies ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the mini gluten-free apple pies ahead of time. Once baked and cooled, store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months. Simply reheat in the oven before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While apples are the classic choice, you can use other fruits like pears, peaches, or even berries. Just adjust the sugar and spices accordingly to complement the fruit you choose.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best way to serve mini gluten-free apple pies?</h3>
        <p>These mini pies are delicious on their own, but you can take them to the next level by serving them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a dollop of whipped cream, or a drizzle of caramel sauce. They’re also great with a cup of coffee or tea.</p>
    </div>
