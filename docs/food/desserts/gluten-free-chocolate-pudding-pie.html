    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free chocolate pudding pie:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> If you're using a store-bought gluten-free pie crust, follow the package instructions for pre-baking. If you're making your own, combine gluten-free flour, butter, and a pinch of salt, then press into a pie dish and bake until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Pudding:</strong> In a medium saucepan, whisk together the cocoa powder, cornstarch, and sugar. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Cook over medium heat, stirring continuously, until the mixture thickens and comes to a gentle boil.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Egg Yolks:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks. Slowly add a small amount of the hot pudding mixture to the yolks, whisking constantly to temper them. Then, pour the yolk mixture back into the saucepan and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish the Pudding:</strong> Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla extract until fully incorporated. Let the pudding cool slightly before pouring it into the prepared pie crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Pie:</strong> Refrigerate the pie for at least 4 hours, or until the pudding is fully set. Before serving, top with whipped cream and additional chocolate shavings if desired.</li>
    </ol>

If you opt for a dairy-free milk alternative, you can also make this pie suitable for those with lactose intolerance.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this pie dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make this pie dairy-free by substituting the whole milk with a dairy-free alternative like almond milk or oat milk. Additionally, use a dairy-free butter substitute and ensure your whipped cream is also dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How long does the pie last in the fridge?</h3>

        <h3>What can I use instead of cornstarch?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use cornstarch, you can substitute it with an equal amount of arrowroot powder or tapioca starch. Both will work as effective thickeners for the pudding.</p>
