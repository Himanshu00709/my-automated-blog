    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these detailed steps to create your gluten-free chocolate peanut butter cake:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans with gluten-free flour to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure there are no lumps.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined. Stir in the hot water to thin the batter slightly.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>6. Prepare the Peanut Butter Frosting</h3>
    <p>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the frosting. In a medium bowl, beat the peanut butter, powdered sugar, and heavy cream until smooth and creamy. Adjust the consistency by adding more cream if needed.</p>

    <h3>7. Assemble the Cake</h3>
    <p>Once the cakes are completely cool, spread a layer of peanut butter frosting on top of one cake layer. Place the second layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. Decorate as desired.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Baking</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free can be tricky, but with these tips, you’ll achieve a perfect cake every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend specifically designed for baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free cakes may bake faster than traditional cakes. Start checking for doneness a few minutes before the recommended baking time.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Cake Cool Completely:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be more fragile when warm. Allow them to cool completely before frosting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour can be used, but it will change the texture of the cake. It’s best to use a gluten-free flour blend designed for baking to achieve the desired texture.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil, and use a dairy-free milk in place of buttermilk. Ensure the chocolate and peanut butter are also dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Bring to room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I freeze the cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the unfrosted cake layers for up to 3 months. Wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil. Thaw at room temperature before frosting and serving.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>A gluten-free chocolate peanut butter cake is a delightful dessert that combines rich, indulgent flavors with the dietary needs of those avoiding gluten. With the right ingredients and techniques, you can create a cake that is moist, flavorful, and sure to impress. Whether you’re baking for a special occasion or simply satisfying a sweet craving, this cake is a perfect choice. Happy baking!</p>
