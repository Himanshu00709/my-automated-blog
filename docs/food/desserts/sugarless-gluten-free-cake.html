    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Baking a Sugarless Gluten-Free Cake</h2>
    <p>Baking a sugarless gluten-free cake is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a moist, flavorful cake that everyone will love:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease your cake pan with a little coconut oil or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of almond flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Whisk these dry ingredients together to ensure even distribution.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix 3 eggs (or flaxseed meal equivalent), 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce, and 1/2 cup of stevia or erythritol. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Avoid overmixing to keep the cake light and fluffy.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with fresh berries or a dollop of whipped cream for added flavor.</p>
