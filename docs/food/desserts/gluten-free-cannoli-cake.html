    <h1>Gluten-Free Cannoli Cake: A Delicious Twist on a Classic Dessert</h1>
    <p>When it comes to desserts, few can resist the allure of a cannoli. This iconic Italian treat, with its crispy shell and creamy ricotta filling, has been a favorite for generations.

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Cannoli Cake?</h2>
