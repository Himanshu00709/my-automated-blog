    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Cookie Dough for Ice Cream</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free cookie dough is surprisingly simple, and the process is quite similar to making traditional cookie dough. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Before you start, ensure you have all the necessary ingredients. Double-check that your flour and other components are certified gluten-free to avoid any cross-contamination.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, combine your gluten-free flour, a pinch of salt, and any other dry ingredients like baking soda or baking powder. Whisk them together to ensure even distribution.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving the right texture in your cookie dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs and vanilla extract until well combined. If you’re using a flax egg, make sure it’s properly prepared before adding it to the mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a tough dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in the Chocolate Chips</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the gluten-free chocolate chips or chunks. You can also add other mix-ins like nuts or dried fruit if desired.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Chill the Dough</h3>
    <p>For the best results, chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. This helps the dough firm up and makes it easier to handle when mixing into ice cream.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Incorporate into Ice Cream</h3>
    <p>Once your dough is ready, you can mix it into your favorite gluten-free ice cream base. Simply fold in small chunks of the dough until evenly distributed, then freeze according to your ice cream maker’s instructions.</p>
