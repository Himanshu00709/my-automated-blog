    <h2>What Makes Snickers Ice Cream Bars Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Snickers Ice Cream Bars are made with a combination of high-quality ingredients that are carefully selected to ensure they are free from gluten. The key components include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vanilla Ice Cream:</strong> Made from milk, cream, sugar, and natural vanilla flavor, the ice cream base is naturally gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Caramel Swirl:</strong> The gooey caramel layer is made from sugar, corn syrup, skim milk, and other natural flavors, all of which are gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Peanuts:</strong> Roasted peanuts add a satisfying crunch and are naturally gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate Coating:</strong> The rich chocolate coating is made from cocoa butter, milk, and sugar, ensuring it’s free from gluten-containing ingredients.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It’s important to note that while the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing.
