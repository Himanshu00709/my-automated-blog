    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Cake?</h2>
    <p>A great gluten-free cake is more than just the absence of gluten. It should be moist, flavorful, and have a texture that rivals traditional cakes. Here are some key factors to consider when choosing a gluten-free cake:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Moisture:</strong> Gluten-free flours can sometimes result in dry cakes. Look for cakes that use ingredients like applesauce, yogurt, or extra eggs to maintain moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> The best gluten-free cakes use high-quality ingredients to enhance flavor. Think rich chocolate, fresh fruits, or aromatic spices.</li>
        <li><strong>Texture:</strong> A good gluten-free cake should have a tender crumb and not be overly dense or crumbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Just because it's gluten-free doesn't mean it can't be beautiful. Look for cakes with professional decoration and attention to detail.</li>
    </ul>
