    <h1>Gluten-Free Cookie Dough Ice Cream: A Delicious Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Ice cream is a universally loved dessert, and when you add cookie dough into the mix, it becomes an irresistible treat. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional cookie dough ice cream is off the menu. Enter gluten-free cookie dough ice cream—a delightful alternative that allows everyone to indulge without worry. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free cookie dough ice cream, from its ingredients to its health benefits, and even how to make it at home.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Cookie Dough Ice Cream Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Traditional cookie dough is made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Gluten-free cookie dough ice cream replaces wheat flour with gluten-free alternatives such as almond flour, oat flour, or rice flour. These substitutes not only make the dessert safe for those with gluten sensitivities but also add unique flavors and textures.</p>

    <h3>Common Gluten-Free Flours Used in Cookie Dough</h3>

            <tr>
                <th>Flour Type</th>
                <th>Flavor Profile</th>
                <th>Texture</th>

            <tr>
                <td>Almond Flour</td>
                <td>Nutty, slightly sweet</td>
                <td>Soft and crumbly</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Oat Flour</td>
                <td>Mild, slightly earthy</td>
                <td>Dense and chewy</td>
            </tr>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Cookie Dough Ice Cream</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free cookie dough ice cream isn’t just a treat for those with gluten sensitivities; it also offers several health benefits. For starters, gluten-free flours like almond and oat flour are rich in nutrients such as fiber, protein, and healthy fats. These ingredients can help stabilize blood sugar levels and promote digestive health. Additionally, many gluten-free ice cream brands use natural sweeteners like honey or maple syrup instead of refined sugar, making it a healthier option for everyone.</p>
