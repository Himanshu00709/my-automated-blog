    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Black Forest Cake</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free Black Forest Cake is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a show-stopping dessert:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Chocolate Cake Layers</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line two 9-inch round cake pans. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend and cocoa powder. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool completely before assembling.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Cherry Filling</h3>
    <p>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the cherry filling. If using fresh cherries, pit and halve them. If using canned cherries, drain them well. In a saucepan, combine the cherries with a little sugar and Kirsch (if using). Cook over medium heat until the cherries release their juices and the mixture thickens slightly. Let it cool completely.</p>

    <h3>3. Whip the Cream</h3>
    <p>In a chilled mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to over-whip, as the cream can become grainy. You can add a little sugar or vanilla extract for sweetness if desired.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Cake</h3>
    <p>Once the cake layers are completely cool, place one layer on a serving plate. Spread a layer of whipped cream over the top, followed by a layer of the cherry filling. Place the second cake layer on top and repeat the process. Finish by covering the entire cake with whipped cream and garnishing with chocolate shavings and fresh cherries.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Black Forest Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend, but make sure it contains xanthan gum or add it separately. This helps mimic the texture of gluten and prevents the cake from being too crumbly.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil and use a dairy-free whipped cream made from coconut milk or a plant-based cream.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 3 days. The whipped cream and cherries can make the cake soggy if left at room temperature for too long.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I freeze the cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cake layers before assembling. Wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 2 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before assembling.</p>
    </div>

Whether you’re celebrating a special occasion or simply indulging in a sweet treat, this gluten-free Black Forest Cake is sure to impress.
