    <h2>How to Make Dairy-Free Gluten-Free Ice Cream Sandwiches at Home</h2>

    <p>Making your own dairy-free, gluten-free ice cream sandwiches at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating this delightful treat:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Gluten-Free Cookies</h3>
    <p>Start by making your gluten-free cookies. You can use a pre-made gluten-free flour blend or make your own by combining almond flour, oat flour, and a binder like xanthan gum. Add your choice of sweetener, a bit of vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Mix until you have a dough, then shape into cookies and bake until golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Dairy-Free Ice Cream</h3>
    <p>While your cookies are cooling, prepare the dairy-free ice cream. You can use a store-bought dairy-free ice cream or make your own by blending coconut milk, your choice of sweetener, and any additional flavorings (like cocoa powder for chocolate ice cream or fresh fruit for a fruity twist). Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Sandwiches</h3>
    <p>Once your cookies are completely cooled and your ice cream is firm, it’s time to assemble the sandwiches. Place a scoop of ice cream on the flat side of one cookie, then press another cookie on top. Gently press down to spread the ice cream evenly. Repeat with the remaining cookies and ice cream.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Freeze and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Place the assembled sandwiches on a baking sheet and freeze for at least 2 hours, or until firm. Once frozen, wrap each sandwich individually in parchment paper or plastic wrap for easy storage. Enjoy your homemade dairy-free, gluten-free ice cream sandwiches whenever the craving strikes!</p>
