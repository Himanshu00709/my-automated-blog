    <h1>Gluten-Free Donuts: Order Online and Enjoy Guilt-Free Indulgence</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and for good reason. Whether you're managing celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply opting for a healthier lifestyle, gluten-free donuts have become a popular treat. The best part?

Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe health issues for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Even for those without these conditions, reducing gluten intake can lead to better digestion and overall health. Gluten-free donuts are made with alternative flours like almond, coconut, or rice flour, which not only make them safe for gluten-sensitive individuals but also add unique flavors and textures.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthier Ingredients:</strong> Many gluten-free donuts are made with whole, natural ingredients that are better for your body.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich in Nutrients:</strong> Alternative flours like almond and coconut are rich in nutrients, including healthy fats, fiber, and protein.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower in Calories:</strong> Some gluten-free donuts are lower in calories compared to traditional donuts, making them a better option for those watching their weight.</li>
        <li><strong>Diverse Flavors:</strong> The use of different flours and ingredients allows for a wide range of flavors, from classic vanilla to exotic matcha.</li>
