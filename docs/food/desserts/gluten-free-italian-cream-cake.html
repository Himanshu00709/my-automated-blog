    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Stir in the vanilla extract, shredded coconut, and chopped pecans.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the cake batter until just combined.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Once the cakes are completely cool, frost with cream cheese frosting and garnish with additional shredded coconut and chopped pecans if desired.</li>
    </ol>
