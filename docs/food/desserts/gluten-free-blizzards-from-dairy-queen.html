    <h2>How to Order a Gluten-Free Blizzard</h2>

    <p>When ordering a gluten-free Blizzard at Dairy Queen, communication is key. Here are some tips to ensure your treat is safe:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ask About Ingredients:</strong> Always ask the staff about the ingredients in the Blizzard flavor you’re interested in. Some mix-ins may contain gluten, even if the base ice cream does not.</li>
        <li><strong>Request a Clean Blender:</strong> Cross-contamination can occur if the blender used to make your Blizzard has previously been used to mix gluten-containing ingredients. Request that the staff use a clean blender to avoid this issue.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Gluten-Free Labels:</strong> Some Dairy Queen locations may have gluten-free labels on their menu or packaging. Look for these labels to ensure your Blizzard is safe to eat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Concerns</h2>

    <p>Cross-contamination is a significant concern for those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivities. Even if a Blizzard flavor is made with gluten-free ingredients, it can still be contaminated if prepared in an environment where gluten is present. Here are some steps you can take to minimize the risk:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Visit During Off-Peak Hours:</strong> Visiting Dairy Queen during less busy times can reduce the risk of cross-contamination, as the staff will have more time to clean equipment thoroughly.</li>
        <li><strong>Speak to the Manager:</strong> If you’re particularly concerned about cross-contamination, consider speaking to the manager. They may be able to take extra precautions to ensure your Blizzard is prepared safely.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider Pre-Packaged Options:</strong> Some Dairy Queen locations offer pre-packaged gluten-free desserts. These options are typically prepared in a controlled environment and may be a safer choice.</li>
    </ul>
