    <h1>Gluten-Free Irish Desserts: A Delicious Journey</h1>
    <p>When it comes to Irish cuisine, many people think of hearty stews, soda bread, and, of course, potatoes.

    <h2>Traditional Irish Desserts: A Brief Overview</h2>
    <p>Irish desserts are known for their simplicity and reliance on wholesome ingredients. Many traditional recipes have been passed down through generations, often featuring ingredients like oats, butter, cream, and fruits.

    <p>Irish Apple Cake is a beloved dessert that combines the sweetness of apples with the warmth of cinnamon and nutmeg. Traditionally made with wheat flour, this cake can be easily adapted by using a gluten-free flour blend.
