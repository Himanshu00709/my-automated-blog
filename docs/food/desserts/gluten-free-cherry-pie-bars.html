    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free cherry pie bars is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a dessert that will impress your family and friends:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour and granulated sugar. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your hands to blend the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until the dough comes together.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Press the Dough into the Pan</h3>
    <p>Press about two-thirds of the dough into the bottom of a greased 9x13-inch baking pan. Make sure to press it evenly so that it forms a solid crust. Bake the crust in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes, or until it is lightly golden.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Add the Cherry Filling</h3>
    <p>Once the crust is baked, remove it from the oven and spread the cherry pie filling evenly over the top. Crumble the remaining dough over the cherry filling, creating a streusel-like topping.</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Bars</h3>
    <p>Return the pan to the oven and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Allow the bars to cool completely before cutting them into squares.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the bars have cooled, dust them with powdered sugar if desired. Serve them as a dessert or snack, and enjoy the delicious combination of sweet cherries and buttery crust.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cherry Pie Bars</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh cherries instead of cherry pie filling?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh cherries if you prefer. Simply pit and chop the cherries, then cook them with a bit of sugar and cornstarch to create your own filling. This will give your bars a fresher, more natural flavor.</p>
        <h3>Can I make these bars ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Gluten-free cherry pie bars can be made a day or two in advance. Store them in an airtight container at room temperature, or refrigerate them if you prefer a firmer texture.</p>
        <h3>Are these bars suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe contains butter and eggs, so it is not vegan. However, you can make a vegan version by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using a flax egg or another egg substitute.</p>
        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free cherry pie bars?</h3>
        <p>Yes, these bars freeze well. Wrap them individually in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe container. They can be stored in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free cherry pie bars are a delightful and versatile dessert that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. With their buttery crust and sweet cherry filling, they are sure to become a favorite in your household.
