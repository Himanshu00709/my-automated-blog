    <h1>Gluten-Free Key Lime Pie: A Taste of Key West</h1>
    <p>Key lime pie is an iconic dessert that originated in the Florida Keys, particularly in Key West. Its tangy, creamy filling and crumbly crust make it a favorite among dessert lovers. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic treat can be a challenge. Enter the gluten-free key lime pie—a delicious alternative that captures the essence of Key West without compromising on flavor or texture. In this blog post, we’ll explore the history of key lime pie, the benefits of going gluten-free, and how to make your own gluten-free version at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Key Lime Pie</h2>
    <p>Key lime pie has a rich history that dates back to the late 19th century.

The pie was traditionally made with a graham cracker crust, but modern variations have introduced gluten-free alternatives to cater to dietary needs.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the crushed gluten-free graham crackers, melted butter, and sugar. Press the mixture firmly into a 9-inch pie dish, ensuring an even layer on the bottom and sides. Bake for 10 minutes, then let it cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Filling:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the Key lime juice, sweetened condensed milk, and egg yolks until smooth. Pour the mixture into the cooled crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Pie:</strong> Bake the pie for 15-20 minutes, or until the filling is set but still slightly jiggly in the center. Allow the pie to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Before serving, top the pie with whipped cream if desired. Garnish with lime zest or slices for an extra touch of flavor and presentation.</li>
    </ol>
