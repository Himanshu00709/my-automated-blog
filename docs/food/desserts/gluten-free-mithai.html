    <h1>Gluten-Free Mithai: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>Mithai, or Indian sweets, are an integral part of Indian culture and traditions. From festivals to weddings, no celebration is complete without a plate of delectable mithai. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying these traditional sweets can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free mithai—a delicious and healthy alternative that allows everyone to indulge in the sweetness of Indian festivities without compromising their health.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and other grains.

Going gluten-free is not just a trend; for many, it's a necessity.</p>

    <p>Traditional mithai often contains ingredients like maida (refined wheat flour) or semolina, which are high in gluten. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets, many Indian sweet makers and home cooks are now experimenting with gluten-free alternatives to create mithai that is just as delicious and satisfying.</p>
