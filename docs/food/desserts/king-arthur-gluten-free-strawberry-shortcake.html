<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the steps to create this delicious gluten-free strawberry shortcake.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. This will prevent the shortcakes from sticking and make cleanup easier.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the King Arthur Gluten-Free All-Purpose Flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in your batter.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Incorporate the Butter</h3>
<p>Cut the cold unsalted butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. This step is crucial for achieving a tender and flaky texture in your shortcakes.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, mix the milk and vanilla extract. Gradually add this mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Shape and Bake</h3>
<p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently pat it into a circle about 1 inch thick. Use a round cutter to cut out individual shortcakes and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the shortcakes are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Assemble the Shortcakes</h3>
<p>Once the shortcakes have cooled slightly, slice them in half horizontally. Layer the bottom half with fresh sliced strawberries and a dollop of whipped cream. Place the top half of the shortcake over the strawberries and cream, and finish with another dollop of whipped cream and a few more strawberry slices.</p>

<h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Strawberry Shortcake</h2>

<p>To ensure your gluten-free strawberry shortcake turns out perfectly every time, here are a few tips to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Cold Butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for creating a flaky texture in your shortcakes. If the butter is too warm, it will melt into the dough, resulting in a denser cake.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough shortcakes. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Fresh Strawberries:</strong> While you can use frozen strawberries in a pinch, fresh strawberries will give your shortcakes the best flavor and texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Customize Your Toppings:</strong> Feel free to get creative with your toppings. Add a drizzle of chocolate sauce, a sprinkle of nuts, or even a splash of liqueur for an adult twist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About King Arthur Gluten-Free Strawberry Shortcake</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
    <p>While you can experiment with other gluten-free flour blends, King Arthur’s blend is specifically formulated to mimic the texture and flavor of traditional flour. Using a different blend may alter the final result.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can easily make this recipe dairy-free by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using a non-dairy milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftover shortcakes?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover shortcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two days. If you’ve already assembled the shortcakes with strawberries and cream, it’s best to store them in the refrigerator and consume them within a day.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze the shortcakes?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked shortcakes for up to three months. Wrap them individually in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe bag. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>
