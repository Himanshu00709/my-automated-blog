    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a dairy and gluten-free trifle:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Sponge Cake</h3>
    <p>Start by baking or purchasing a gluten-free sponge cake. You can use almond flour or a gluten-free flour blend to make the cake. Once the cake is ready, cut it into small cubes or slices that will fit comfortably in your trifle dish.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Layer the Trifle</h3>
    <p>Begin layering your trifle by placing a layer of sponge cake cubes at the bottom of your trifle dish. Add a layer of custard on top of the cake, followed by a layer of fresh or frozen fruit. Repeat the layers until the dish is full, finishing with a layer of dairy-free whipped cream on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Optional Toppings</h3>
    <p>For added texture and flavor, consider sprinkling some chia seeds, chopped nuts, or gluten-free granola on top of the whipped cream. You can also garnish with fresh fruit or a drizzle of dairy-free chocolate sauce.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once your trifle is assembled, cover it and place it in the refrigerator to chill for at least an hour. This allows the flavors to meld together. When ready to serve, scoop out portions and enjoy!</p>
