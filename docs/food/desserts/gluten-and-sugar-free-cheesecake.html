    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the almond flour and melted butter. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, ensuring it is evenly distributed. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and let it cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Filling:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add the natural sweetener, continuing to beat until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract, lemon juice, and heavy cream until the mixture is smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Cheesecake:</strong> Pour the filling over the cooled crust. Smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center is still slightly jiggly. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door slightly open for 1 hour.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill and Serve:</strong> Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature. Once cooled, refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight, before serving. Slice and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
