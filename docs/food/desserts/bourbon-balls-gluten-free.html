<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free bourbon balls is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create your own delicious treats:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
<p>Start by crushing your gluten-free cookies or cake into fine crumbs. You can use a food processor or place the cookies in a zip-top bag and crush them with a rolling pin. If you’re using nuts, chop them finely and set them aside.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free crumbs, bourbon, powdered sugar, chopped nuts (if using), and vanilla extract. Mix everything together until the mixture is well combined and holds together when pressed. If the mixture is too dry, you can add a little more bourbon, one teaspoon at a time, until it reaches the desired consistency.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Form the Balls</h3>
<p>Using your hands, roll the mixture into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. If the mixture is too sticky, you can lightly dust your hands with powdered sugar to make rolling easier.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Coat the Balls</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, mix the unsweetened cocoa powder with a little powdered sugar. Roll each ball in the cocoa mixture until it’s evenly coated. Alternatively, you can dip the balls in melted chocolate for a richer flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Chill and Serve</h3>
<p>Place the coated bourbon balls in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour to firm up. Once chilled, they are ready to serve. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Bourbon Balls</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I make bourbon balls without alcohol?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make bourbon balls without alcohol by substituting the bourbon with bourbon extract or a non-alcoholic bourbon flavoring. Keep in mind that the flavor will be slightly different, but it will still be delicious.</p>

    <h3>2. Are bourbon balls safe for children?</h3>
    <p>Traditional bourbon balls contain alcohol, so they are not suitable for children. However, you can make a kid-friendly version by using bourbon extract or omitting the alcohol altogether.</p>

    <h3>3. How long do bourbon balls last?</h3>
    <p>Bourbon balls can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. If you want to keep them longer, you can freeze them for up to three months.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I use different types of nuts?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! While pecans and walnuts are the most commonly used nuts in bourbon balls, you can experiment with other nuts like almonds or hazelnuts for a different flavor profile.</p>

    <h3>5. Are bourbon balls gluten-free by default?</h3>
    <p>No, traditional bourbon balls are not gluten-free because they are typically made with cookies or cake crumbs that contain gluten. To make them gluten-free, you need to use certified gluten-free ingredients.</p>
