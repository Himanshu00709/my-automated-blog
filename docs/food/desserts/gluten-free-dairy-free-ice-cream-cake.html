<p>Now that you know the key ingredients, let’s dive into a simple yet delicious recipe for gluten-free dairy-free ice cream cake. This recipe is perfect for any occasion and can be customized to suit your taste preferences.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
    <li>1 cup dairy-free milk (e.g., almond, coconut, or oat milk)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup natural sweetener (e.g., maple syrup or agave nectar)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup coconut oil (melted)</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 pint dairy-free ice cream (flavor of your choice)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Cake Base:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the dairy-free milk, natural sweetener, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until well combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake the Cake:</strong> Pour the batter into a greased 9-inch round cake pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool completely.</li>
    <li><strong>Assemble the Ice Cream Cake:</strong> Once the cake has cooled, remove it from the pan and place it on a serving plate. Soften the dairy-free ice cream slightly and spread it evenly over the top of the cake. You can also add a layer of fruit or chocolate sauce for extra flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze the Cake:</strong> Place the assembled cake in the freezer for at least 4 hours, or until the ice cream layer is firm. Before serving, let the cake sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes to make it easier to slice.</li>
</ol>
