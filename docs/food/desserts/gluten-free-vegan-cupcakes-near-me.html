    <h1>Gluten-Free Vegan Cupcakes Near Me: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

Combining these two dietary needs can be challenging, but it’s also an opportunity to explore creative and delicious baking techniques. These cupcakes are often made with alternative flours like almond, coconut, or rice flour, and use plant-based ingredients such as flaxseed, applesauce, or aquafaba as egg substitutes.</p>
