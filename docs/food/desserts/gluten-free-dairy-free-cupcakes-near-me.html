<h2>What Makes Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Cupcakes Special?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free dairy-free cupcakes are made without wheat, barley, rye, or any dairy products. Instead, they use alternative flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or rice flour, and dairy substitutes such as almond milk, coconut milk, or oat milk. These ingredients not only make the cupcakes safe for those with dietary restrictions but also add unique flavors and textures that can be surprisingly delightful.</p>

<p>For example, almond flour gives cupcakes a rich, nutty flavor and a moist texture, while coconut flour adds a subtle sweetness and a light, airy crumb. Dairy-free milk alternatives can also enhance the flavor profile, with coconut milk adding a tropical twist and oat milk providing a creamy, neutral base.</p>
