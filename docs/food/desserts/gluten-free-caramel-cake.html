    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Caramel Cake</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free cake can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to achieve a perfect result every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Cake Cool Completely:</strong> Frosting a warm cake can cause the frosting to melt and slide off. Be patient and let the cake cool completely before frosting.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Caramel:</strong> If you’re feeling adventurous, try making your own caramel sauce from scratch. It’s easier than you think and adds a homemade touch to your cake.</li>
    </ul>
