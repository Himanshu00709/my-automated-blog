    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free fried Oreos is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a batch of crispy, golden treats:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg and milk. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until you have a smooth batter. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter—thick enough to coat the Oreos but not too runny.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Heat the Oil</h3>
    <p>Pour the oil into a deep frying pan or pot and heat it to 375°F (190°C). Use a thermometer to ensure the oil reaches the correct temperature. If the oil is too hot, the Oreos will burn; if it’s not hot enough, they’ll absorb too much oil and become greasy.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Coat the Oreos</h3>
    <p>Dip each gluten-free Oreo into the batter, ensuring it’s fully coated. Use a fork or tongs to lift the Oreo out of the batter, allowing any excess to drip off. Carefully place the coated Oreo into the hot oil. Fry a few Oreos at a time, but don’t overcrowd the pan.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Fry to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Fry the Oreos for about 2-3 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the Oreos have cooled slightly, dust them with powdered sugar if desired. Serve them warm for the best experience. The combination of the crispy exterior and the soft, creamy center is simply irresistible.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fried Oreos</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use any gluten-free flour for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend, such as almond flour, rice flour, or a pre-made gluten-free baking mix. However, the texture may vary slightly depending on the flour you choose.</p>

        <h3>2. Are gluten-free Oreos really gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free Oreos are made without any gluten-containing ingredients and are certified gluten-free. However, always check the packaging to ensure they meet your dietary needs.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the egg with a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) and use plant-based milk. The result will still be delicious and crispy.</p>

        <h3>4. How should I store leftover fried Oreos?</h3>
        <p>Fried Oreos are best enjoyed fresh, but if you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. Reheat them in the oven to restore their crispiness.</p>

        <h3>5. Can I bake these instead of frying?</h3>
        <p>While frying gives the Oreos their signature crispy texture, you can bake them at 375°F (190°C) for about 10-12 minutes. However, the result will be less crispy and more cake-like.</p>
    </div>
