    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free blueberry donuts.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your donuts bake evenly and rise properly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Donut Pan</h3>
    <p>Grease your donut pan with a little coconut oil or use a non-stick spray. This will prevent the donuts from sticking to the pan.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure they are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, honey or maple syrup, vanilla extract, and melted coconut oil. Make sure the mixture is well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense donuts.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in the Blueberries</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the fresh or frozen blueberries into the batter. If you’re using frozen blueberries, make sure to coat them lightly in flour to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the donuts.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Fill the Donut Pan</h3>
    <p>Using a piping bag or a spoon, fill each cavity of the donut pan about two-thirds full with the batter. This allows room for the donuts to rise as they bake.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Bake the Donuts</h3>
    <p>Place the donut pan in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the donuts comes out clean. Be careful not to overbake, as this can dry out the donuts.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the donuts from the oven and let them cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Blueberry Donuts</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours like rice flour or coconut flour. However, keep in mind that different flours have different textures and absorption rates, so you may need to adjust the amount of liquid in the recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these donuts vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and use a non-dairy milk like almond or oat milk. Make sure to use a vegan sweetener like maple syrup instead of honey.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these donuts?</h3>
        <p>Store the donuts in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate them for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months. Just make sure to thaw them before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add a glaze to these donuts?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add a simple glaze made from powdered sugar and milk. For a healthier option, try a glaze made with coconut cream and a touch of honey.</p>
