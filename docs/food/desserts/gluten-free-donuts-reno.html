    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Donut?</h2>
    <p>Creating a gluten-free donut that rivals traditional donuts in taste and texture is no small feat. The key lies in the ingredients and the baking process. Many gluten-free donuts are made with alternative flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or rice flour. These flours provide a similar texture to wheat flour but without the gluten. Additionally, the use of xanthan gum or psyllium husk can help mimic the elasticity that gluten provides, resulting in a donut that is soft and chewy rather than crumbly.</p>

    <p>Another important factor is the frying or baking process. Some gluten-free donuts are baked, which can result in a denser texture, while others are fried, offering a lighter, fluffier donut. The best gluten-free donuts strike a balance between these two methods, offering a product that is both delicious and satisfying.</p>
