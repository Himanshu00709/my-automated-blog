    <h2>Tips for Baking Perfect Gluten-Free Nut-Free Cupcakes</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free nut-free cupcakes can be a bit challenging, but with the right tips, you can achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Measure Accurately:</strong> Gluten-free flours can be denser than traditional flours, so it’s crucial to measure your ingredients accurately to avoid dry or crumbly cupcakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Xanthan Gum:</strong> Xanthan gum is a common additive in gluten-free baking that helps mimic the elasticity and structure that gluten provides. Adding a small amount can improve the texture of your cupcakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to dense cupcakes. Mix just until the ingredients are combined to ensure a light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Cross-Contamination:</strong> If you’re baking for someone with severe allergies, make sure all your utensils, bowls, and baking pans are thoroughly cleaned to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
    </ul>
