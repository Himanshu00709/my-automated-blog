    <h1>Gluten-Free Cider Mill Donuts: A Delicious Fall Treat</h1>
    <p>As the leaves begin to change and the air turns crisp, there's nothing quite like the aroma of freshly baked cider mill donuts wafting through the air. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, the thought of indulging in these seasonal treats might seem like a distant dream. However, with the rise of gluten-free baking, cider mill donuts are now more accessible than ever. In this article, we'll explore the world of gluten-free cider mill donuts, from their history to how you can make them at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Cider Mill Donuts</h2>
    <p>Cider mill donuts have a rich history that dates back to the early days of American cider production. Traditionally, these donuts were made with fresh apple cider, which was a byproduct of the apple pressing process. The cider not only added a unique flavor but also helped to create a moist and tender texture. Over time, cider mill donuts became a staple at fall festivals, apple orchards, and farmers' markets, symbolizing the essence of autumn.</p>
    <p>However, as gluten-free diets gained popularity, many people found themselves unable to enjoy these seasonal treats. This led to the development of gluten-free versions of cider mill donuts, allowing everyone to partake in the fall tradition.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Gluten-Free Cider Mill Donuts Special?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free cider mill donuts are made without wheat flour, which is the primary source of gluten. Instead, they use alternative flours such as almond flour, rice flour, or a gluten-free flour blend. These flours not only make the donuts safe for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease but also add a unique flavor and texture.</p>
    <p>One of the key ingredients in gluten-free cider mill donuts is, of course, apple cider. The cider adds a subtle sweetness and a hint of tartness, making the donuts incredibly flavorful. Additionally, the cider helps to keep the donuts moist, which is especially important when working with gluten-free flours that can sometimes result in a drier texture.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Cider Mill Donuts at Home</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free cider mill donuts at home is easier than you might think. With a few simple ingredients and some basic kitchen tools, you can recreate the magic of a cider mill in your own kitchen. Here's a step-by-step guide to making your own gluten-free cider mill donuts:</p>
