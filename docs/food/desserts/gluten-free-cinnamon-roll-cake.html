    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free cinnamon roll cake is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a delicious dessert that everyone will love:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan with butter or non-stick spray, and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Cake Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Cinnamon Swirl</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar and ground cinnamon. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour half of the cake batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly. Sprinkle half of the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the batter. Add the remaining batter on top, and then sprinkle the rest of the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the top. Use a knife or skewer to swirl the cinnamon sugar into the batter, creating a marbled effect.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake and Cool</h3>
    <p>Bake the cake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cinnamon Roll Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours like almond flour or oat flour, but the texture may vary. A gluten-free flour blend with xanthan gum works best for this recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a non-dairy milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or raisins to the cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add chopped nuts or raisins to the cinnamon swirl for extra texture and flavor. Just be sure to mix them in with the cinnamon-sugar mixture before sprinkling it over the batter.</p>
