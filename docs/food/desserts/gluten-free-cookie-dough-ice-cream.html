    <h1>Gluten-Free Cookie Dough Ice Cream: A Delicious Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Ice cream is a universally loved dessert, and when you combine it with the irresistible flavor of cookie dough, it becomes a treat that’s hard to resist. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional cookie dough ice cream is off the menu. Enter gluten-free cookie dough ice cream—a delicious, safe, and equally indulgent alternative that everyone can enjoy. In this article, we’ll explore what makes gluten-free cookie dough ice cream so special, how it’s made, and why it’s a must-try for anyone looking to satisfy their sweet tooth without compromising their health.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Cookie Dough Ice Cream?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free cookie dough ice cream is a variation of the classic cookie dough ice cream, but with one key difference: the cookie dough is made without gluten-containing ingredients. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. By using gluten-free flours like almond flour, rice flour, or oat flour, manufacturers and home cooks can create a cookie dough that’s safe for everyone to enjoy.</p>
    <p>This ice cream typically features a creamy base, often made with dairy or non-dairy alternatives like coconut milk or almond milk, and is studded with chunks of gluten-free cookie dough. The result is a dessert that’s just as rich, creamy, and satisfying as its traditional counterpart, but without the gluten.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Cookie Dough Ice Cream?</h2>
    <p>There are several reasons why gluten-free cookie dough ice cream has become a popular choice among dessert lovers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues, fatigue, and other health problems. Gluten-free cookie dough ice cream allows them to enjoy a beloved treat without the risk of adverse reactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Gluten-free options make it possible for everyone to enjoy the same desserts, regardless of dietary restrictions. This is especially important at social gatherings where food is a central part of the experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavor and Texture:</strong> Gluten-free cookie dough can be just as delicious and satisfying as traditional cookie dough. With the right ingredients, it’s possible to achieve a similar taste and texture, making it hard to tell the difference.</li>
    </ul>
