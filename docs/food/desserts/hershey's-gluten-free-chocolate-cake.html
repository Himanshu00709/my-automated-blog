    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your Hershey's Gluten-Free Chocolate Cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans or one 9x13-inch rectangular pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add wet ingredients:</strong> Add the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix on medium speed until the batter is smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate boiling water:</strong> Carefully stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin, but this is normal and ensures a moist cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and frost:</strong> Allow the cake to cool completely before frosting with your favorite gluten-free frosting.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Chocolate Cake</h2>
    <p>Here are some expert tips to ensure your Hershey's Gluten-Free Chocolate Cake turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the cake cool completely:</strong> Frosting a warm cake can cause it to melt and slide off. Patience is key!</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with toppings:</strong> Try adding fresh berries, whipped cream, or a drizzle of chocolate ganache for an extra special touch.</li>
    </ul>
