<h1>Gluten-Free Drumsticks Ice Cream: A Delicious and Safe Treat</h1>

<p>Ice cream is a universally loved dessert, and Drumsticks have been a favorite for decades. With their iconic cone shape, creamy ice cream, and crunchy toppings, Drumsticks are a nostalgic treat for many. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying traditional Drumsticks can be a challenge.

<h2>What Are Gluten-Free Drumsticks?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free Drumsticks are a variation of the classic ice cream cone, specifically designed for individuals who need to avoid gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Traditional Drumsticks contain gluten in their cone and sometimes in the toppings, but gluten-free versions use alternative ingredients to ensure they are safe for everyone to enjoy.</p>

<p>These gluten-free Drumsticks maintain the same delicious taste and texture as the original, with a crispy cone, smooth ice cream, and a satisfying chocolate coating. They are perfect for anyone looking to indulge in a classic treat without worrying about gluten.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Gluten-Free Drumsticks</h2>

<p>One of the key aspects of gluten-free Drumsticks is their ingredient list. Here’s a breakdown of what you’ll typically find in a gluten-free Drumstick:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Ingredient</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Gluten-Free Cone</td>
            <td>Made from rice flour, tapioca starch, or other gluten-free flours, the cone provides the same crunch as a traditional cone without the gluten.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Ice Cream</td>
            <td>Typically made from milk, cream, sugar, and natural flavors, the ice cream is naturally gluten-free.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Chocolate Coating</td>
            <td>A rich chocolate shell made from cocoa, sugar, and gluten-free stabilizers.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Toppings</td>

        </tr>
