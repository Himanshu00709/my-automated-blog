    <h1>Gluten-Free Knafeh: A Delicious Twist on a Middle Eastern Classic</h1>
    <p>Knafeh, a beloved Middle Eastern dessert, is known for its rich, cheesy filling and crispy, golden crust. Traditionally made with semolina or shredded phyllo dough, this dessert is a staple at celebrations and family gatherings. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this treat can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free knafeh—a delightful adaptation that allows everyone to savor this iconic dessert without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>What is Knafeh?</h2>
    <p>Knafeh, also spelled kunafa or kanafeh, is a traditional Middle Eastern dessert that dates back centuries. It typically consists of a layer of sweet, gooey cheese or cream, sandwiched between layers of shredded phyllo dough or semolina. The dessert is baked until golden and crispy, then soaked in a fragrant sugar syrup flavored with rose water or orange blossom water. The result is a harmonious blend of textures and flavors—crunchy, creamy, sweet, and aromatic.</p>

    <h2>The Rise of Gluten-Free Knafeh</h2>
    <p>With the increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders and the growing demand for gluten-free options, chefs and home cooks alike have begun experimenting with alternative ingredients to create gluten-free versions of traditional dishes. Gluten-free knafeh is one such innovation, offering a safe and delicious option for those who need to avoid gluten. By substituting traditional wheat-based ingredients with gluten-free alternatives, this dessert retains its signature taste and texture while catering to dietary restrictions.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Knafeh</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free knafeh at home is easier than you might think. The key is to use gluten-free flour blends or alternative grains that mimic the texture of traditional knafeh crust. Below is a step-by-step guide to creating your own gluten-free knafeh:</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Syrup:</strong> In a small saucepan, combine sugar, water, and rose water or orange blossom water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes until the syrup thickens slightly. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Crust:</strong> In a large bowl, mix the gluten-free flour blend with melted butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press half of this mixture into the bottom of a greased baking dish to form the base.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In another bowl, combine the shredded mozzarella and ricotta cheese. Spread this mixture evenly over the crust in the baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Top the Knafeh:</strong> Sprinkle the remaining flour-butter mixture over the cheese layer, pressing gently to form the top crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the knafeh for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish with Syrup:</strong> Once the knafeh is out of the oven, immediately pour the cooled syrup over the top, allowing it to soak into the layers. Garnish with crushed pistachios before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Knafeh</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Opt for a gluten-free flour blend that is designed for baking. Some blends contain xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Butter:</strong> Butter is essential for achieving the crispy, golden crust that knafeh is known for. Make sure to use enough to coat the flour mixture thoroughly.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Cheeses:</strong> While mozzarella and ricotta are traditional, you can experiment with other cheeses like akkawi or nabulsi for an authentic Middle Eastern flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Warm:</strong> Knafeh is best enjoyed warm, straight from the oven. The contrast between the crispy crust and the gooey cheese filling is simply irresistible.</li>
    </ul>
