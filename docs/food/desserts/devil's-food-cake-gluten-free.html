    <h1>Gluten-Free Devil's Food Cake: A Decadent Delight</h1>
    <p>Devil's Food Cake is a classic dessert known for its rich, moist, and intensely chocolatey flavor. Traditionally, this cake is made with wheat flour, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this treat can be a challenge.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Devil's Food Cake</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free Devil's Food Cake:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour your cake pans, or line them with parchment paper to ensure easy removal of the cakes after baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined to avoid lumps in the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy. Gradually add the melted butter or oil, followed by the buttermilk or milk. Mix until the wet ingredients are fully incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cake. If desired, fold in any additional ingredients like chocolate chips or nuts.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Frost and Decorate</h3>
    <p>Once the cakes are completely cool, frost them with your favorite gluten-free frosting. A classic choice is a rich chocolate ganache or a creamy buttercream frosting. Decorate with fresh berries, chocolate shavings, or sprinkles for an extra touch of elegance.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Devil's Food Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use any gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, but it's important to choose a blend that is specifically designed for baking. Some blends may contain ingredients that affect the texture or flavor of the cake. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and use a non-dairy milk such as almond milk or oat milk. Just ensure that all your ingredients are gluten-free and dairy-free.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I store gluten-free Devil's Food Cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. If you need to store it longer, you can freeze the cake (without frosting) for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator before serving.</p>
    </div>
