    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut flour, and cold butter (or coconut oil). Use a pastry cutter or your hands to mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the egg and mix until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the apple filling. In a large bowl, toss the sliced apples with monk fruit sweetener, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Ensure that the apples are evenly coated with the mixture. Set aside to allow the flavors to meld.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Roll out the chilled dough between two sheets of parchment paper to fit your pie dish. Carefully transfer the dough to the dish, pressing it gently into the bottom and sides. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges. Pour the apple filling into the crust, spreading it evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Pie</h3>
    <p>Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the apples are tender. Allow the pie to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. This will help the filling set and make it easier to slice.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten and Sugar-Free Apple Pie</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different type of flour for the crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours such as oat flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>2. What can I use instead of monk fruit sweetener?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have monk fruit sweetener, you can use other natural sweeteners like stevia, erythritol, or even a small amount of honey or maple syrup. Adjust the quantity to taste.</p>

        <h3>3. How do I store the pie?</h3>
        <p>Store the pie in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the pie for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply place it in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until warmed through.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I add other fruits to the filling?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Feel free to add other fruits like pears, berries, or even a handful of raisins to the filling. Just be mindful of the sweetness and adjust the sweetener accordingly.</p>
