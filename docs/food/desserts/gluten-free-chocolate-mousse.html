<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free chocolate mousse:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Melt the Chocolate</h3>
<p>Begin by melting the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water. Stir occasionally until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Egg Yolks</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks with half of the sugar until the mixture becomes pale and slightly thickened. Gradually add the melted chocolate to the egg yolk mixture, stirring constantly to combine.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Whip the Egg Whites</h3>
<p>In another clean bowl, beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks. Gradually add the remaining sugar and continue beating until the egg whites are stiff and glossy.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Fold in the Whipped Cream</h3>
<p>Gently fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture until well combined. Then, carefully fold in the whipped egg whites, being careful not to deflate the mixture.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Chill and Serve</h3>
<p>Divide the mousse into serving dishes and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until set. Serve chilled, garnished with fresh berries or a dollop of whipped cream if desired.</p>
