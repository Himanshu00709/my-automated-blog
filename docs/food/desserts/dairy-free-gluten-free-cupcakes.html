    <h2>How to Make Dairy-Free Gluten-Free Cupcakes</h2>
    <p>Making dairy-free gluten-free cupcakes is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create these delicious treats at home:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Before you begin, ensure you have all the necessary ingredients. This includes gluten-free flour, dairy-free milk, an egg replacer, dairy-free butter, and your choice of sweetener. Don’t forget the flavorings, such as vanilla extract or cocoa powder, depending on the type of cupcake you’re making.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>Start by mixing the dry ingredients in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the wet ingredients. Gradually add the wet mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense cupcakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Cupcakes</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with cupcake liners. Fill each liner about two-thirds full with the batter. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cupcakes to cool completely before frosting.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Frost and Decorate</h3>
    <p>Once the cupcakes are cool, it’s time to frost them. Use a dairy-free frosting, such as one made with coconut cream or vegan butter. You can also add toppings like fresh fruit, dairy-free chocolate chips, or sprinkles for extra flair.</p>
