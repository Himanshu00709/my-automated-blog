    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's walk through the process of making this delightful cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Ensure there are no lumps in the almond flour for a smooth batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until frothy. Add the honey (or maple syrup) and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until a smooth batter forms. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Raspberries:</strong> Gently fold in the fresh raspberries, being careful not to crush them. This will ensure that the raspberries remain whole and provide bursts of flavor in every bite.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Cake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra touch of indulgence.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Raspberry Almond Cake</h2>
    <p>To ensure your cake turns out perfectly every time, here are some expert tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Raspberries:</strong> Fresh raspberries are ideal for this recipe as they provide the best flavor and texture. However, if fresh raspberries are not available, you can use frozen ones—just make sure to thaw and drain them well before adding to the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix the ingredients just until they are combined to maintain a light and airy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking the cake at the 30-minute mark. The cake is done when the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> This cake can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months—just wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Raspberry Almond Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use other berries instead of raspberries?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While raspberries are the star of this recipe, you can easily substitute them with other berries like blueberries, blackberries, or strawberries. Each berry will bring its own unique flavor and texture to the cake.</p>

        <h3>Is almond flour the same as almond meal?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour and almond meal are similar but not identical. Almond flour is made from blanched almonds (without the skins) and has a finer texture, while almond meal is made from almonds with the skins on and has a coarser texture. For this recipe, almond flour is recommended for a smoother cake texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a vegan version of this cake by substituting the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and using a plant-based sweetener like agave syrup instead of honey.</p>

        <h3>How can I make the cake more decadent?</h3>
        <p>For an extra indulgent treat, you can drizzle the cake with a simple glaze made from powdered sugar and lemon juice, or serve it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>
    </div>

With its moist, nutty base and bursts of tangy raspberries, this cake is a crowd-pleaser that will leave everyone asking for seconds.
