    <h1>Does Baklava Have Gluten? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Baklava is a rich, sweet pastry that has been enjoyed for centuries across the Middle East, Mediterranean, and Balkans. Known for its layers of phyllo dough, nuts, and honey syrup, baklava is a favorite dessert for many. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question arises: <strong>Does baklava have gluten?</strong> In this article, we will explore the ingredients of traditional baklava, discuss gluten-free alternatives, and provide answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What is Baklava?</h2>

    <p>Baklava is a dessert made from layers of phyllo dough, which are brushed with butter or oil, and filled with chopped nuts such as pistachios, walnuts, or almonds. The pastry is then baked and soaked in a sweet syrup made from honey, sugar, and lemon juice. The result is a decadent, flaky, and nutty treat that is often served during special occasions and celebrations.</p>

    <h2>Does Traditional Baklava Contain Gluten?</h2>

    <p>Traditional baklava is made with phyllo dough, which is typically made from wheat flour. Wheat flour contains gluten, a protein that can cause adverse reactions in individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Therefore, <strong>traditional baklava does contain gluten</strong>.</p>

    <p>Here is a breakdown of the main ingredients in traditional baklava and their gluten content:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten Content</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Phyllo Dough</td>
                <td>Contains Gluten</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Butter or Oil</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Nuts (Pistachios, Walnuts, Almonds)</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Honey Syrup</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Baklava: Is It Possible?</h2>

    <p>Yes, it is possible to make gluten-free baklava by substituting the traditional phyllo dough with gluten-free alternatives. Gluten-free phyllo dough can be made using a combination of gluten-free flours such as rice flour, tapioca flour, and xanthan gum. These flours mimic the texture and elasticity of wheat flour, allowing you to create layers similar to traditional phyllo dough.</p>

    <p>Here are some tips for making gluten-free baklava:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Gluten-Free Phyllo Dough:</strong> Look for pre-made gluten-free phyllo dough in specialty stores or online. Alternatively, you can make your own using gluten-free flours.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Other Ingredients:</strong> Ensure that all other ingredients, such as nuts and honey syrup, are certified gluten-free to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Prevent Cross-Contamination:</strong> Use clean utensils and baking pans to prevent any contact with gluten-containing ingredients.</li>
    </ul>
