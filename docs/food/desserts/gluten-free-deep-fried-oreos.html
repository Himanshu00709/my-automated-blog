    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free deep-fried Oreos:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>

    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg and milk. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until you have a smooth batter. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter—thick enough to coat the Oreos but not too runny.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Heat the Oil</h3>

    <p>Pour the vegetable oil into a deep frying pan or pot and heat it to 375°F (190°C). Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature, as maintaining the right heat is crucial for achieving a crispy exterior without burning the cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Coat the Oreos</h3>

    <p>Dip each gluten-free Oreo into the batter, ensuring it’s fully coated. Use a fork or tongs to gently place the coated Oreo into the hot oil. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan—fry 2-3 Oreos at a time to maintain the oil temperature.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Fry to Perfection</h3>

    <p>Fry the Oreos for about 2-3 minutes, or until they turn golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once the Oreos have cooled slightly, dust them with powdered sugar for an extra touch of sweetness. Serve them warm and enjoy the crispy, gooey goodness of gluten-free deep-fried Oreos!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Deep Fried Oreos</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free deep-fried Oreos is relatively straightforward, but here are a few tips to ensure your treats turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Thermometer:</strong> Maintaining the right oil temperature is key. If the oil is too hot, the Oreos will burn; if it’s too cool, they’ll absorb too much oil and become greasy.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense batter. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Try adding a dash of vanilla extract or cinnamon to the batter for an extra layer of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Immediately:</strong> Deep-fried Oreos are best enjoyed fresh and warm. If you need to make them ahead of time, reheat them in the oven for a few minutes before serving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Deep Fried Oreos</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular Oreos if I’m not gluten-sensitive?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular Oreos if you don’t have a gluten sensitivity. However, the recipe is specifically designed for those who need or prefer gluten-free options.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best oil for frying?</h3>
        <p>Vegetable oil is the most commonly used oil for frying due to its neutral flavor and high smoke point. However, you can also use canola oil or peanut oil.</p>

        <h3>Can I bake these instead of frying?</h3>
        <p>While baking is a healthier alternative, it won’t give you the same crispy texture as deep-frying. If you prefer to bake, try brushing the Oreos with a little oil and baking them at 375°F (190°C) for about 10-12 minutes.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover deep-fried Oreos?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. Reheat them in the oven to restore their crispiness.</p>
    </div>

With the right ingredients and a little practice, you can easily recreate this indulgent dessert at home.
