    <h2>What is a Chess Pie?</h2>
    <p>Chess pie is a traditional Southern dessert known for its simple yet irresistible filling made from sugar, butter, eggs, and a small amount of flour or cornmeal.

The filling is typically creamy, sweet, and slightly tangy, making it a versatile base for various flavor additions, including chocolate.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pie Crust</h3>
    <p>If you're using a store-bought gluten-free pie crust, follow the package instructions for pre-baking. If you're making your own, roll out the dough and press it into a 9-inch pie dish. Prick the bottom with a fork and bake at 375°F (190°C) for about 10 minutes, or until lightly golden. Set aside to cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Melt the Chocolate and Butter</h3>
    <p>In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the butter and chocolate chips. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each, until the mixture is smooth and fully melted. Alternatively, you can melt the mixture using a double boiler on the stovetop.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt until well combined. Slowly pour in the melted chocolate and butter mixture, stirring continuously. Finally, add the heavy cream and mix until the filling is smooth and glossy.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Pie</h3>
    <p>Pour the filling into the pre-baked pie crust. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 30-35 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle. Allow the pie to cool completely on a wire rack before serving.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free chocolate chess pie is delicious on its own, but you can elevate it with a dollop of whipped cream, a sprinkle of powdered sugar, or a scoop of vanilla ice cream. For a festive touch, garnish with fresh berries or a drizzle of chocolate sauce.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this pie ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the pie up to two days in advance. Store it in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, and bring it to room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of chocolate?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute semi-sweet chocolate with dark chocolate or milk chocolate, depending on your preference. Just keep in mind that the sweetness level may vary.</p>

        <h3>Is this pie suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe contains dairy and eggs, so it is not vegan. However, you can experiment with plant-based substitutes like coconut cream and flax eggs to create a vegan version.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover pie in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 3 days. You can also freeze the pie for up to 2 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before serving.</p>
