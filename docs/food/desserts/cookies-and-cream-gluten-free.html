    <h1>Cookies and Cream Gluten-Free: A Delicious Guide</h1>
    <p>For those who love the classic combination of cookies and cream but need to avoid gluten, the good news is that you don’t have to miss out on this delightful treat. Gluten-free cookies and cream products have become increasingly popular, offering a safe and delicious alternative for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about cookies and cream gluten-free options, from recipes to store-bought products, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Cookies and Cream Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Traditional cookies and cream flavors often rely on gluten-containing ingredients, such as wheat flour in the cookies. However, gluten-free versions use alternative flours like almond flour, rice flour, or oat flour to create the same crunchy, chocolatey goodness without the gluten. The cream component, typically made from dairy or non-dairy alternatives, remains naturally gluten-free, making it easier to adapt this beloved flavor combination for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Popular Gluten-Free Cookies and Cream Products</h2>
    <p>Many brands have recognized the demand for gluten-free options and have introduced cookies and cream products that cater to this need. Here are some popular choices:</p>
