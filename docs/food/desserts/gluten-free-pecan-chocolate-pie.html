<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>

<p>If you’re using a store-bought gluten-free pie crust, simply follow the instructions on the packaging to prepare it. If you’re making your own crust, combine gluten-free flour, cold butter, and a pinch of salt in a food processor until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Roll out the dough and press it into a pie dish, then chill it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Melt the Chocolate</h3>

<p>In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the dark chocolate chips in 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval until smooth. Alternatively, you can melt the chocolate using a double boiler. Once melted, spread the chocolate evenly over the bottom of the prepared pie crust.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Prepare the Filling</h3>

<p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the brown sugar, corn syrup, and salt, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Remove the mixture from the heat and let it cool slightly. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs and vanilla extract together. Gradually add the sugar mixture to the eggs, whisking constantly to prevent the eggs from curdling.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Assemble the Pie</h3>

<p>Arrange the pecans evenly over the melted chocolate in the pie crust. Pour the filling mixture over the pecans, ensuring that they are fully coated. Gently tap the pie dish on the counter to remove any air bubbles.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake the Pie</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Place the pie on the middle rack and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown. If the edges of the crust begin to brown too quickly, cover them with aluminum foil.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>

<p>Allow the pie to cool completely on a wire rack before serving. This will give the filling time to set and make it easier to slice. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra treat.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pecan Chocolate Pie</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of nut?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute pecans with other nuts like walnuts or almonds. However, keep in mind that the flavor and texture of the pie will be slightly different.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this pie ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! This pie can be made a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator. Just be sure to let it come to room temperature before serving.</p>

    <h3>Is corn syrup necessary?</h3>
    <p>Corn syrup helps to create the gooey texture that’s characteristic of pecan pie. If you prefer, you can use maple syrup or honey as a substitute, but the texture may vary.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze this pie?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the pie for up to 2 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>
