    <h2>How to Make Your Own Gluten-Free Ice Cream Cake</h2>

    <p>If you’re feeling adventurous, making your own gluten-free ice cream cake at home can be a fun and rewarding experience. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk (or dairy-free alternative)</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 quart gluten-free ice cream (your choice of flavor)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch round cake pan.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Once the cake has cooled, slice it horizontally to create two layers. Place one layer on a serving plate and spread a layer of softened ice cream over it. Top with the second cake layer and freeze for at least 2 hours, or until firm.</li>
        <li>Before serving, let the cake sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes to soften slightly. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
