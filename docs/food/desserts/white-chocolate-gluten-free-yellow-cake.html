    <h1>White Chocolate Gluten-Free Yellow Cake: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>When it comes to baking, creating a cake that is both gluten-free and irresistibly delicious can be a challenge. However, the White Chocolate Gluten-Free Yellow Cake is here to prove that gluten-free desserts can be just as indulgent and satisfying as their traditional counterparts.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create your White Chocolate Gluten-Free Yellow Cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper for easy removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Ensure that these ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in your batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving the perfect texture in your cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Add the vanilla extract and mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in White Chocolate:</strong> Gently fold the melted white chocolate into the batter until it is evenly distributed. The white chocolate will add a rich, creamy flavor to the cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Frost:</strong> Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, frost with your favorite gluten-free frosting and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Cake</h2>
    <p>Baking a gluten-free cake can be a bit different from baking a traditional cake. Here are some tips to ensure your White Chocolate Gluten-Free Yellow Cake turns out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right combination of flours and starches to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense, heavy cake. Mix the batter just until the ingredients are combined to ensure a light, fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can sometimes take longer to bake than traditional cakes. Use a toothpick to check for doneness, and if it comes out clean, your cake is ready.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Cake Cool Completely:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be more delicate than traditional cakes, so it's important to let them cool completely before frosting or slicing.</li>
    </ul>
