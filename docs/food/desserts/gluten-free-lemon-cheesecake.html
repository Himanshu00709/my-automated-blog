<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Crust</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (163°C). In a medium-sized bowl, combine the crushed gluten-free graham crackers with the melted butter. Mix until the crumbs are evenly coated. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, ensuring an even layer. Bake the crust for about 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

<h3>2. Making the Cheesecake Filling</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until it’s smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice, mixing until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Finally, mix in the vanilla extract and sour cream until the filling is smooth and uniform.</p>

<h3>3. Baking the Cheesecake</h3>

<p>Pour the cheesecake filling over the cooled crust, spreading it evenly. Place the springform pan in a larger baking dish and fill the dish with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the springform pan. This water bath helps prevent cracks in the cheesecake. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door slightly open for about an hour. Then, refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours, or overnight, to allow it to set completely.</p>

<h3>4. Adding the Topping</h3>

<p>For an extra burst of lemon flavor, consider adding a lemon glaze or a dollop of whipped cream on top of the cheesecake before serving. You can also garnish with fresh lemon slices or zest for a decorative touch.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Lemon Cheesecake</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use regular graham crackers instead of gluten-free ones?</h3>
    <p>No, regular graham crackers contain gluten, which makes them unsuitable for a gluten-free diet. Be sure to use certified gluten-free graham crackers to keep the recipe safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <h3>2. How do I prevent cracks in my cheesecake?</h3>
    <p>Using a water bath during baking helps regulate the temperature and prevents cracks. Additionally, avoid overmixing the batter and be sure to cool the cheesecake gradually in the oven before refrigerating.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make this cheesecake ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, gluten-free lemon cheesecake can be made a day or two in advance. Store it in the refrigerator, covered, until you’re ready to serve. This allows the flavors to meld and the texture to set perfectly.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I freeze gluten-free lemon cheesecake?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Wrap the cheesecake tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. It can be stored in the freezer for up to 2 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>
