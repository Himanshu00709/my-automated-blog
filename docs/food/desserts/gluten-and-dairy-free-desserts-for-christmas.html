    <h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Christmas Desserts: A Festive Guide</h1>
    <p>Christmas is a time for indulgence, but for those with dietary restrictions, it can be challenging to find desserts that are both delicious and safe to eat. Whether you're gluten-intolerant, lactose-intolerant, or simply looking to explore healthier dessert options, this guide will provide you with a variety of gluten and dairy-free dessert ideas that are perfect for the holiday season.

Dairy-free desserts, on the other hand, avoid milk, cheese, and other dairy products, making them suitable for those who are lactose intolerant or have a dairy allergy. By choosing gluten and dairy-free desserts, you can create a more inclusive and health-conscious holiday spread.</p>

    <p>Panna cotta is a creamy Italian dessert that can be made dairy-free by using coconut milk instead of cream.
