    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a donut pan with non-stick cooking spray or butter to ensure the donuts don’t stick.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the melted butter and granulated sugar until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Finally, stir in the buttermilk until the mixture is smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense donuts.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fill the Donut Pan</h3>
    <p>Using a piping bag or a spoon, fill each cavity of the donut pan about two-thirds full with the batter. This will allow the donuts to rise evenly without overflowing.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the donuts in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the donuts to cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Coat with Cinnamon Sugar</h3>
    <p>While the donuts are still warm, brush them with melted butter. In a small bowl, mix the granulated sugar and ground cinnamon. Dip each donut into the cinnamon sugar mixture, ensuring they are evenly coated.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cinnamon Sugar Donuts</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, such as almond flour or coconut flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary depending on the flour you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these donuts vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and use a plant-based milk instead of buttermilk. Additionally, replace the butter with a vegan alternative.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these donuts?</h3>
        <p>Store the donuts in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to a month. Simply thaw and reheat before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these donuts without a donut pan?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have a donut pan, you can use a muffin tin instead. The donuts will have a slightly different shape, but they will still taste delicious.</p>
