    <ul>
        <li><strong>Digestive Health:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, gluten-free cakes prevent uncomfortable symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich Ingredients:</strong> Many gluten-free flours, such as almond and coconut flour, are packed with nutrients like protein, fiber, and healthy fats.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be made with a variety of flavors and fillings, making them suitable for any occasion.</li>
        <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> They allow everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions, to enjoy a slice of cake without worry.</li>
