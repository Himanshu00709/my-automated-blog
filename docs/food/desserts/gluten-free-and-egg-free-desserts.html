    <h2>Tips for Baking Gluten-Free and Egg-Free Desserts</h2>

    <p>Baking without gluten and eggs can be challenging, but with the right techniques, you can achieve delicious results. Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a blend of gluten-free flours:</strong> Combining different gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, rice flour, and tapioca flour, can help mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense and tough baked goods. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add moisture:</strong> Gluten-free flours tend to absorb more moisture, so consider adding extra liquid or fat to your recipes.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with binders:</strong> Since eggs act as binders, using substitutes like xanthan gum or psyllium husk can help hold your baked goods together.</li>
    </ul>
