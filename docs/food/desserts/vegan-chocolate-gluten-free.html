    <h1>Vegan Chocolate Gluten-Free: A Delicious and Healthy Indulgence</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for vegan and gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and chocolate is no exception. Vegan chocolate that is also gluten-free offers a guilt-free indulgence for those with dietary restrictions or those simply looking to make healthier choices.

    <h2>What is Vegan Gluten-Free Chocolate?</h2>

        <li><strong>Plant-Based Milk:</strong> Instead of dairy, vegan chocolate uses plant-based milk alternatives such as almond milk, oat milk, or coconut milk.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweeteners:</strong> Natural sweeteners like cane sugar, coconut sugar, or maple syrup are often used to sweeten vegan chocolate.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Additives:</strong> Any additional ingredients, such as nuts, fruits, or flavorings, must be gluten-free to ensure the final product is safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</li>
