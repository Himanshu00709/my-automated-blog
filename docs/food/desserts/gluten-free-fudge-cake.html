    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Fudge Cake</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free fudge cake is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a delicious and moist cake that everyone will love:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease your cake pan with butter or oil and line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and a pinch of salt. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined to avoid lumps in the batter.</p>

    <h3>3. Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the melted butter or oil, milk, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>6. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can frost the cake with your favorite gluten-free frosting or enjoy it as is.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Fudge Cake</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free fudge cake turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense and heavy cake. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be a bit more delicate, so be sure to check for doneness with a toothpick or cake tester.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Cake Cool Completely:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be more fragile when warm, so allow them to cool completely before slicing or frosting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fudge Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>While almond flour can be used in gluten-free baking, it has a different texture and moisture content compared to a gluten-free flour blend. For a fudge cake, it's best to use a blend specifically designed for baking to achieve the desired texture.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I store gluten-free fudge cake?</h3>
        <p>Store your gluten-free fudge cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this cake dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make this cake dairy-free by substituting the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil and using a non-dairy milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>4. Why is my gluten-free cake dry?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cakes can sometimes turn out dry if too much flour is used or if the cake is overbaked. Be sure to measure your ingredients accurately and check the cake for doneness a few minutes before the recommended baking time.</p>
