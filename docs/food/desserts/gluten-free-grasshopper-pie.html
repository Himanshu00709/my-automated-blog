    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free Grasshopper Pie is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a dessert that will impress your guests:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by crushing the gluten-free chocolate cookies into fine crumbs. You can do this by placing them in a food processor or by placing them in a zip-top bag and crushing them with a rolling pin. Once you have your crumbs, mix them with the melted butter until well combined. Press the mixture into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie dish, making sure to create an even layer. Place the crust in the refrigerator to set while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, combine the marshmallows and 1/2 cup of heavy cream. Heat the mixture over low heat, stirring constantly, until the marshmallows are completely melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the crème de menthe, green food coloring (if using), and vanilla extract. Allow the mixture to cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>3. Whip the Cream</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whip the remaining 1 cup of heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the marshmallow mixture until fully incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, as this can deflate the whipped cream and result in a less fluffy filling.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Pour the filling into the prepared crust, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Cover the pie with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours, or until the filling is set.</p>

    <h3>5. Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the pie is fully set, you can garnish it with additional whipped cream, chocolate shavings, or mint leaves if desired. Slice and serve chilled for the best experience.</p>
