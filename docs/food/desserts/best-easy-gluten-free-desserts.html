    <h3>1. Are gluten-free desserts healthier?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free desserts can be healthier if they are made with nutrient-dense ingredients like almond flour, coconut flour, and oats. However, it’s important to note that gluten-free does not automatically mean healthier, as some gluten-free products can still be high in sugar and fat. Always check the ingredients and nutritional information.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I substitute regular flour with gluten-free flour in any recipe?</h3>
    <p>While you can substitute regular flour with gluten-free flour in many recipes, it’s important to note that gluten-free flours behave differently than wheat flour. You may need to adjust the amount of liquid or add a binding agent like xanthan gum to achieve the desired texture. It’s often best to follow a recipe specifically designed for gluten-free baking.</p>

    <h3>3. What are some common gluten-free flours?</h3>
    <p>Some common gluten-free flours include almond flour, coconut flour, rice flour, oat flour, and tapioca flour. Each flour has its own unique properties, so it’s important to choose the right one for your recipe. For example, almond flour is great for cakes and cookies, while coconut flour is more absorbent and works well in dense baked goods.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I make gluten-free desserts without eggs?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make gluten-free desserts without eggs by using egg substitutes like flax eggs, chia eggs, or commercial egg replacers.
