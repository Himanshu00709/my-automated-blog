    <h2>What Makes These Desserts Stand Out?</h2>
    <p>What sets Seattle's gluten-free desserts apart is the attention to detail and the use of high-quality ingredients. Many of these bakeries and cafes source their ingredients locally, ensuring freshness and supporting the community. Additionally, they often experiment with alternative flours like almond, coconut, and rice flour to create desserts that are not only gluten-free but also rich in flavor and texture.</p>

    <h2>DIY Gluten-Free Desserts: Tips for Home Bakers</h2>
    <p>If you're inspired to try your hand at gluten-free baking, here are some tips to get you started:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Experiment with gluten-free flours like almond, coconut, or oat flour to find the best texture for your desserts.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Binders:</strong> Gluten-free flours lack the elasticity of wheat flour, so adding binders like xanthan gum or psyllium husk can help improve the texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense and tough baked goods. Mix until just combined for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free baking opens up a world of possibilities. Try adding spices, citrus zest, or extracts to enhance the flavor of your desserts.</li>
    </ul>
