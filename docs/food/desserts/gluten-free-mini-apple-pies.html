    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free mini apple pies is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create your own delicious mini pies:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by making the gluten-free pie crust. In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and a pinch of salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the apple filling. In a medium bowl, combine the diced apples, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Mix well to ensure the apples are evenly coated with the spices and sugar.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Mini Pies</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Use a round cookie cutter or a glass to cut out circles of dough. Press each circle into a mini muffin tin to form the pie crusts. Fill each crust with the apple mixture, being careful not to overfill. Roll out the remaining dough and cut out smaller circles or shapes to use as the pie tops. Place the tops over the filled crusts and press the edges to seal. Brush the tops with a beaten egg for a golden finish.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Bake the mini pies in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the crusts are golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Allow the pies to cool slightly before removing them from the muffin tin. Serve warm, and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Mini Apple Pies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While apples are a classic choice, you can easily substitute them with other fruits like pears, peaches, or berries. Just adjust the sugar and spices accordingly to complement the fruit you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these pies ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough and filling ahead of time and store them separately in the refrigerator. When you’re ready to bake, simply assemble the pies and pop them in the oven. You can also freeze the baked pies for up to a month and reheat them when needed.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour to use?</h3>
        <p>There are many gluten-free flour blends available, but for the best results, look for one that’s specifically designed for baking. Some popular options include Bob’s Red Mill Gluten-Free 1-to-1 Baking Flour and King Arthur Gluten-Free Measure for Measure Flour.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these pies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these pies vegan by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using a flax egg or another egg substitute for the egg wash. Just be sure to check that all your ingredients are vegan-friendly.</p>
