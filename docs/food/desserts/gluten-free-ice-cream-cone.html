<h1>Gluten-Free Ice Cream Cones: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Ice cream is a beloved treat enjoyed by people of all ages. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding a safe and delicious gluten-free ice cream cone can be a challenge. In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free ice cream cones, from their ingredients to where you can find them, and even how to make your own at home.</p>

<h2>What Are Gluten-Free Ice Cream Cones?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free ice cream cones are cones made without any gluten-containing ingredients. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Traditional ice cream cones are typically made from wheat flour, which contains gluten. Gluten-free cones, on the other hand, are made using alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or coconut flour.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Ice Cream Cones?</h2>

<p>Choosing gluten-free ice cream cones is essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. Additionally, many people without gluten intolerance choose gluten-free options for their potential health benefits, such as improved digestion and reduced inflammation.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Gluten-Free Ice Cream Cones</h2>
