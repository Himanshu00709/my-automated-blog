    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Gooey Butter Cake</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free gooey butter cake is surprisingly simple, and the process is quite similar to the traditional recipe. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan with butter or non-stick spray. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, 1 cup of granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the softened butter and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press this mixture evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan to form the crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Gooey Filling</h3>

    <p>In another bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the remaining 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract, and continue to beat until the mixture is well combined and creamy. Pour this filling over the crust, spreading it evenly with a spatula.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Cake</h3>

    <p>Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the center is set but still slightly jiggly. Be careful not to overbake, as the gooey texture is what makes this cake so special.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cool and Serve</h3>

    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for at least 30 minutes before dusting it with powdered sugar. Cut into squares and serve at room temperature. For an extra treat, serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Gooey Butter Cake</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free gooey butter cake turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten. Popular options include Bob's Red Mill 1-to-1 Baking Flour or King Arthur Measure for Measure Flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Make sure your butter, cream cheese, and eggs are at room temperature before you start. This ensures a smooth batter and even baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overbake:</strong> The center of the cake should still be slightly jiggly when you take it out of the oven. It will continue to set as it cools, so resist the urge to bake it until it's completely firm.</li>
        <li><strong>Let It Cool:</strong> Allow the cake to cool completely before cutting into it. This helps the gooey filling set and makes it easier to slice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Gooey Butter Cake</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>While almond flour can be used in gluten-free baking, it has a different texture and moisture content than traditional flour blends. For the best results, stick to a gluten-free flour blend that includes xanthan gum.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a dairy-free version by substituting the butter and cream cheese with plant-based alternatives. Look for dairy-free butter and cream cheese at your local grocery store.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftover cake?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add toppings to my gluten-free gooey butter cake?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Feel free to get creative with toppings like fresh berries, chocolate chips, or a drizzle of caramel sauce. Just make sure any additional ingredients are gluten-free.</p>
