    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making a Gluten-Free Cookie Cake</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free cookie cake:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cake bakes evenly and rises properly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare Your Baking Pan</h3>
    <p>Grease a round or rectangular baking pan with butter or a non-stick cooking spray. You can also line the pan with parchment paper for easy removal of the cake after baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine your gluten-free flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure they are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving the right texture in your cookie cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Make sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Fold in Additional Ingredients</h3>
    <p>If you’re adding chocolate chips, nuts, or other mix-ins, gently fold them into the batter at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into your prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can decorate the cake with frosting, sprinkles, or fresh fruit before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cookie Cakes</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>No, using regular flour will introduce gluten into the cake, making it unsuitable for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Always use certified gluten-free flour for the best results.</p>

        <h3>How do I store a gluten-free cookie cake?</h3>
        <p>Store your gluten-free cookie cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make a vegan gluten-free cookie cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a vegan gluten-free cookie cake by substituting the butter with coconut oil and using flax eggs or chia eggs instead of regular eggs. Ensure all other ingredients are vegan-friendly as well.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of sugar in a gluten-free cookie cake?</h3>
        <p>You can use natural sweeteners like coconut sugar, maple syrup, or honey as alternatives to refined sugar. Keep in mind that these substitutions may slightly alter the texture and flavor of the cake.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>A gluten-free cookie cake is a delightful dessert that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions. By using the right ingredients and following the steps outlined above, you can create a cake that is both delicious and safe for those avoiding gluten. Whether you’re celebrating a special occasion or simply craving a sweet treat, a gluten-free cookie cake is sure to satisfy your dessert cravings.
