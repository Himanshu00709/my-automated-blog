    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free French Silk Pie</h2>
    <p>Now that we’ve covered the key ingredients, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free French Silk Pie. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure a perfect result.</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Pie Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by making the gluten-free pie crust. Combine 1 ½ cups of gluten-free flour (such as almond or rice flour), ½ teaspoon of salt, and 1 tablespoon of sugar in a mixing bowl. Cut in ½ cup of cold, unsalted butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add 3-4 tablespoons of ice water, mixing until the dough comes together. Roll out the dough and press it into a 9-inch pie dish. Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown. Let it cool completely before adding the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Chocolate Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat 1 cup of softened unsalted butter and 1 ½ cups of sugar until light and fluffy. Melt 4 ounces of gluten-free dark chocolate and let it cool slightly. Gradually add the melted chocolate to the butter mixture, beating until well combined. Add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and 4 large eggs, one at a time, beating for 5 minutes after each addition. The mixture should become light and airy. Pour the filling into the cooled pie crust and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until set.</p>

    <h3>3. Top with Whipped Cream</h3>
    <p>Before serving, prepare the whipped cream topping. In a chilled mixing bowl, beat 1 cup of heavy cream and 2 tablespoons of sugar until stiff peaks form. Spread the whipped cream over the chilled pie, and garnish with chocolate shavings or curls if desired. Slice and serve immediately.</p>
