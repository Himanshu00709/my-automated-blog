<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making this gluten-free chocolate peppermint cake:</p>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

<h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in your batter.</p>

<h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving a tender crumb in your cake.</p>

<h3>4. Add Eggs and Extracts</h3>
<p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Then, mix in the vanilla and peppermint extracts. The peppermint extract will give your cake that refreshing holiday flavor.</p>

<h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. This method helps to create a smooth and evenly mixed batter.</p>

<h3>6. Add Hot Water</h3>
<p>Finally, stir in the hot water. The hot water helps to bloom the cocoa powder, enhancing the chocolate flavor and ensuring a moist cake.</p>

<h3>7. Bake the Cake</h3>
<p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

<h3>8. Frost and Decorate</h3>
<p>Once the cakes are completely cool, frost them with your favorite gluten-free chocolate frosting. Sprinkle the top with crushed peppermint candies for a festive touch. You can also add a drizzle of melted chocolate or a dusting of powdered sugar for extra flair.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>

<p>To ensure your gluten-free chocolate peppermint cake turns out perfectly, keep these tips in mind:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that is specifically designed for baking to achieve the best texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Measure Ingredients Accurately:</strong> Baking is a science, and precise measurements are key to success. Use a kitchen scale if possible.</li>
    <li><strong>Allow the Cake to Cool Completely:</strong> Frosting a warm cake can lead to a melted mess. Patience is key!</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can easily make this cake dairy-free by substituting the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and using a non-dairy milk in place of buttermilk.</p>

    <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
    <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. If you need to store it longer, refrigerate it for up to a week. Bring it to room temperature before serving for the best flavor and texture.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze the cake?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the cake. Wrap the unfrosted cake layers tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, then freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before frosting and serving.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of peppermint extract?</h3>
    <p>If you don't have peppermint extract, you can use mint extract or even a few drops of peppermint essential oil (food-grade). Adjust the amount to taste, as these alternatives can be more potent.</p>
