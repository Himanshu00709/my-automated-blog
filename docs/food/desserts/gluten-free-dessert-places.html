    <h1>Gluten-Free Dessert Places: A Sweet Escape for Everyone</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, and the dessert industry is no exception. Whether you have celiac disease, a gluten intolerance, or simply prefer to avoid gluten, finding delicious and safe dessert options can be a challenge. Fortunately, a growing number of bakeries, cafes, and restaurants are stepping up to the plate, offering a variety of gluten-free desserts that are just as indulgent as their traditional counterparts.
