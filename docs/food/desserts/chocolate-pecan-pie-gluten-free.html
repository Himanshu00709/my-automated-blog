    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making this delectable dessert.</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). If you’re using a store-bought gluten-free pie crust, ensure it’s thawed if frozen. If you’re making your own crust, roll it out and place it in a 9-inch pie dish, crimping the edges as desired.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Toast the Pecans</h3>
    <p>Spread the pecans evenly on a baking sheet and toast them in the preheated oven for about 5-7 minutes. This step enhances their flavor and adds a delightful crunch to your pie.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Melt the Chocolate</h3>
    <p>In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the dark chocolate chips in 30-second intervals, stirring in between until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly.</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the melted butter, brown sugar, beaten eggs, corn syrup, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix until well combined. Gradually fold in the melted chocolate, ensuring it’s evenly distributed throughout the mixture.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Spread the toasted pecans evenly over the bottom of the pie crust. Pour the chocolate filling over the pecans, ensuring they’re fully coated. Use a spatula to smooth the top.</p>
    <h3>Step 6: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown. If the edges of the crust begin to brown too quickly, cover them with aluminum foil.</p>
    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the pie to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra indulgent treat.</p>
