    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (163°C). In a medium bowl, combine the crushed gluten-free graham crackers with the melted butter. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Cheesecake Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until it's smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar, mixing until well combined. Next, add the sour cream and vanilla extract, blending until the mixture is smooth. Melt the Godiva chocolate in a double boiler or microwave, then fold it into the cream cheese mixture. Finally, add the eggs one at a time, mixing just until incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cheesecake.</p>

    <h3>3. Bake the Cheesecake</h3>
    <p>Pour the filling over the cooled crust and smooth the top with a spatula. Place the springform pan in a larger baking dish and fill the dish with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the springform pan. This water bath will help prevent cracks in your cheesecake. Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle.</p>

    <h3>4. Cool and Chill</h3>
    <p>Once baked, turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door slightly open for about an hour. Then, remove it from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature. Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow it to set fully.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of chocolate?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute Godiva chocolate with another high-quality chocolate of your choice. However, Godiva chocolate is recommended for its rich and luxurious flavor.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I store the cheesecake?</h3>
