    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, whole milk, and half of the sugar. Heat over medium heat until the mixture is warm but not boiling.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and the remaining sugar until the mixture is pale and thick.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the warm cream mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.</li>
        <li>Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon (about 5-7 minutes).</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in the pumpkin puree, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and salt. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to ensure a smooth texture.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate the mixture for at least 4 hours or overnight until it is completely chilled.</li>
        <li>Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        <li>Transfer the ice cream to a freezer-safe container and freeze for at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
