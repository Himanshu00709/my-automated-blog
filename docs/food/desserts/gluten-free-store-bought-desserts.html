<ul>
    <li><strong>Pair with Fresh Fruit:</strong> Enhance the flavor and nutritional value of your dessert by pairing it with fresh fruit, such as berries, sliced bananas, or a drizzle of honey.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> Add a dollop of whipped cream, a sprinkle of nuts, or a dusting of cocoa powder to elevate your dessert.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve Warm:</strong> Some gluten-free desserts, like brownies or cookies, taste even better when served warm. Pop them in the microwave for a few seconds to enhance their flavor and texture.</li>
