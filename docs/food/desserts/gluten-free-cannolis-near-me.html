    <h1>Gluten-Free Cannolis Near Me: A Delicious Guide</h1>
    <p>If you're a fan of Italian desserts but need to avoid gluten, you're in luck! Gluten-free cannolis are becoming increasingly popular, and many bakeries and restaurants are now offering this delightful treat. In this guide, we'll explore everything you need to know about finding the best gluten-free cannolis near you, from what to look for in a cannoli to where you can find them. Whether you're a long-time cannoli lover or new to this classic dessert, this guide will help you satisfy your sweet tooth without compromising your dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Cannoli Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Traditional cannolis are made with a wheat-based shell, which contains gluten. However, gluten-free cannolis use alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or a gluten-free flour blend to create the shell. The filling, typically made from ricotta cheese, sugar, and sometimes chocolate chips or candied fruit, is naturally gluten-free. The key to a great gluten-free cannoli is ensuring that the shell is crispy and flavorful, just like the traditional version.</p>
