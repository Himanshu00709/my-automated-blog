    <h1>Gluten-Free Ice Cream Treats: A Delicious Guide</h1>
    <p>Ice cream is a beloved treat enjoyed by people of all ages. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding safe and delicious gluten-free ice cream options can be a challenge. Fortunately, the market for gluten-free ice cream treats has expanded significantly in recent years, offering a wide variety of options that cater to dietary restrictions without compromising on taste.

    <h2>What Makes Ice Cream Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For ice cream to be considered gluten-free, it must not contain any ingredients derived from these grains. This includes avoiding additives, flavorings, and mix-ins that may contain gluten. Many ice cream brands now clearly label their products as gluten-free, making it easier for consumers to identify safe options. However, it’s always important to read ingredient labels carefully, as cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing.</p>
