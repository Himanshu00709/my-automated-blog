    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Baking?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has gained popularity in recent years, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also among health-conscious individuals looking to reduce their gluten intake.

By opting for gluten-free alternatives, you can enjoy your favorite baked goods without the discomfort or health risks associated with gluten.</p>
    <p>Moreover, gluten-free baking often incorporates nutrient-rich ingredients like almond flour, coconut flour, and oats, which can add extra fiber, protein, and healthy fats to your diet. These ingredients also contribute to a unique texture and flavor profile that can make your desserts even more enjoyable.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Apples</h3>
    <p>Start by peeling, coring, and slicing the apples. Toss them with a teaspoon of cinnamon and set aside. This will allow the apples to absorb the cinnamon flavor, enhancing the overall taste of the cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Cake Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Crumble Topping</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, rolled oats, and a teaspoon of cinnamon. Cut in the softened butter using a fork or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. This crumble topping will add a delightful crunch to your cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch springform pan. Spread the cake batter evenly into the pan. Arrange the sliced apples on top of the batter, then sprinkle the crumble topping over the apples. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Apple Crumble Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as coconut flour or rice flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly depending on the flour you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter, to make the cake dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts to the crumble topping?</h3>
        <p>Yes, adding chopped nuts like walnuts or pecans to the crumble topping can add an extra layer of texture and flavor. Just be sure to check for any nut allergies before serving.</p>
