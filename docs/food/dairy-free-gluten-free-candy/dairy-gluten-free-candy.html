    <h1>Dairy-Free and Gluten-Free Candy: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with dietary restrictions, finding delicious and safe treats can be a challenge. Whether you're lactose intolerant, have celiac disease, or simply prefer to avoid dairy and gluten, the world of candy can seem limited. However, the good news is that there are plenty of dairy-free and gluten-free candy options available today. In this article, we’ll explore the best options, what to look for, and how to enjoy sweet treats without compromising your dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Dairy-Free and Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

    <p>Before diving into the world of dairy-free and gluten-free candy, it’s important to understand what these terms mean. Dairy-free refers to products that do not contain any milk or milk-derived ingredients. This is crucial for those who are lactose intolerant or have a milk allergy. Gluten-free, on the other hand, means the product does not contain gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. This is essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <p>When it comes to candy, many traditional options contain hidden dairy or gluten. For example, chocolate bars often contain milk, and some gummy candies may use wheat-based ingredients. Therefore, it’s important to read labels carefully and look for certified dairy-free and gluten-free products.</p>

    <h2>Popular Dairy-Free and Gluten-Free Candy Brands</h2>

    <p>Fortunately, many candy brands have recognized the need for dairy-free and gluten-free options. Here are some popular brands that offer delicious treats:</p>
