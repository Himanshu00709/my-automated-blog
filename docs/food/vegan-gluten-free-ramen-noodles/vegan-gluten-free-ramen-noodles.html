    <h2>How to Make Vegan Gluten-Free Ramen at Home</h2>

    <p>Making vegan gluten-free ramen at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to crafting your own bowl of comfort:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Broth</h3>
    <p>Start by heating your vegetable broth in a large pot. Add aromatics like garlic, ginger, and scallions to infuse the broth with flavor. For an umami-rich base, consider adding miso paste or a piece of kombu seaweed. Simmer the broth for at least 20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Noodles</h3>
    <p>While the broth simmers, cook your gluten-free noodles according to the package instructions. Be sure not to overcook them, as they can become mushy. Once cooked, rinse the noodles under cold water to stop the cooking process and set them aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Toppings</h3>
    <p>While the noodles and broth are cooking, prepare your toppings. Sauté tofu or tempeh in a pan with a bit of sesame oil until golden brown. Blanch or steam your vegetables to retain their crunch and vibrant color. Slice any additional garnishes like scallions, nori, or chili peppers.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble Your Ramen</h3>
    <p>To assemble your ramen, place a portion of cooked noodles in a bowl. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles, then arrange your toppings on top. Finish with a drizzle of sesame oil, a sprinkle of chili flakes, or a splash of gluten-free soy sauce for added flavor.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Vegan Gluten-Free Ramen</h2>

    <p>Vegan gluten-free ramen isn’t just delicious—it’s also packed with health benefits. Here are a few reasons why this dish is a great addition to your diet:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rich in Nutrients:</strong> The variety of vegetables and plant-based proteins used in vegan gluten-free ramen provides a wide range of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.</li>
