<h1>Gluten-Free Mayonnaise Brands: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Mayonnaise is a staple in many kitchens, used in everything from sandwiches to salads. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free mayonnaise can be a challenge. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe health issues for those with gluten-related disorders. Fortunately, many brands now offer gluten-free mayonnaise options. In this article, we’ll explore some of the best gluten-free mayonnaise brands available, their ingredients, and what makes them stand out.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Mayonnaise?</h2>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. While mayonnaise is typically made from oil, egg yolks, and vinegar—ingredients that are naturally gluten-free—some brands may include additives or flavorings that contain gluten. Therefore, it’s crucial to choose a mayonnaise that is explicitly labeled as gluten-free to ensure it’s safe for consumption.</p>
