<h1>Gluten-Free Pizza Sauce: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>When it comes to gluten-free diets, every ingredient matters. For pizza lovers, the sauce is just as important as the crust. Gluten-free pizza sauce is not only a necessity for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also a delicious option for anyone looking to explore healthier alternatives. In this article, we’ll dive deep into what makes a pizza sauce gluten-free, how to make your own, and some tips for selecting the best store-bought options.</p>

<h2>What Makes Pizza Sauce Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. While pizza sauce is typically made from tomatoes, herbs, and spices, some commercial sauces may contain hidden gluten in the form of additives or thickeners. To ensure your pizza sauce is gluten-free, it’s essential to check the ingredient list for any gluten-containing components. Here’s a breakdown of what to look for:</p>

<table>

        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>

            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Ensure they are not cross-contaminated.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Garlic</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Fresh garlic is gluten-free.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Thickeners (Modified Food Starch)</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>Often derived from wheat.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Vinegar</td>
            <td>Depends</td>
            <td>Malt vinegar contains gluten; others are safe.</td>
