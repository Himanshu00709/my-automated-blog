    <h1>Kettle Corn: A Gluten-Free Snack You’ll Love</h1>
    <p>Kettle corn is a beloved snack that combines the perfect balance of sweet and salty flavors. Whether you’re at a fair, a movie theater, or enjoying a cozy night at home, kettle corn is a treat that appeals to all ages. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding safe snacks can be a challenge. The good news? Kettle corn is naturally gluten-free, making it a delicious and worry-free option for anyone avoiding gluten. In this article, we’ll explore what makes kettle corn gluten-free, its nutritional benefits, and how you can enjoy it as part of a healthy diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Kettle Corn?</h2>
    <p>Kettle corn is a type of popcorn that is traditionally cooked in a large cast-iron kettle. It’s made by popping corn kernels in oil and then adding a mixture of sugar and salt. The result is a light, crispy snack with a delightful combination of sweet and savory flavors. Unlike regular popcorn, which is typically seasoned with just salt or butter, kettle corn has a unique taste that sets it apart.</p>

    <h2>Why is Kettle Corn Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Kettle corn is naturally gluten-free because its primary ingredients—corn kernels, oil, sugar, and salt—do not contain gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it’s commonly present in many processed foods. However, kettle corn is made from corn, which is a gluten-free grain. As long as no gluten-containing additives or cross-contamination occurs during processing, kettle corn remains a safe snack for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>
