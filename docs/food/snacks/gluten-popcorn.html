    <h1>Gluten-Free Popcorn: A Healthy Snack Option</h1>

    <p>Popcorn is a beloved snack enjoyed by millions around the world. Whether you're at the movies, hosting a game night, or simply craving a light snack, popcorn is a go-to option.

In this article, we'll explore what makes popcorn gluten-free, its health benefits, and how you can incorporate it into your diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Popcorn?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free popcorn is simply popcorn that has not been contaminated with gluten during processing or preparation. Popcorn itself is naturally gluten-free, as it is made from corn kernels.

Therefore, it's essential to choose popcorn that is specifically labeled as gluten-free to ensure it is safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>
