    <h2>What to Look for in a Gluten-Free Bar</h2>

    <p>Look for bars that are certified gluten-free by a reputable organization. This ensures that the product has been tested and meets strict gluten-free standards. Additionally, certifications like non-GMO, organic, and vegan can indicate a higher quality product.</p>

    <h3>4. Taste and Texture</h3>
    <p>While nutritional content is important, taste and texture also play a significant role in your enjoyment of the bar. Some gluten-free bars can be dry or overly dense, so it's worth trying a few different options to find one that you genuinely enjoy.</p>
