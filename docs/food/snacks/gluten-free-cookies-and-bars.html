        <li><strong>Experiment with Binders:</strong> Different binders can affect the texture of your baked goods. Experiment with xanthan gum, psyllium husk, or flaxseed meal to find the best option for your recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Parchment Paper:</strong> Lining your baking sheets with parchment paper can prevent sticking and make cleanup easier.</li>
