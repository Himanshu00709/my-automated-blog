<h2>What to Look for When Buying Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>

<p>When shopping for gluten-free cookies, it's important to consider more than just the absence of gluten. Here are some key factors to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Certification:</strong> Look for cookies that are certified gluten-free by a reputable organization. This ensures that the product meets strict gluten-free standards and is safe for those with celiac disease.</li>
    <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Check the ingredient list for high-quality, whole-food ingredients. Avoid cookies with artificial additives, preservatives, or excessive sugar.</li>
    <li><strong>Texture and Flavor:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can vary widely in texture and flavor. Some may be crumbly, while others are soft and chewy. Read reviews or try a few different brands to find your favorite.</li>
    <li><strong>Allergen Information:</strong> If you have other food allergies, make sure to check the allergen information on the packaging. Many gluten-free cookies are also free from common allergens like dairy, nuts, and soy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Store Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>

<p>Proper storage is key to maintaining the freshness and quality of your gluten-free cookies. Here are some tips to ensure your cookies stay delicious:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Airtight Containers:</strong> Store your cookies in an airtight container to prevent them from becoming stale or absorbing odors from other foods.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool, Dry Place:</strong> Keep your cookies in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Avoid storing them in the refrigerator, as this can cause them to become hard and lose their flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Freezing:</strong> If you have a large batch of cookies, consider freezing them. Place the cookies in a freezer-safe bag or container, and they can last for up to three months. When you're ready to enjoy them, simply let them thaw at room temperature.</li>
</ul>
