<h2>How Are Gluten-Free Pretzel Thins Made?</h2>

<p>The process of making gluten-free pretzel thins is similar to that of traditional pretzels, but with a few key differences. Instead of wheat flour, manufacturers use a blend of gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, tapioca flour, or almond flour. These flours are combined with water, yeast, and other ingredients to create a dough. The dough is then rolled out thinly, cut into the desired shape, and baked until crispy.</p>

<p>One of the challenges in making gluten-free pretzel thins is achieving the right texture. Without gluten, which provides elasticity and structure, the dough can be more fragile. To combat this, manufacturers often add binding agents like xanthan gum or psyllium husk to help the dough hold together. The result is a pretzel that is just as crunchy and satisfying as the traditional version, but without the gluten.</p>
