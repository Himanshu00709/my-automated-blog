    <h1>Gluten-Free Pepparkakor: A Delicious Holiday Treat</h1>
    <p>As the holiday season approaches, the aroma of freshly baked cookies fills the air. Among the many traditional treats, pepparkakor—Swedish ginger cookies—hold a special place. These thin, crispy, and spiced cookies are a staple in Scandinavian households during Christmas. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying these delights can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free pepparkakor, a delicious alternative that allows everyone to partake in the festive joy.</p>

    <h2>What Are Pepparkakor?</h2>
    <p>Pepparkakor, often referred to as Swedish ginger cookies, are thin, crisp biscuits flavored with a blend of warm spices such as ginger, cinnamon, and cloves. Traditionally, they are rolled out thinly and cut into various shapes, often hearts, stars, or Christmas trees. The name "pepparkakor" translates to "pepper cakes," a nod to the historical use of pepper in the recipe, which has since been replaced by other spices.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not only among those with medical conditions but also among people seeking healthier lifestyle choices. Gluten-free pepparkakor offer a way to enjoy this traditional treat without the adverse effects of gluten.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Pepparkakor</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free pepparkakor is similar to the traditional method, with a few adjustments to ensure the dough holds together without gluten. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, spices, and baking soda.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the molasses and mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. This helps the dough firm up and makes it easier to roll out.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll and Cut:</strong> Roll the dough out thinly between two sheets of parchment paper. Use cookie cutters to create your desired shapes.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly browned.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
