    <h1>Gluten-Free Brittle: A Delicious and Safe Treat</h1>
    <p>Brittle is a classic confectionery treat that has been enjoyed for generations. Traditionally made with sugar, nuts, and sometimes butter, brittle is known for its hard, crunchy texture and sweet flavor.

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Brittle</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free brittle is a straightforward process that requires careful attention to ingredient selection and cooking techniques. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare Your Ingredients:</strong> Measure out all your ingredients and ensure they are gluten-free. Double-check labels to avoid any hidden gluten sources.</li>

        <li><strong>Add Butter and Nuts:</strong> Once the sugar mixture reaches the desired temperature, remove it from the heat and quickly stir in the butter and nuts. Be cautious as the mixture will be extremely hot.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread and Cool:</strong> Pour the mixture onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and spread it evenly. Allow it to cool completely before breaking it into pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Store the brittle in an airtight container to maintain its crispness. It can be kept at room temperature for up to two weeks.</li>
    </ol>
