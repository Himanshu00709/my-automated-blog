    <h1>Starburst Gummies Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Starburst gummies have long been a favorite treat for candy lovers around the world. Known for their vibrant colors and fruity flavors, these chewy delights are a staple in many households. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding gluten-free candy can be a challenge. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about Starburst gummies and their gluten-free status, including ingredients, flavors, and where to find them.</p>

    <h2>What Are Starburst Gummies?</h2>

    <p>Starburst gummies are a chewy, fruit-flavored candy that comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. Unlike the original Starburst chews, which are square and wrapped in paper, the gummies are bite-sized and often shaped like fruit or other fun designs. They are known for their intense fruity flavors, which include strawberry, cherry, orange, and lemon, among others.</p>

    <p>The gummies are made with a combination of sugar, corn syrup, and gelatin, which gives them their signature chewy texture. They are also free from artificial flavors and colors, making them a slightly healthier option compared to other candies on the market.</p>

    <h2>Are Starburst Gummies Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>However, it’s important to note that while the gummies themselves are gluten-free, they may be produced in facilities that also process gluten-containing products. This could potentially lead to cross-contamination, although the risk is generally low. If you have a severe gluten allergy or celiac disease, it’s always a good idea to check the packaging for any allergen warnings or contact the manufacturer directly for more information.</p>
