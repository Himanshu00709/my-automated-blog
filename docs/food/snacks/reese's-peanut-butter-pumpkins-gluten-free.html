    <h1>Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins: A Gluten-Free Halloween Treat</h1>

    <p>Halloween is a time for spooky decorations, creative costumes, and, of course, delicious treats. Among the many seasonal candies available, Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins stand out as a fan favorite. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Are Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and everything you need to know about these iconic Halloween treats.</p>

    <h2>What Are Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins?</h2>

    <p>Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins are a seasonal variation of the classic Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Shaped like tiny pumpkins, these treats combine the rich, creamy peanut butter filling with a smooth milk chocolate coating. They are a staple in many households during the Halloween season, offering a festive twist on a beloved candy.</p>

    <p>But what makes these pumpkins so special? It’s not just their adorable shape—it’s the perfect balance of sweet and salty flavors that has made Reese's a household name. Whether you’re handing them out to trick-or-treaters or indulging in a personal stash, Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins are a must-have for any Halloween celebration.</p>

    <h2>Are Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>For individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, determining whether a product is gluten-free is crucial. The good news is that Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins are generally considered gluten-free. However, it’s important to understand the details behind this claim.</p>

    <p>Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins are made with simple ingredients: milk chocolate, peanuts, sugar, dextrose, salt, and TBHQ (a preservative). None of these ingredients contain gluten. Additionally, Reese's has stated that their peanut butter cups, including the seasonal shapes like pumpkins, do not contain any gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

    <p>However, it’s worth noting that Reese's products are manufactured in facilities that also process gluten-containing ingredients. This means there is a potential risk of cross-contamination. For most people with gluten sensitivities, this level of cross-contamination is negligible, but those with severe celiac disease may want to exercise caution.</p>
