    <h2>How to Make a Gluten-Free Chipwich</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your own gluten-free chipwich:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Cookies:</strong> Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Chipwich:</strong> Once the cookies are cool, place a scoop of ice cream on the flat side of one cookie. Top with another cookie, pressing gently to form a sandwich. Repeat with the remaining cookies and ice cream.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve or Freeze:</strong> You can serve the chipwiches immediately or wrap them individually in plastic wrap and freeze for later enjoyment.</li>
    </ol>
