    <h2>Nutritional Considerations for Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>

    <p>When choosing gluten-free cookies, it’s important to consider their nutritional content. Many gluten-free products are higher in sugar and fat to compensate for the lack of gluten, which can affect texture and taste. Here are some key nutritional factors to keep in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugar Content:</strong> Look for cookies with lower sugar content or those sweetened with natural alternatives like honey or maple syrup.</li>
        <li><strong>Fiber:</strong> Some gluten-free cookies are made with high-fiber ingredients like oats or flaxseed, which can help with digestion.</li>
        <li><strong>Protein:</strong> Cookies made with almond or chickpea flour tend to have higher protein content, making them a more satisfying snack.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthy Fats:</strong> Opt for cookies that use healthy fats like coconut oil or avocado oil instead of trans fats or hydrogenated oils.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Choose the Best Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>

    <p>With so many options available, choosing the best gluten-free cookies can be overwhelming. Here are some tips to help you make an informed decision:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Check the Ingredients List:</strong> Look for cookies made with whole, recognizable ingredients. Avoid those with long lists of artificial additives or preservatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider Your Dietary Needs:</strong> If you have other dietary restrictions, such as dairy-free or nut-free, make sure the cookies you choose meet those requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Read Reviews:</strong> Online reviews can provide valuable insights into the taste and texture of different gluten-free cookies.</li>
