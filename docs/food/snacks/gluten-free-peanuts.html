    <h1>Gluten-Free Peanuts: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders such as celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Among the many foods that people are curious about, peanuts often come up in discussions. Are peanuts gluten-free? Can they be safely consumed by those with gluten intolerance?
