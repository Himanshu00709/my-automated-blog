<h1>Store-Bought Gluten-Free Snacks: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the growing popularity of gluten-free diets. For those who need or choose to avoid gluten, finding convenient and tasty snacks can be a challenge. Fortunately, the market has responded with a wide array of store-bought gluten-free snacks that cater to various tastes and dietary needs.

Even those without specific medical conditions may choose gluten-free snacks as part of a healthier lifestyle. However, it’s important to note that not all gluten-free snacks are created equal. Some may be high in sugar, unhealthy fats, or lack essential nutrients. Therefore, understanding what to look for is crucial.</p>
