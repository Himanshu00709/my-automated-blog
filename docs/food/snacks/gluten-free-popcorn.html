    <h1>Gluten-Free Popcorn: A Healthy Snack for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Popcorn is one of the most beloved snacks worldwide, and for good reason. It’s light, crunchy, and can be customized to suit any taste preference. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding safe snacks can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free popcorn—a delicious, healthy, and safe option for everyone. In this article, we’ll explore what makes popcorn gluten-free, its health benefits, and how to enjoy it in various ways.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Popcorn Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Popcorn is naturally gluten-free because it is made from whole corn kernels. Corn, unlike wheat, barley, and rye, does not contain gluten. However, the way popcorn is processed, flavored, or prepared can sometimes introduce gluten. For example, pre-packaged popcorn or microwave popcorn may contain additives, flavorings, or cross-contamination risks that make them unsafe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <p>To ensure your popcorn is gluten-free, always check the label for certifications or look for brands that specifically state they are gluten-free. Alternatively, you can make your own popcorn at home using plain corn kernels and gluten-free seasonings.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Popcorn</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free popcorn isn’t just safe for those with gluten sensitivities—it’s also packed with nutritional benefits. Here are some reasons why popcorn is a great addition to your diet:</p>

                <td>Rich in Antioxidants</td>
