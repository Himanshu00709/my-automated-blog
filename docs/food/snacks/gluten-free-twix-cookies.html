    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Twix Cookies</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free Twix cookies at home is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create your own batch of delicious, gluten-free treats:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cookie Base</h3>
    <p>Start by mixing your gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, butter, and sugar in a bowl. Combine until the mixture forms a dough. Roll out the dough and cut it into rectangular shapes, similar to the size of a Twix bar. Bake the cookies until they are golden brown and let them cool completely.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Caramel Layer</h3>
    <p>While the cookies are cooling, prepare the caramel. Heat sugar in a saucepan until it melts and turns golden brown. Carefully add cream and butter, stirring until the mixture is smooth. Let the caramel cool slightly before spreading it over the cookie bases.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Coat with Chocolate</h3>
    <p>Once the caramel has set, melt your choice of gluten-free chocolate. Dip each cookie into the melted chocolate, ensuring it's fully coated. Place the cookies on a parchment-lined tray and let the chocolate harden.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Twix Cookies</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Ingredients:</strong> The quality of your gluten-free flour blend and chocolate will significantly impact the final product.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Chilling the dough before baking helps prevent spreading, ensuring your cookies maintain their shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Patient with Caramel:</strong> Making caramel can be tricky, so take your time to avoid burning the sugar.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Twix Cookies</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Are gluten-free Twix cookies healthier than regular Twix bars?</h3>
        <p>While gluten-free Twix cookies are a great option for those avoiding gluten, they are still a treat and should be enjoyed in moderation. They contain sugar and butter, so they are not necessarily healthier than regular Twix bars.</p>

        <h3>Can I use store-bought caramel for gluten-free Twix cookies?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use store-bought caramel to save time. Just ensure it's labeled gluten-free to avoid any cross-contamination.</p>

        <h3>How long do gluten-free Twix cookies last?</h3>
        <p>When stored in an airtight container, gluten-free Twix cookies can last up to a week at room temperature. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to a month.</p>
