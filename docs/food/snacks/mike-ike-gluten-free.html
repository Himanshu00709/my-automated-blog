    <h1>Mike and Ike Gluten-Free: A Detailed Guide</h1>
    <p>Mike and Ike candies have been a beloved treat for decades, known for their vibrant colors and fruity flavors. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether these candies are gluten-free is crucial. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about Mike and Ike candies, their gluten-free status, and what makes them a safe or risky choice for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>What Are Mike and Ike Candies?</h2>
    <p>Mike and Ike candies are chewy, fruit-flavored candies that come in a variety of flavors and colors. They are produced by the Just Born company, which is also known for other popular candies like Peeps and Hot Tamales. The candies are small, oblong, and come in a box, making them a convenient snack for on-the-go enjoyment.</p>

    <h2>Are Mike and Ike Candies Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>The good news for gluten-sensitive individuals is that most Mike and Ike candies are gluten-free. According to the manufacturer, Just Born, the candies do not contain any gluten ingredients. However, it’s important to note that they are not certified gluten-free, which means there could be a risk of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients in Mike and Ike Candies</h3>
    <p>To better understand the gluten-free status of Mike and Ike candies, let’s take a closer look at their ingredients. The primary ingredients include:</p>

        <li>Corn syrup</li>
        <li>Modified food starch</li>
        <li>Citric acid</li>
        <li>Natural and artificial flavors</li>

However, the modified food starch could be a point of concern, as it can sometimes be derived from wheat. In the case of Mike and Ike, the modified food starch is derived from corn, making it gluten-free.</p>

However, they also acknowledge that they cannot guarantee that their products are completely free from gluten due to the possibility of cross-contamination. This is an important consideration for those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance.</p>
