    <h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Snacks: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free and dairy-free snacks has surged, driven by increasing awareness of food intolerances, allergies, and dietary preferences. Whether you're managing celiac disease, lactose intolerance, or simply exploring a healthier lifestyle, finding delicious and nutritious snacks that fit your dietary needs can be challenging. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about gluten and dairy-free snacks, including options, benefits, and tips for incorporating them into your daily routine.</p>

    <p>Choosing gluten and dairy-free snacks can help alleviate these symptoms, improve digestion, and support overall health. Additionally, many gluten and dairy-free snacks are made with whole, nutrient-dense ingredients, making them a healthier choice for everyone, not just those with dietary restrictions.</p>
