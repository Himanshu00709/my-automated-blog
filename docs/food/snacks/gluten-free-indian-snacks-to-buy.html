<h1>Gluten-Free Indian Snacks: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Indian cuisine is renowned for its rich flavors, diverse ingredients, and vibrant spices. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, navigating Indian snacks can be a challenge. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free options has made it easier to enjoy traditional Indian snacks without compromising on taste or health. In this blog post, we’ll explore some of the best gluten-free Indian snacks you can buy, along with tips on what to look for when shopping.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Indian Snacks?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in people with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease.

Choosing gluten-free snacks not only helps in managing dietary restrictions but also promotes a healthier lifestyle by reducing processed ingredients.</p>
