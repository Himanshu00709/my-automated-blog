    <h1>Gluten-Free Curly Fries: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>Curly fries are a beloved snack and side dish, known for their unique spiral shape and crispy texture. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying traditional curly fries can be a challenge due to the presence of gluten in the coating or frying process. Fortunately, gluten-free curly fries have emerged as a delicious and safe alternative, allowing everyone to indulge in this tasty treat without compromising their health. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free curly fries, from their benefits to how you can make them at home.</p>

    <p>These fries are typically seasoned with a blend of spices, such as paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder, to give them their signature flavor. They can be baked or fried, depending on your preference, and are often served with gluten-free dipping sauces like ketchup, ranch, or aioli.</p>
