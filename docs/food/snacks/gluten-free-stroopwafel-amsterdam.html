<h1>Gluten-Free Stroopwafel in Amsterdam: A Delicious Guide</h1>

<p>Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, is renowned for its picturesque canals, historic architecture, and vibrant culture. But for food enthusiasts, Amsterdam is also a paradise for indulging in traditional Dutch treats. One such iconic delicacy is the stroopwafel—a thin, crispy waffle filled with a gooey caramel syrup. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free version of this beloved treat can be a challenge. In this guide, we’ll explore the best places to find gluten-free stroopwafels in Amsterdam, along with tips, recipes, and FAQs to satisfy your cravings.</p>

<h2>What is a Stroopwafel?</h2>

<p>The stroopwafel, which translates to "syrup waffle," is a traditional Dutch cookie made from two thin layers of baked dough with a caramel-like syrup filling in the middle. Originating in the city of Gouda in the late 18th century, stroopwafels have become a staple in Dutch cuisine and are enjoyed worldwide. The classic stroopwafel is made with wheat flour, which contains gluten, making it unsuitable for those with gluten intolerance. Fortunately, Amsterdam has embraced the gluten-free movement, and several bakeries and cafes now offer gluten-free stroopwafels.</p>
