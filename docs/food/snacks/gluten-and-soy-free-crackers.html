    <h2>Why Choose Gluten and Soy-Free Crackers?</h2>

    <p>Gluten and soy-free crackers are an excellent choice for individuals with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or soy allergies.

Similarly, soy, a common allergen, can trigger allergic reactions in some individuals. By opting for gluten and soy-free crackers, you can enjoy a tasty snack without worrying about adverse reactions.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gluten and soy-free crackers are often made with whole, nutrient-dense ingredients, making them a healthier alternative to traditional crackers. They are typically lower in processed sugars and unhealthy fats, and they may contain higher levels of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. This makes them a great option for anyone looking to maintain a balanced diet.</p>

    <h2>Key Ingredients in Gluten and Soy-Free Crackers</h2>

    <p>Gluten and soy-free crackers are made from a variety of alternative flours and ingredients that do not contain gluten or soy. Some of the most common ingredients include:</p>

        <li><strong>Almond Flour:</strong> A popular gluten-free flour made from ground almonds, rich in healthy fats, protein, and fiber.</li>
        <li><strong>Coconut Flour:</strong> Made from dried coconut meat, this flour is high in fiber and low in carbohydrates.</li>
        <li><strong>Quinoa Flour:</strong> Derived from quinoa, this flour is a complete protein source and is rich in essential amino acids.</li>
        <li><strong>Chia Seeds:</strong> These tiny seeds are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and antioxidants.</li>
        <li><strong>Flaxseeds:</strong> Another excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids and fiber, flaxseeds add a nutty flavor to crackers.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown Rice Flour:</strong> A versatile gluten-free flour that provides a mild flavor and a good source of carbohydrates.</li>
    </ul>
