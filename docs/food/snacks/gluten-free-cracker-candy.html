    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free cracker candy is surprisingly simple. Follow these steps to create your own batch:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Arrange the Crackers</h3>
    <p>Arrange the gluten-free crackers in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Make sure they are evenly spaced and cover the entire sheet.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Topping</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the brown sugar and stir continuously until the mixture comes to a boil. Let it boil for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burning.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Pour the Topping Over the Crackers</h3>
    <p>Carefully pour the hot butter and sugar mixture over the arranged crackers. Use a spatula to spread it evenly, ensuring all the crackers are coated.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 5-7 minutes, or until the topping is bubbly and slightly caramelized.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Add the Chocolate</h3>
    <p>Remove the baking sheet from the oven and immediately sprinkle the chocolate chips over the hot crackers. Let the chocolate sit for a minute or two to melt, then use a spatula to spread it evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Add Optional Toppings</h3>
    <p>If desired, sprinkle your choice of toppings (such as chopped nuts or sprinkles) over the melted chocolate.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Break into Pieces</h3>
    <p>Allow the cracker candy to cool completely at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Once cooled, break it into pieces and enjoy!</p>
