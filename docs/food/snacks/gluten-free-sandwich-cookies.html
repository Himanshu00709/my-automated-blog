    <h1>Gluten-Free Sandwich Cookies: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>In recent years, gluten-free diets have gained immense popularity, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also among health-conscious individuals.

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Sandwich Cookies?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free sandwich cookies are essentially two cookies with a filling in between, similar to the classic sandwich cookies we all know and love.

    <p>Making gluten-free sandwich cookies can be a bit tricky, especially if you're new to gluten-free baking. Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect cookies:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Different gluten-free flours have different textures and flavors. Experiment with a few to find the one that works best for your recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Chilling the dough before baking helps prevent the cookies from spreading too much in the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Parchment Paper:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can be more delicate, so using parchment paper will help prevent them from sticking to the baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Let Them Cool Completely:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool completely before adding the filling to prevent it from melting or sliding off.</li>
    </ul>
