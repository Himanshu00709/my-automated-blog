    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Zebra Cakes</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free zebra cakes is a fun and rewarding process. Follow these steps to create your own:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and greasing a cake pan. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Divide the Batter</h3>

    <p>Divide the batter into two equal portions. In one portion, mix in the cocoa powder until fully incorporated. This will be your chocolate batter. Leave the other portion as the vanilla batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Create the Zebra Pattern</h3>

    <p>To create the zebra pattern, alternate spoonfuls of the vanilla and chocolate batter into the center of the prepared cake pan. As you add each spoonful, the batter will spread out, creating concentric circles. Continue alternating until all the batter is used up.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Cake</h3>

    <p>Bake the cake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once the cake has cooled, slice it and serve. You can enjoy it as is or with a dusting of powdered sugar, a dollop of whipped cream, or a drizzle of chocolate sauce.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Zebra Cakes</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free zebra cakes turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking and includes a mix of flours like rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense and tough cake. Mix the batter until just combined to ensure a light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure Ingredients Accurately:</strong> Baking is a science, so it's important to measure your ingredients accurately. Use a kitchen scale for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> While the classic zebra cake features vanilla and chocolate, you can experiment with other flavors like lemon, strawberry, or matcha for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Zebra Cakes</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make gluten-free zebra cakes without eggs?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make gluten-free zebra cakes without eggs by using egg substitutes like flax eggs, chia eggs, or commercial egg replacers. Keep in mind that the texture may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour can be used, but it will result in a denser and moister cake. If you prefer a lighter texture, it's best to use a gluten-free flour blend that includes a mix of flours.</p>

        <h3>How do I store gluten-free zebra cakes?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free zebra cakes can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, wrap the cake tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make gluten-free zebra cakes in advance?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make gluten-free zebra cakes in advance. Simply bake the cake, allow it to cool completely, and store it in an airtight container. You can also freeze the cake and thaw it before serving.</p>
