    <h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Snacks: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free and dairy-free snacks has surged, driven by increasing awareness of food intolerances, allergies, and dietary preferences. Whether you're managing celiac disease, lactose intolerance, or simply exploring a healthier lifestyle, finding delicious and nutritious snacks that fit your dietary needs can be challenging. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about gluten and dairy-free snacks, from understanding the basics to discovering mouth-watering options.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Dairy-Free Diets</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, which can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Dairy, on the other hand, contains lactose, a sugar that many people have difficulty digesting. A gluten and dairy-free diet eliminates these components, focusing on whole, unprocessed foods that are naturally free from these allergens.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten and Dairy-Free Snacks</h2>
    <p>Adopting a gluten and dairy-free diet can offer numerous health benefits, including improved digestion, reduced inflammation, and better nutrient absorption. For those with specific medical conditions, such as celiac disease or lactose intolerance, these dietary changes are essential for maintaining overall health. Additionally, many people report increased energy levels and clearer skin after eliminating gluten and dairy from their diets.</p>
