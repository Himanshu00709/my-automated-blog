    <h1>Gushers Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gushers, the iconic fruit snack known for its burst of liquid-filled goodness, has been a favorite among kids and adults alike for decades. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Gushers are gluten-free is a pressing one. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the world of Gushers, exploring their ingredients, gluten-free status, and what makes them a safe (or potentially risky) choice for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gushers?</h2>

    <p>Gushers are a type of fruit snack produced by General Mills under the Betty Crocker brand. They are small, chewy candies filled with a liquid center that "gushes" out when bitten into. Available in a variety of fruit flavors, Gushers are a popular treat for lunchboxes, parties, and on-the-go snacking.</p>

    <h2>Are Gushers Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>The good news for gluten-free snackers is that Gushers are indeed gluten-free. According to the manufacturer, General Mills, Gushers do not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, it’s important to note that while the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. General Mills does not label Gushers as certified gluten-free, so individuals with severe gluten allergies or celiac disease should exercise caution.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Gushers</h2>

    <p>Understanding the ingredients in Gushers can help you make an informed decision about whether they fit into your gluten-free diet. Here’s a breakdown of the typical ingredients found in Gushers:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Pear Puree Concentrate</td>
                <td>Provides natural sweetness and fruit flavor</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Corn Syrup</td>
                <td>Adds sweetness and chewiness</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sugar</td>
                <td>Sweetens the snack</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Modified Corn Starch</td>
                <td>Thickens the liquid center</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Citric Acid</td>
                <td>Adds tartness and acts as a preservative</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Natural and Artificial Flavors</td>
                <td>Enhances the fruit flavors</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Color Additives</td>
                <td>Provides vibrant colors</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Potential Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>While the ingredients in Gushers are gluten-free, cross-contamination is always a concern for those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance. General Mills does not specifically label Gushers as certified gluten-free, which means there is a possibility that they could come into contact with gluten-containing products during manufacturing. If you have a severe gluten allergy, it’s best to consult with your healthcare provider before consuming Gushers.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Information</h2>

    <p>Gushers are a fun and tasty treat, but they are not exactly a health food. Here’s a look at the nutritional content of a typical serving of Gushers:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Nutrient</th>
                <th>Amount Per Serving</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Calories</td>
                <td>90</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Total Fat</td>
                <td>1g</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sodium</td>
                <td>45mg</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Total Carbohydrates</td>
                <td>21g</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sugars</td>
                <td>13g</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Protein</td>
                <td>0g</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As you can see, Gushers are high in sugar and low in protein and fiber, making them more of an occasional treat rather than a daily snack.</p>
