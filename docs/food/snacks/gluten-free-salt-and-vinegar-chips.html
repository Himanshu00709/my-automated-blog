<h1>Gluten-Free Salt and Vinegar Chips: A Crunchy Delight</h1>

<p>For those who love the tangy, salty crunch of salt and vinegar chips but need to avoid gluten, the good news is that gluten-free options are more accessible than ever. Whether you're managing celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply choosing a gluten-free lifestyle, you don't have to miss out on this classic snack. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free salt and vinegar chips, from their ingredients and nutritional value to popular brands and how to make them at home.</p>

<h2>What Makes Salt and Vinegar Chips Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Salt and vinegar chips are typically made from potatoes, oil, salt, and vinegar seasoning. The key to ensuring they are gluten-free lies in the ingredients and the manufacturing process. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, so any chip that avoids these ingredients and cross-contamination during production can be considered gluten-free.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown of the typical ingredients in gluten-free salt and vinegar chips:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Ingredient</th>
            <th>Role</th>
            <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Potatoes</td>
            <td>Base ingredient</td>
            <td>Naturally gluten-free</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Vegetable Oil</td>
            <td>Frying medium</td>
            <td>Naturally gluten-free</td>
        </tr>

            <td>Additional flavors</td>
            <td>Must be gluten-free</td>
        </tr>
