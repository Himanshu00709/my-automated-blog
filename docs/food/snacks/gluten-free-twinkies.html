    <h1>Gluten-Free Twinkies: A Delicious Twist on a Classic Treat</h1>

    <p>For decades, Twinkies have been a beloved snack, known for their golden sponge cake and creamy filling. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic treat has been off the table—until now. Enter gluten-free Twinkies, a modern twist on the iconic snack that allows everyone to indulge without worry. In this article, we’ll explore the rise of gluten-free Twinkies, their ingredients, nutritional benefits, and how they compare to the original. Whether you’re gluten-free by necessity or choice, this is a treat you won’t want to miss.</p>

    <h2>The Rise of Gluten-Free Twinkies</h2>

    <p>The demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed in recent years, driven by increased awareness of celiac disease and gluten intolerance. According to the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness, approximately 1 in 100 people worldwide suffer from celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten. Additionally, many individuals without celiac disease choose to avoid gluten due to perceived health benefits or sensitivities.</p>

    <p>Recognizing this growing market, Hostess Brands, the maker of Twinkies, decided to create a gluten-free version of their iconic snack. Launched in 2021, gluten-free Twinkies quickly gained popularity among those who had long missed out on the joy of biting into a soft, creamy Twinkie. The product was developed using alternative flours like rice flour and tapioca starch, ensuring it met the strict gluten-free standards while maintaining the classic taste and texture.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients and Nutritional Profile</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free Twinkies are made with a carefully curated list of ingredients to ensure they are safe for those with gluten sensitivities. Here’s a breakdown of the key components:</p>

    <table>
