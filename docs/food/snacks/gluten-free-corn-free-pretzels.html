    <h1>Gluten-Free, Corn-Free Pretzels: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free and corn-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of food sensitivities, allergies, and dietary preferences. Among the many snacks that have been reimagined to meet these needs, pretzels stand out as a beloved treat that many thought they had to give up. However, with the rise of gluten-free and corn-free pretzels, snack lovers can once again enjoy this crunchy delight without compromising their health or dietary restrictions.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free, Corn-Free Pretzels?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free, corn-free pretzels are a specialized snack designed for individuals who cannot tolerate gluten or corn. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, while corn is a common allergen and a frequent ingredient in many processed foods. Traditional pretzels are made from wheat flour, which contains gluten, and often include corn syrup or cornstarch as a sweetener or binding agent. Gluten-free, corn-free pretzels, on the other hand, are crafted using alternative flours and ingredients that are safe for those with gluten intolerance or corn allergies.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free, Corn-Free Pretzels?</h2>

    <p>There are several reasons why someone might opt for gluten-free, corn-free pretzels:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Celiac Disease:</strong> Individuals with celiac disease must avoid gluten to prevent damage to their small intestine.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten Sensitivity:</strong> Some people experience symptoms like bloating, headaches, and fatigue when they consume gluten, even if they don't have celiac disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Corn Allergy:</strong> Corn is a common allergen, and those with a corn allergy must avoid it to prevent allergic reactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Dietary Preferences:</strong> Some people choose to avoid gluten and corn for personal health reasons or as part of a specific diet, such as paleo or autoimmune protocol (AIP).</li>
    </ul>
