    <h1>Gluten-Free and Dairy-Free Crackers: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free and dairy-free products has skyrocketed, driven by increasing awareness of food intolerances, allergies, and dietary preferences. Among these products, gluten-free and dairy-free crackers have emerged as a popular snack option for those seeking healthier, allergen-free alternatives. Whether you're managing celiac disease, lactose intolerance, or simply exploring a new dietary lifestyle, this guide will provide you with everything you need to know about gluten-free and dairy-free crackers.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free crackers are typically made from alternative flours like rice, almond, coconut, or chickpea flour.
