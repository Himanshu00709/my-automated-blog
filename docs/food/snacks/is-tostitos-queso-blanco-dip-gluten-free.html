    </table>

    <p>From the table above, it’s clear that the primary ingredients in Tostitos Queso Blanco Dip are gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that some ingredients, like maltodextrin, can sometimes be derived from wheat, though this is rare. In the case of Tostitos Queso Blanco Dip, the maltodextrin used is derived from corn, making it safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can be a concern. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free products come into contact with gluten-containing products or surfaces during production. This can happen in facilities that process both gluten-free and gluten-containing foods.</p>

    <p>According to Frito-Lay, the company that produces Tostitos, they have stringent measures in place to prevent cross-contamination. However, they also state that they cannot guarantee that their products are 100% gluten-free due to the shared equipment and facilities. Therefore, individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease should exercise caution.</p>

    <h2>Certifications and Labels</h2>

    <p>One way to ensure that a product is gluten-free is to look for certifications from recognized organizations. Tostitos Queso Blanco Dip does not carry a gluten-free certification, such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO) seal. However, the product is labeled as gluten-free on the packaging, which indicates that it meets the FDA’s standard of containing less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</p>
