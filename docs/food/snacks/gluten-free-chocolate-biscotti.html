    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free chocolate biscotti:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Beat Eggs and Sugar:</strong> In another bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract and mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Fold in the dark chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Divide the dough in half and shape each portion into a log about 12 inches long. Place the logs on the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between them.</li>
        <li><strong>First Bake:</strong> Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the logs are firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Slice the Biscotti:</strong> Using a serrated knife, slice the logs diagonally into 1/2-inch thick slices.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Bake:</strong> Place the slices cut-side down on the baking sheet and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until crisp. Let cool completely before serving.</li>
