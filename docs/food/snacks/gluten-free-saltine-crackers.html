    <h1>Gluten-Free Saltine Crackers: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Saltine crackers have long been a staple in pantries around the world. Known for their crisp texture and versatility, they are often used as a snack, a base for appetizers, or even as a remedy for an upset stomach. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, traditional saltine crackers are off-limits due to their wheat-based ingredients. Enter gluten-free saltine crackers—a game-changer for those who need to avoid gluten but still crave the classic crunch of a saltine.

These crackers are typically seasoned with salt and sometimes other flavorings to mimic the taste and texture of traditional saltines.</p>
