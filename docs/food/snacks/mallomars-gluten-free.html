    <h1>Mallomars Gluten-Free: A Delicious Treat for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Mallomars, the iconic marshmallow and chocolate cookie, have been a beloved treat for generations. Known for their soft, pillowy marshmallow center and rich chocolate coating, Mallomars have a unique place in the hearts of cookie lovers. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying these treats has often been off the table—until now. The introduction of gluten-free Mallomars has opened up a world of indulgence for those who previously had to avoid them. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free Mallomars, from their ingredients to their availability, and why they’re a game-changer for gluten-free diets.</p>

    <h2>What Are Mallomars?</h2>

    <p>Mallomars are a classic American cookie that first hit the market in 1913. They consist of a round graham cracker base topped with a generous dollop of marshmallow, all enrobed in a layer of rich chocolate. The combination of textures—crunchy, chewy, and creamy—makes them a unique and irresistible treat. Traditionally, Mallomars are a seasonal product, available primarily from September to March, which adds to their allure and makes them a highly anticipated treat during the colder months.</p>

    <h2>The Gluten-Free Revolution</h2>

    <p>For years, Mallomars were off-limits to those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease due to the graham cracker base, which contains wheat flour. However, as the demand for gluten-free products has grown, Nabisco, the maker of Mallomars, has responded by introducing a gluten-free version of this classic cookie. This new iteration replaces the traditional graham cracker with a gluten-free alternative, allowing everyone to enjoy the delightful combination of marshmallow and chocolate without the worry of gluten-related health issues.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Gluten-Free Mallomars</h2>

    <p>The gluten-free version of Mallomars maintains the same delicious taste and texture as the original, but with a few key ingredient substitutions to make them safe for those avoiding gluten. Here’s a breakdown of the ingredients you’ll find in gluten-free Mallomars:</p>
