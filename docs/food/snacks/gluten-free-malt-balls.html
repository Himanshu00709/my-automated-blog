    <h1>Gluten-Free Malt Balls: A Delicious and Safe Treat</h1>

    <p>For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding delicious snacks that are safe to eat can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free malt balls—a delightful treat that combines the nostalgic taste of malt with the assurance of being gluten-free. In this article, we’ll explore what gluten-free malt balls are, their benefits, and how they compare to traditional malt balls. We’ll also provide tips on where to find them and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Malt Balls?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free malt balls are a variation of the classic malt ball, which is typically made with malted barley—a source of gluten. In gluten-free versions, the malted barley is replaced with gluten-free ingredients such as rice malt or other gluten-free grains. These balls are then coated in chocolate, creating a crunchy, sweet, and satisfying snack that’s safe for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <p>The process of making gluten-free malt balls involves careful selection of ingredients to ensure that no cross-contamination occurs during production. This makes them a reliable option for individuals who need to adhere to a strict gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Malt Balls</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free malt balls offer several benefits, especially for those with dietary restrictions. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>

    <h2>How Do Gluten-Free Malt Balls Compare to Traditional Malt Balls?</h2>

    <p>Traditional malt balls are made with malted barley, which contains gluten. This makes them unsuitable for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.

While traditional malt balls rely on barley, gluten-free versions often use rice malt or other gluten-free grains. This substitution does not compromise the overall taste or texture, making gluten-free malt balls a great alternative.</p>
