    <h1>Sour Candy Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding delicious treats that are safe to eat can be a challenge. Sour candies, with their tangy and sweet flavors, are a favorite among many. But are they gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free sour candies, what to look for, and some of the best options available on the market today.</p>

    <h2>What Does Gluten-Free Mean?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health problems. Gluten-free products are those that do not contain any gluten-containing ingredients and are processed in a way that avoids cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Are Sour Candies Typically Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Many sour candies are naturally gluten-free, but it’s essential to check the ingredients and manufacturing processes. Some candies may contain gluten as a thickening agent or may be processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products. Always look for labels that explicitly state "gluten-free" to ensure safety.</p>
