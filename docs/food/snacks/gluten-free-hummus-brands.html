    <h1>Gluten-Free Hummus Brands: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Hummus, a creamy and flavorful dip made from chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, and spices, has become a staple in many households. For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding gluten-free hummus is essential. Fortunately, many brands now offer gluten-free options, ensuring that everyone can enjoy this delicious and nutritious snack. In this article, we’ll explore some of the best gluten-free hummus brands available, discuss what makes them stand out, and provide tips for choosing the right one for your needs.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Hummus?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. While hummus is naturally gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing or the addition of gluten-containing ingredients can make some brands unsafe for those avoiding gluten. Choosing certified gluten-free hummus ensures that you’re consuming a product that meets strict gluten-free standards, typically containing less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</p>
