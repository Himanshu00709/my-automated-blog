<h1>Puffcorn Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free snacks has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of gluten intolerance and celiac disease. Among the many gluten-free options available, puffcorn has emerged as a popular choice for those seeking a delicious and safe snack. But what exactly is puffcorn, and why is it a great gluten-free option?

This process involves forcing cornmeal through a machine under high pressure and temperature, resulting in a puffed, crunchy snack that is both flavorful and satisfying.</p>

<p>One of the key advantages of puffcorn is that it is naturally gluten-free. Since it is made from cornmeal, which does not contain gluten, puffcorn is a safe option for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Additionally, puffcorn is often available in a variety of flavors, making it a versatile snack that can cater to different taste preferences.</p>
