    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Protein Balls</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free protein balls at home is simple and allows you to customize the ingredients to suit your taste and dietary needs. Here's a basic recipe to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup gluten-free oats</li>
        <li>1/2 cup nut butter (e.g., almond, peanut, or cashew)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey or maple syrup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup protein powder (gluten-free)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chia seeds or flaxseeds</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dried fruits (e.g., raisins, cranberries, or chopped dates)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dark chocolate chips (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free oats, nut butter, honey or maple syrup, and protein powder. Mix well until the ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Add the chia seeds or flaxseeds, dried fruits, and dark chocolate chips (if using). Stir until everything is well combined.</li>
        <li>Using your hands, roll the mixture into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter. If the mixture is too sticky, you can wet your hands slightly to make rolling easier.</li>
        <li>Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to firm up.</li>
        <li>Once firm, transfer the protein balls to an airtight container and store them in the refrigerator for up to a week.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Protein Balls</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Are gluten-free protein balls suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free protein balls can be made vegan by using plant-based protein powder and substituting honey with maple syrup or another vegan sweetener.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make gluten-free protein balls without nuts?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you have a nut allergy, you can use seed butter (like sunflower seed butter) instead of nut butter. You can also omit nuts entirely and rely on seeds and oats for texture.</p>

        <h3>3. How long do gluten-free protein balls last?</h3>
        <p>When stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator, gluten-free protein balls can last up to a week. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to three months.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I use fresh fruits instead of dried fruits?</h3>
        <p>Fresh fruits can add too much moisture to the mixture, making it difficult to form the balls. Stick to dried fruits for the best results.</p>

        <h3>5. Are gluten-free protein balls keto-friendly?</h3>
        <p>Traditional gluten-free protein balls may not be keto-friendly due to the presence of oats and natural sweeteners. However, you can modify the recipe by using low-carb ingredients like almond flour, coconut flour, and sugar-free sweeteners to make them keto-compliant.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free protein balls are a versatile, nutritious, and delicious snack that can easily fit into any lifestyle. Whether you're looking for a quick energy boost, a post-workout recovery snack, or a healthy treat to satisfy your sweet tooth, these protein balls are a fantastic option.
