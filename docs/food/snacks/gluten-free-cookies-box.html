    <h1>Gluten-Free Cookies Box: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and for good reason. Whether you're managing celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply opting for a healthier lifestyle, gluten-free cookies have become a popular choice.

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free cookies are baked goods made without gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. These cookies are crafted using alternative flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, rice flour, or oat flour (certified gluten-free). They are perfect for individuals with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or those who simply prefer a gluten-free diet. Despite the absence of gluten, these cookies can be just as delicious and satisfying as their traditional counterparts.</p>
