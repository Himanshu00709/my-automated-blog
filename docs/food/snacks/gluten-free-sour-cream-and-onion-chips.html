    <h1>Gluten-Free Sour Cream and Onion Chips: A Delicious and Healthy Snack Option</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of gluten intolerance and celiac disease. Among the many gluten-free snacks available, sour cream and onion chips have emerged as a popular choice for those seeking a flavorful yet safe option. These chips offer the perfect blend of tangy sour cream and savory onion flavors, all while being free from gluten. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free sour cream and onion chips, their benefits, and how they compare to traditional chips.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Sour Cream and Onion Chips Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Traditional sour cream and onion chips are typically made from potatoes or corn, which are naturally gluten-free.

Gluten-free sour cream and onion chips, on the other hand, use alternative ingredients to achieve the same delicious flavor without compromising on safety for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <p>The key to making gluten-free sour cream and onion chips lies in the seasoning. Manufacturers use gluten-free flours, such as rice flour or cornstarch, to create the same creamy and tangy flavor profile. Additionally, they ensure that all ingredients, including the oils and preservatives, are free from gluten contamination.</p>
