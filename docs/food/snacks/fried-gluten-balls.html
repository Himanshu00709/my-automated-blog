<h1>Fried Gluten Balls: A Delicious and Nutritious Delight</h1>

<p>Fried gluten balls, also known as "seitan balls" or "wheat meat balls," are a popular vegetarian and vegan alternative to traditional meatballs. Made from vital wheat gluten, these balls are packed with protein and have a chewy, meat-like texture that makes them a favorite among plant-based eaters. Whether you're a seasoned vegan or just looking to incorporate more plant-based meals into your diet, fried gluten balls are a versatile and satisfying option.</p>
