    <h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Bars: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free and dairy-free products has skyrocketed. Whether due to dietary restrictions, allergies, or personal health choices, more people are seeking out snacks that cater to these needs.

In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about these bars, from their benefits to how to choose the best ones for your lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten and Dairy-Free Bars?</h2>
    <p>Gluten and dairy-free bars are snack bars specifically formulated to exclude gluten (a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye) and dairy (products derived from milk). These bars are designed for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, lactose intolerance, or those who simply prefer to avoid these ingredients. They often feature alternative ingredients like nuts, seeds, fruits, and plant-based proteins to provide a satisfying and nutritious snack.</p>

        <li><strong>Lactose-Free:</strong> Dairy-free bars are ideal for those who are lactose intolerant or have a milk allergy, as they eliminate the risk of digestive upset or allergic reactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrient-Dense:</strong> Many gluten and dairy-free bars are packed with nutrients like fiber, protein, and healthy fats, making them a great option for a quick energy boost.</li>
