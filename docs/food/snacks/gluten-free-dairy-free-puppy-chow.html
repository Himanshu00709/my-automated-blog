    <h1>Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Puppy Chow: A Delicious and Allergy-Friendly Treat</h1>

    <p>Puppy chow, also known as muddy buddies, is a beloved snack that combines the crunch of cereal with the sweetness of chocolate and powdered sugar. Traditionally, this treat contains gluten and dairy, making it off-limits for those with dietary restrictions. However, with a few simple swaps, you can create a gluten-free and dairy-free version that’s just as delicious and satisfying. In this article, we’ll explore how to make this allergy-friendly treat, discuss its benefits, and answer some common questions about gluten-free and dairy-free puppy chow.</p>

    <h2>What is Puppy Chow?</h2>

    <p>Puppy chow is a no-bake snack made from cereal (usually Chex), coated in a mixture of melted chocolate, peanut butter, and butter, and then dusted with powdered sugar. It’s a popular treat for parties, movie nights, and holiday gatherings. However, the traditional recipe contains gluten (from the cereal) and dairy (from the butter and chocolate), which can be problematic for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or lactose intolerance.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free and Dairy-Free?</h2>

    <p>For many people, avoiding gluten and dairy is a necessity rather than a choice. Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, affects approximately 1% of the population. Additionally, many people experience non-celiac gluten sensitivity or lactose intolerance, which can cause digestive discomfort, bloating, and other symptoms. By creating a gluten-free and dairy-free version of puppy chow, you can enjoy this classic snack without compromising your health or dietary needs.</p>
