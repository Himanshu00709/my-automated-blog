    <h1>Gluten-Free Rice Crackers: A Healthy Snack Option</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of gluten intolerance and celiac disease. Among the many gluten-free snacks available, rice crackers have emerged as a popular choice. Not only are they delicious, but they also offer a range of health benefits.

Rice crackers are typically made by mixing rice flour with water, salt, and sometimes other flavorings, then baking or frying the mixture until it becomes crispy. The result is a light, crunchy snack that can be enjoyed on its own or paired with dips, cheeses, or spreads.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Rice Crackers</h2>
