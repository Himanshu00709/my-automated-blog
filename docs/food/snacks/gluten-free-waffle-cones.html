    <h1>Gluten-Free Waffle Cones: A Delicious and Inclusive Treat</h1>
    <p>Waffle cones are a beloved treat, often associated with summer days, ice cream shops, and sweet indulgences. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional waffle cones are off-limits due to their wheat-based ingredients. Enter gluten-free waffle cones—a delicious and inclusive alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this classic treat without compromising on taste or texture.

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Waffle Cones?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free waffle cones are a variation of the traditional waffle cone, made without any gluten-containing ingredients. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, which can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. By substituting wheat flour with gluten-free alternatives like rice flour, almond flour, or a gluten-free flour blend, these cones provide a safe and enjoyable option for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Waffle Cones</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free waffle cones offer several benefits, making them a popular choice for both gluten-sensitive individuals and those simply looking for a healthier alternative. Here are some key advantages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> They allow individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance to enjoy a classic treat without worry.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Gluten-free waffle cones can be paired with a variety of ice cream flavors, sorbets, or even fruit-based desserts.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutritional Options:</strong> Many gluten-free flours, such as almond or coconut flour, offer additional nutrients like protein and healthy fats.</li>
        <li><strong>Unique Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free flours can impart unique flavors and textures, adding a new dimension to the traditional waffle cone experience.</li>
