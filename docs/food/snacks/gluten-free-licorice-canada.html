    <h1>Gluten-Free Licorice in Canada: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Licorice has been a beloved treat for centuries, known for its unique flavor and chewy texture. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding gluten-free licorice can be a challenge. In Canada, the demand for gluten-free products has grown significantly, and licorice is no exception. This guide will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free licorice in Canada, from its benefits to where you can find it.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Licorice?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free licorice is a type of licorice that does not contain gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Traditional licorice often contains wheat flour as a binding agent, which makes it unsuitable for those with gluten sensitivities. Gluten-free licorice, on the other hand, uses alternative ingredients like rice flour or potato starch to achieve the same chewy texture without the gluten.</p>

        <li><strong>Digestive Health:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe digestive issues. Gluten-free licorice eliminates this risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Wider Availability:</strong> With the growing demand for gluten-free products, more brands are offering gluten-free licorice, making it easier to find in Canada.</li>
