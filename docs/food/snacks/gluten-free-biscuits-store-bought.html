<h1>Gluten-Free Biscuits: A Comprehensive Guide to Store-Bought Options</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and biscuits are no exception. Whether you're managing celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply opting for a gluten-free lifestyle, finding the right store-bought gluten-free biscuits can be a game-changer. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about gluten-free biscuits, from what to look for on the label to the best brands available in stores.</p>

<h2>What Are Gluten-Free Biscuits?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free biscuits are baked goods made without gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. These biscuits are designed to cater to individuals who need to avoid gluten for health reasons or personal preferences. They are typically made with alternative flours such as almond flour, rice flour, or tapioca flour, which provide a similar texture and taste to traditional biscuits.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Biscuits?</h2>

<p>There are several reasons why someone might choose gluten-free biscuits:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Celiac Disease:</strong> A serious autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine.</li>
    <li><strong>Gluten Sensitivity:</strong> A condition where individuals experience symptoms similar to celiac disease but without the intestinal damage.</li>
    <li><strong>Wheat Allergy:</strong> An allergic reaction to proteins found in wheat, which can cause symptoms ranging from mild to severe.</li>
    <li><strong>Dietary Preference:</strong> Some people choose gluten-free products as part of a healthier lifestyle or to reduce inflammation.</li>
</ul>
