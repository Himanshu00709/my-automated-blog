<h1>Gluten-Free Store-Bought Snacks: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders such as celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergies. For those who must avoid gluten, finding safe and delicious snacks can be a challenge.

Choosing gluten-free snacks ensures that these individuals can enjoy their food without the risk of adverse health effects.</p>

<p>Moreover, gluten-free snacks are often made with whole, nutrient-dense ingredients, making them a healthier option for everyone. Many gluten-free snacks are also free from artificial additives and preservatives, which can be beneficial for overall health.</p>
