    <h1>Walker's Gluten-Free Shortbread Cookies: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Walker's Gluten-Free Shortbread Cookies have become a beloved treat for those who follow a gluten-free diet, as well as for anyone who appreciates the rich, buttery flavor of traditional shortbread. These cookies are a testament to Walker's commitment to quality and tradition, offering a gluten-free option that doesn't compromise on taste or texture. In this blog post, we'll explore the history of Walker's shortbread, the ingredients that make their gluten-free cookies so special, and why they are a must-try for anyone looking for a delicious, gluten-free snack.</p>

    <h2>The History of Walker's Shortbread</h2>

    <p>Walker's Shortbread has a long and storied history that dates back to 1898 when Joseph Walker opened his bakery in the small Scottish village of Aberlour.

Over the years, Walker's Shortbread has grown into a globally recognized brand, but the company has remained true to its roots, continuing to use the same simple recipe that Joseph Walker perfected over a century ago.</p>

    <p>In recent years, Walker's has expanded its product line to include gluten-free options, recognizing the growing demand for gluten-free products.
