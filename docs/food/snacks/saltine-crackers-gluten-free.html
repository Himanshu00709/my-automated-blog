    <h1>Gluten-Free Saltine Crackers: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Saltine crackers have long been a staple in pantries around the world. Known for their crisp texture and versatility, they are often used as a snack, a base for appetizers, or even as a remedy for an upset stomach. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, traditional saltine crackers are off the menu due to their gluten content. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free diets has led to the development of gluten-free saltine crackers, offering a safe and delicious alternative for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Saltine Crackers?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free saltine crackers are a variation of the classic saltine cracker, made without any gluten-containing ingredients. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause severe health issues for people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Gluten-free saltine crackers are typically made from alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour, which provide a similar texture and taste without the harmful effects of gluten.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Saltine Crackers</h2>

    <p>Switching to gluten-free saltine crackers can offer several benefits, especially for those with gluten-related health issues. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>
