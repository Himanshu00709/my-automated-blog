These iconic snacks, with their soft sponge cake, creamy filling, and festive green icing, have been a staple of holiday celebrations for decades. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying these treats has often been off the table—until now. Enter gluten-free Little Debbie Christmas Tree Cakes, a game-changer for holiday snacking.</p>
