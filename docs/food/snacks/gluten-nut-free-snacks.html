    <h1>Gluten-Free and Nut-Free Snacks: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In today’s health-conscious world, dietary restrictions such as gluten intolerance and nut allergies are becoming increasingly common. For individuals navigating these dietary challenges, finding safe and delicious snacks can be a daunting task. This guide aims to provide a detailed overview of gluten-free and nut-free snacks, offering practical tips, product recommendations, and recipes to help you enjoy snacking without worry.</p>

For those with these conditions, avoiding cross-contamination and carefully reading labels is essential.</p>

        <li><strong>Allergy Management:</strong> Nut-free snacks eliminate the risk of allergic reactions, making them safe for individuals with nut allergies.</li>
