    <h1>Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Snacks: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free and dairy-free snacks has skyrocketed. Whether due to dietary restrictions, allergies, or personal health choices, more people are seeking out snacks that cater to these needs. Fortunately, the market has responded with a wide array of delicious and nutritious options. In this guide, we’ll explore some of the best gluten-free and dairy-free snacks available, along with tips for making informed choices.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free and Dairy-Free Snacks?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free and dairy-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or lactose intolerance. However, even those without these conditions may choose these diets for their potential health benefits. Gluten-free snacks are free from wheat, barley, and rye, which can cause digestive issues for some people. Dairy-free snacks, on the other hand, exclude milk and milk products, which can be problematic for those with lactose intolerance or a milk allergy. Together, these snacks offer a safe and enjoyable way to satisfy cravings without compromising health.</p>
