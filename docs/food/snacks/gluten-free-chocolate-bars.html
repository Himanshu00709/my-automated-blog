    <h1>Gluten-Free Chocolate Bars: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Chocolate is one of the most beloved treats worldwide, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a safe and delicious option can be a challenge.

    <h2>What Makes a Chocolate Bar Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For a chocolate bar to be considered gluten-free, it must not contain any of these ingredients or be processed in a facility that handles gluten-containing products. Many chocolate bars are naturally gluten-free, but cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing. Therefore, it’s essential to look for products that are certified gluten-free.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Safe for Celiac Patients:</strong> Gluten-free chocolate bars are safe for individuals with celiac disease, as they do not contain gluten proteins that can trigger an immune response.</li>
        <li><strong>Digestive Health:</strong> For those with gluten sensitivities, consuming gluten-free products can help improve digestive health and reduce symptoms like bloating and discomfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Wider Variety:</strong> The gluten-free market has expanded significantly, offering a wide range of flavors and types of chocolate bars to choose from.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthier Options:</strong> Many gluten-free chocolate bars are made with high-quality ingredients, such as dark chocolate, which is rich in antioxidants.</li>
