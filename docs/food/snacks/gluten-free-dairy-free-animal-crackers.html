    <h1>Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Animal Crackers: A Delicious and Healthy Snack Option</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free and dairy-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of food intolerances, allergies, and dietary preferences. Among the many snack options available, gluten-free dairy-free animal crackers have emerged as a popular choice for both children and adults. These delightful treats not only cater to specific dietary needs but also offer a nostalgic taste that reminds us of childhood.

        <li><strong>Digestive Health:</strong> For individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, consuming gluten-free products can help prevent digestive issues such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea.</li>
        <li><strong>Allergy-Friendly:</strong> By avoiding dairy, these crackers are safe for those with lactose intolerance or milk allergies.</li>
