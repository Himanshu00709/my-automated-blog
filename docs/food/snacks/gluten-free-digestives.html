    <h1>Gluten-Free Digestives: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by an increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders and a growing preference for healthier dietary choices. Among the many gluten-free options available, gluten-free digestives have gained significant popularity. These biscuits, traditionally made with wheat flour, have been reimagined to cater to those who need or choose to avoid gluten. This article delves into the world of gluten-free digestives, exploring their benefits, ingredients, and how they compare to their traditional counterparts.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Digestives?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free digestives are a type of biscuit that is made without gluten-containing ingredients. Traditional digestives are typically made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, gluten-free versions use alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or oat flour (provided the oats are certified gluten-free). These biscuits are designed to be easier on the digestive system for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Digestives</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free digestives offer several benefits, particularly for individuals with gluten-related disorders. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Digestive Health:</strong> For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe digestive issues. Gluten-free digestives help avoid these problems, promoting better gut health.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich Ingredients:</strong> Many gluten-free digestives are made with nutrient-dense flours like almond or coconut flour, which provide additional vitamins and minerals compared to traditional wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Gluten-free digestives can be enjoyed by anyone, not just those with gluten intolerance. They are a great option for anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake or explore new dietary options.</li>
    </ul>
