    <h1>Walkers Shortbread Cookies Gluten-Free: A Delicious Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Walkers Shortbread Cookies have long been a beloved treat for those who appreciate the rich, buttery flavor of traditional Scottish shortbread. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying these cookies has often been off the table—until now. Walkers has introduced a gluten-free version of their iconic shortbread cookies, allowing everyone to indulge in this classic treat without worry. In this article, we’ll explore the history of Walkers Shortbread, the ingredients and process behind their gluten-free cookies, and why they’re a must-try for anyone seeking a delicious, gluten-free snack.</p>

    <h2>The History of Walkers Shortbread</h2>
    <p>Walkers Shortbread has been a household name since 1898, when Joseph Walker began baking shortbread in his small kitchen in the Scottish Highlands. Over the years, the company has grown into a global brand, known for its commitment to quality and tradition. Walkers Shortbread is made using a simple recipe that includes only four ingredients: flour, butter, sugar, and salt. This simplicity is what gives the cookies their signature rich, buttery flavor and crumbly texture.</p>

    <p>Despite their traditional roots, Walkers has always been forward-thinking when it comes to meeting the needs of their customers. Recognizing the growing demand for gluten-free products, the company has expanded its offerings to include a gluten-free version of their famous shortbread cookies. This move has been welcomed by gluten-sensitive individuals and celiac sufferers alike, who can now enjoy the same high-quality shortbread that Walkers is known for.</p>

Instead of using wheat flour, Walkers uses a blend of gluten-free flours to achieve the same delicious taste and texture. The result is a cookie that is just as rich and buttery as the original, but safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>
