    <h1>Sour Cream and Onion Chips: A Gluten-Free Snack Guide</h1>
    <p>When it comes to snacking, sour cream and onion chips are a classic favorite. Their tangy, savory flavor has won over countless taste buds. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a safe and delicious option can be a challenge. In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free sour cream and onion chips, including popular brands, nutritional insights, and tips for making your own at home.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Sour Cream and Onion Chips Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For chips to be gluten-free, they must avoid these ingredients entirely. Many sour cream and onion chips are naturally gluten-free because they are made from potatoes or corn, which do not contain gluten. However, cross-contamination during manufacturing or the use of gluten-containing flavorings can pose a risk. Always check the packaging for a certified gluten-free label to ensure safety.</p>

    <h2>Popular Gluten-Free Sour Cream and Onion Chip Brands</h2>
    <p>Several brands offer gluten-free sour cream and onion chips. Here’s a table of some popular options:</p>

                <th>Nutrient</th>
                <th>Amount</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Calories</td>
                <td>150</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Total Fat</td>

                <td>180mg</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Carbohydrates</td>
                <td>15g</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>2g</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
