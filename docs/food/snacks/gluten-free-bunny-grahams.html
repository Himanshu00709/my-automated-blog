    <h2>How Do Gluten-Free Bunny Grahams Compare to Traditional Graham Crackers?</h2>

    <p>When it comes to taste and texture, Gluten-Free Bunny Grahams are quite similar to traditional graham crackers.

        <li><strong>Nutritional Profile:</strong> While both types of graham crackers are relatively low in calories and fat, Gluten-Free Bunny Grahams may have a slightly different nutritional profile due to the use of alternative flours and sweeteners.</li>
    </ul>
