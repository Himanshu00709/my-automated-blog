    <p>Moreover, gluten-free mozzarella sticks are often made with high-quality ingredients, such as almond flour, rice flour, or gluten-free breadcrumbs, which can add a unique flavor and texture to the dish. These alternatives are not only gluten-free but also packed with nutrients, making them a more wholesome choice.</p>

    </table>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow bowl, whisk the eggs until well beaten. In another bowl, combine the gluten-free breadcrumbs, almond flour, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Dip each mozzarella stick into the beaten eggs, ensuring it is fully coated. Then, roll the stick in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to adhere the coating.</li>
        <li>Place the coated mozzarella sticks on a baking sheet and freeze for at least 30 minutes. This step is crucial to prevent the cheese from melting too quickly during frying.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a deep skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the mozzarella sticks in batches, frying until golden brown on all sides, about 2-3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Remove the mozzarella sticks from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
