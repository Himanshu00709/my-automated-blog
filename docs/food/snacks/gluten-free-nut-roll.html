    <h1>Gluten-Free Nut Roll: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular over the years, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply a desire for healthier eating habits. One of the challenges of maintaining a gluten-free diet is finding delicious and satisfying alternatives to traditional baked goods. Enter the gluten-free nut roll—a delightful treat that combines the rich flavors of nuts, sweet fillings, and a tender, gluten-free dough. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free nut rolls, from their history to how you can make them at home.</p>

    <h2>What is a Gluten-Free Nut Roll?</h2>
    <p>A gluten-free nut roll is a variation of the traditional nut roll, a popular pastry in Central and Eastern European cuisines. The classic nut roll consists of a sweet yeast dough filled with a mixture of ground nuts, sugar, and spices, then rolled into a log shape and baked. The gluten-free version replaces traditional wheat flour with gluten-free alternatives, such as almond flour, rice flour, or a gluten-free flour blend, making it suitable for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>The History of Nut Rolls</h2>
    <p>Nut rolls have a rich history, particularly in countries like Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Croatia, where they are often served during holidays and special occasions. Known by various names such as "potica" in Slovenia or "bejgli" in Hungary, these pastries have been a staple in European households for centuries. The gluten-free adaptation of nut rolls is a more recent development, reflecting the growing demand for gluten-free options in modern cuisine.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for a Gluten-Free Nut Roll</h2>

    <h2>How to Make a Gluten-Free Nut Roll</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free nut roll may seem daunting, but with the right steps, it’s entirely achievable. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating this delicious treat:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by combining your gluten-free flour blend with xanthan gum, sugar, and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together warm milk, melted butter, and eggs. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms. Knead the dough gently until it becomes smooth and elastic.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Nut Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough rests, prepare the nut filling. Combine ground nuts, sugar, cinnamon, and a touch of melted butter in a bowl. Mix until the ingredients are well combined and the mixture is slightly sticky.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble and Roll</h3>
    <p>Roll out the dough into a rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Spread the nut filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Carefully roll the dough into a log shape, starting from one of the longer sides. Seal the edges by pinching the dough together.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the rolled dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the top with an egg wash for a golden finish. Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 25-30 minutes, or until the roll is golden brown and cooked through.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Nut Rolls</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend for the best texture.</li>
        <li>Allow the dough to rest before rolling to make it easier to handle.</li>
        <li>Don’t overfill the dough, as this can cause the roll to burst during baking.</li>
        <li>Let the nut roll cool completely before slicing to ensure clean cuts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Nut Rolls</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use different nuts for the filling?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While walnuts are traditional, you can use pecans, almonds, or even a mix of your favorite nuts.</p>

        <h3>How do I store gluten-free nut rolls?</h3>
        <p>Store the nut roll in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or refrigerate for up to a week. You can also freeze it for longer storage.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with coconut oil and use a flax egg instead of regular eggs. For the milk, opt for a plant-based alternative like almond or oat milk.</p>
