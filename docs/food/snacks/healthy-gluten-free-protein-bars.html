    <p>Moreover, gluten-free protein bars are often made with whole, natural ingredients, making them a healthier alternative to traditional protein bars that may contain artificial additives and preservatives. They are also a great way to support muscle recovery, maintain energy levels, and curb hunger between meals.</p>

            <tr>
                <td><strong>Natural Sweeteners</strong></td>
                <td>Look for bars sweetened with natural options like honey, maple syrup, or dates. These provide a healthier alternative to refined sugars and help maintain stable blood sugar levels.</td>

            <tr>
                <td><strong>Superfoods</strong></td>
