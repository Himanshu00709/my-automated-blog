<h2>How is Gluten-Free String Cheese Made?</h2>

<p>The process of making gluten-free string cheese is similar to that of traditional string cheese. It starts with high-quality milk, which is pasteurized and then cultured with specific bacteria to develop flavor. The milk is then coagulated using rennet, an enzyme that helps separate the curds from the whey. The curds are heated and stretched, giving the cheese its characteristic stringy texture. Finally, the cheese is shaped into individual sticks and packaged. To ensure the product is gluten-free, manufacturers must avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing ingredients during processing.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Right Gluten-Free String Cheese</h2>

<p>When selecting gluten-free string cheese, it's important to read the label carefully. Look for products that are certified gluten-free by a reputable organization. Additionally, consider the following factors:</p>

    <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Ensure that the cheese contains no gluten-containing additives or flavorings.</li>
    <li><strong>Brand Reputation:</strong> Choose brands that are known for their commitment to gluten-free products and have a good track record of quality and safety.</li>
    <li><strong>Nutritional Content:</strong> Check the nutritional information to ensure the cheese meets your dietary needs, especially if you're following a specific diet like keto or low-carb.</li>
