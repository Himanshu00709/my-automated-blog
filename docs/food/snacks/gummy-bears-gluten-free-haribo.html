    <h1>Are Haribo Gummy Bears Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>
    <p>Gummy bears are a beloved treat for people of all ages, and Haribo is one of the most iconic brands in the world. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Haribo gummy bears are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to determine if Haribo gummy bears are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Haribo Gummy Bears Made Of?</h2>
    <p>Haribo gummy bears are made from a combination of ingredients that give them their signature chewy texture and fruity flavors. The primary ingredients include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Glucose syrup</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Gelatin</li>
        <li>Citric acid</li>
        <li>Natural and artificial flavors</li>
        <li>Fruit and plant concentrates for color</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, the devil is in the details, and cross-contamination during manufacturing can be a concern for those with severe gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>Are Haribo Gummy Bears Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>According to Haribo’s official statements, their classic gummy bears are gluten-free. The company has confirmed that the ingredients used in their gummy bears do not contain gluten, and they have processes in place to minimize the risk of cross-contamination. However, it’s important to note that Haribo does not certify their gummy bears as gluten-free through third-party organizations like the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO).</p>
