<h1>Gluten-Free Mini Pretzels: A Delicious and Healthy Snack Option</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of gluten intolerance and celiac disease. Among the many gluten-free snacks available, gluten-free mini pretzels have emerged as a popular choice for those seeking a tasty and convenient snack. These bite-sized treats offer the same satisfying crunch and flavor as traditional pretzels but without the gluten, making them a perfect option for anyone following a gluten-free diet.</p>

They are a versatile snack that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, whether as a quick bite between meals or as part of a larger snack platter.</p>
