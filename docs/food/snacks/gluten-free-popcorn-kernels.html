    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Popcorn Kernels?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free popcorn kernels are simply popcorn kernels that have not been contaminated with gluten during processing. Popcorn itself is naturally gluten-free, as it is made from whole grain corn. However, cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing, packaging, or even in your own kitchen if you use shared equipment. Therefore, it's essential to choose popcorn kernels that are certified gluten-free if you have a gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>

    <p>When shopping for gluten-free popcorn kernels, look for labels that indicate the product is certified gluten-free. This certification ensures that the popcorn has been tested and meets strict gluten-free standards, typically containing less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</p>

    <h2>How to Prepare Gluten-Free Popcorn Kernels</h2>

    <p>Preparing gluten-free popcorn kernels at home is easy and allows you to control the ingredients, ensuring your snack remains gluten-free. Here are a few methods you can use to make delicious gluten-free popcorn:</p>

    <h3>1. Air-Popping</h3>

    <p>Air-popping is one of the healthiest ways to prepare popcorn. Simply place the gluten-free popcorn kernels in an air popper, and let the machine do the work. The result is light, fluffy popcorn without any added oils or fats. You can season your popcorn with a sprinkle of salt, nutritional yeast, or your favorite gluten-free spices.</p>

    <h3>2. Stovetop Popping</h3>

    <p>Stovetop popping is another popular method. Heat a small amount of oil (such as coconut or olive oil) in a large pot over medium heat. Add a few popcorn kernels and wait for them to pop. Once they pop, add the rest of the kernels, cover the pot, and shake it occasionally to prevent burning. Once the popping slows down, remove the pot from the heat and season your popcorn as desired.</p>

    <h3>3. Microwave Popping</h3>

    <p>If you prefer convenience, you can also pop gluten-free popcorn kernels in the microwave. Place the kernels in a microwave-safe bowl, cover with a microwave-safe plate, and microwave on high for 2-4 minutes, or until the popping slows down. Be sure to use a bowl that allows steam to escape to prevent the popcorn from becoming soggy.</p>
