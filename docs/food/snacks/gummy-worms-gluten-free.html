    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Gummy Worms?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free gummy worms are a type of candy that does not contain gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. These gummy worms are made with alternative ingredients that ensure they are safe for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease.

    <h2>Ingredients in Gluten-Free Gummy Worms</h2>

    <p>The ingredients in gluten-free gummy worms can vary depending on the brand, but they typically include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gelatin:</strong> A protein derived from animal collagen, which gives gummy worms their chewy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Provides sweetness and helps to preserve the candy.</li>
        <li><strong>Corn Syrup:</strong> Adds moisture and prevents the gummies from drying out.</li>
        <li><strong>Natural and Artificial Flavors:</strong> Used to create the fruity tastes that gummy worms are known for.</li>
        <li><strong>Food Coloring:</strong> Adds vibrant colors to the gummy worms.</li>
        <li><strong>Citric Acid:</strong> Provides a tangy flavor and acts as a preservative.</li>
    </ul>
