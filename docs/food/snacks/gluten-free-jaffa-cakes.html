    <h1>Gluten-Free Jaffa Cakes: A Delicious and Inclusive Treat</h1>

    <p>Jaffa Cakes are a beloved British snack, known for their unique combination of sponge cake, tangy orange jelly, and a layer of rich chocolate. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying traditional Jaffa Cakes can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free Jaffa Cakes—a delightful alternative that allows everyone to indulge in this classic treat without compromising on taste or texture. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free Jaffa Cakes, from their ingredients and preparation to their nutritional benefits and where to find them.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Jaffa Cakes?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free Jaffa Cakes are a variation of the traditional Jaffa Cake, designed to be free from gluten-containing ingredients. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, which can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. By substituting wheat flour with gluten-free alternatives like rice flour, almond flour, or a gluten-free flour blend, these cakes retain the same delicious taste and texture while being safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <p>The key components of a gluten-free Jaffa Cake include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sponge Base:</strong> Made with gluten-free flour, eggs, sugar, and a raising agent like baking powder.</li>
        <li><strong>Orange Jelly:</strong> A tangy, fruity layer made from orange juice, sugar, and gelatin or a vegan alternative like agar-agar.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate Topping:</strong> A smooth layer of dark, milk, or white chocolate that complements the orange jelly perfectly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Jaffa Cakes?</h2>
