    <h1>Gluten-Free Nutter Butter: A Delicious and Allergy-Friendly Treat</h1>
    <p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a satisfying snack that doesn't compromise on taste can be a challenge.

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Nutter Butter?</h2>

Additionally, gluten-free Nutter Butter cookies often contain fewer preservatives and artificial ingredients, making them a cleaner option for snacking.</p>
