<h1>Hydrox Cookies: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

<p>Hydrox cookies have been a beloved treat for over a century, known for their iconic chocolate sandwich cookies with a creamy filling. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, many have wondered if Hydrox cookies can be enjoyed without the worry of gluten. In this article, we’ll explore the world of Hydrox cookies, their gluten-free options, and why they remain a favorite for cookie enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>The History of Hydrox Cookies</h2>

<p>Hydrox cookies were first introduced in 1908 by the Sunshine Biscuits company, predating the more famous Oreo by four years. These cookies quickly became a staple in American households, known for their crisp texture and rich chocolate flavor.

However, Hydrox has maintained a loyal fan base, and in recent years, they’ve made a comeback, especially among those seeking gluten-free options.</p>

<h2>Are Hydrox Cookies Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Traditionally, Hydrox cookies were not gluten-free, as they were made with wheat flour. However, in response to the growing demand for gluten-free products, the brand has introduced gluten-free versions of their classic cookies. These gluten-free Hydrox cookies are made with alternative flours, such as rice flour or almond flour, to ensure they are safe for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that not all Hydrox cookies are gluten-free, so it’s essential to check the packaging for the gluten-free label. The gluten-free versions are often clearly marked, making it easy for consumers to identify them.</p>
