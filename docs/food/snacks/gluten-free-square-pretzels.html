    <h1>Gluten-Free Square Pretzels: A Delicious and Healthy Snack Option</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders and the growing popularity of gluten-free diets. Among the many gluten-free snacks available, gluten-free square pretzels have emerged as a favorite for many. These crunchy, savory treats offer the same satisfying taste and texture as traditional pretzels but without the gluten, making them a perfect snack for those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Square Pretzels?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free square pretzels are a variation of the classic pretzel snack, made without any gluten-containing ingredients. Traditional pretzels are typically made from wheat flour, which contains gluten, a protein that can cause adverse reactions in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Gluten-free square pretzels, on the other hand, are made using alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour, which do not contain gluten. These pretzels are often shaped into squares for a unique twist on the traditional pretzel knot.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Square Pretzels?</h2>

    <p>There are several reasons why gluten-free square pretzels have become a popular snack choice:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and skin problems. Gluten-free square pretzels provide a safe and delicious alternative that allows these individuals to enjoy a classic snack without the negative health effects.</li>
        <li><strong>Dietary Flexibility:</strong> Even for those without gluten-related disorders, gluten-free square pretzels can be a great addition to a balanced diet. They are often lower in calories and fat compared to traditional pretzels, making them a healthier snack option.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Gluten-free square pretzels can be enjoyed on their own or paired with dips, spreads, or toppings. They can also be used in recipes, such as gluten-free pretzel crusts for desserts or as a crunchy topping for salads.</li>
