        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>

        <li>Add the Greek yogurt to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms. The dough should be slightly sticky but manageable.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a ball. Use your thumb to create a hole in the center of each ball, forming the classic bagel shape.</li>
        <li>Place the shaped bagels onto the prepared baking sheet. In a small bowl, beat the egg and brush it over the top of each bagel. This will give them a golden, shiny finish.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle your desired toppings (e.g., sesame seeds, poppy seeds) over the bagels.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the bagels are golden brown and firm to the touch.</li>
        <li>Allow the bagels to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy them plain, toasted, or with your favorite spreads!</li>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular yogurt instead of Greek yogurt?</h3>

        <h3>2. What type of gluten-free flour works best?</h3>

        <h3>4. Are these bagels suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe contains Greek yogurt and egg, so it is not vegan. However, you can experiment with plant-based yogurt and an egg substitute like flaxseed meal to make a vegan version.</p>
