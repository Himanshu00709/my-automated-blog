<p>These cookies come in a variety of flavors and types, including chocolate chip, oatmeal, sugar cookies, and more. They are typically sold in rolls or pre-portioned dough balls, making them easy to bake at home. The convenience of having ready-to-bake cookie dough in your fridge means you can enjoy fresh, warm cookies anytime without the hassle of preparing the dough from scratch.</p>
