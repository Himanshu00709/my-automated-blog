    <h1>Gluten-Free Peeps: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular over the years, not just for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also for individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle. Among the many gluten-free products available, gluten-free Peeps have emerged as a favorite for those with dietary restrictions. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free Peeps, from their ingredients to their availability, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Peeps?</h2>

    <p>Peeps are a popular marshmallow candy that has been a staple in American households for decades, especially during holidays like Easter. Traditionally, Peeps are made from sugar, corn syrup, gelatin, and various food colorings. However, for those who need to avoid gluten, the standard Peeps recipe can be problematic due to potential cross-contamination or the use of gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free Peeps are specially formulated to ensure that they do not contain any gluten or are produced in a facility that avoids cross-contamination. This makes them safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity to enjoy without worry.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Gluten-Free Peeps</h2>

    <p>The ingredients in gluten-free Peeps are similar to those in traditional Peeps, but with careful attention to avoid gluten-containing substances. Here’s a breakdown of the typical ingredients found in gluten-free Peeps:</p>

                <td>Adds moisture and prevents crystallization</td>
            </tr>

                <td>Gelatin</td>
                <td>Gives the marshmallow its chewy texture</td>
