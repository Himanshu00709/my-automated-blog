    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free dairy-free mozzarella sticks:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cheese</h3>
    <p>Cut the dairy-free mozzarella cheese into sticks, about 1/2 inch thick and 3 inches long. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and freeze for at least 30 minutes. Freezing the cheese helps it hold its shape during the frying process.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Set Up Your Breading Station</h3>
    <p>In three separate bowls, prepare your breading station. In the first bowl, place the gluten-free flour. In the second bowl, whisk together the unsweetened almond milk and egg replacer. In the third bowl, mix the gluten-free breadcrumbs with garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bread the Cheese Sticks</h3>
    <p>Take the frozen cheese sticks and coat them first in the gluten-free flour, then dip them into the almond milk mixture, and finally coat them with the breadcrumb mixture. Make sure each stick is evenly coated. For extra crispiness, you can repeat the dipping process.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Fry the Mozzarella Sticks</h3>
    <p>Heat the oil in a deep fryer or a heavy-bottomed pot to 375°F (190°C). Carefully place the breaded cheese sticks into the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. Be sure not to overcrowd the pot to maintain the oil temperature.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Drain and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the mozzarella sticks are golden brown, remove them from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauce, such as marinara or dairy-free ranch.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I bake these mozzarella sticks instead of frying them?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake them! Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and place the breaded cheese sticks on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 10-12 minutes, flipping halfway through, until they are golden brown and crispy.</p>

        <h3>What are the best dairy-free cheeses for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Some of the best dairy-free cheeses for mozzarella sticks include Daiya, Violife, and Follow Your Heart. These brands melt well and have a texture similar to traditional mozzarella.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these mozzarella sticks ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the breaded cheese sticks ahead of time and freeze them. When you’re ready to cook, simply fry or bake them directly from the freezer, adding a few extra minutes to the cooking time if necessary.</p>

        <h3>Are gluten-free breadcrumbs necessary?</h3>
        <p>If you’re following a strict gluten-free diet, it’s essential to use gluten-free breadcrumbs. Regular breadcrumbs contain gluten, which can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free dairy-free mozzarella sticks are a fantastic alternative for anyone with dietary restrictions or those simply looking for a healthier snack option. With the right ingredients and a little bit of preparation, you can enjoy these crispy, gooey treats without compromising on taste or texture. Whether you fry or bake them, these mozzarella sticks are sure to be a hit at your next gathering or as a quick snack at home. So, why not give them a try? Your taste buds will thank you!</p>
