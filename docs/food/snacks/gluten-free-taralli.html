    <h1>Gluten-Free Taralli: A Delicious and Healthy Snack</h1>

    <p>Taralli, a traditional Italian snack, has been enjoyed for centuries. These small, ring-shaped biscuits are typically made with wheat flour, olive oil, and white wine, and are often flavored with fennel, pepper, or other spices. However, with the rise of gluten intolerance and celiac disease, gluten-free taralli have become increasingly popular. In this article, we will explore the world of gluten-free taralli, their benefits, and how you can enjoy them as part of a healthy diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Taralli?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free taralli are often made with the same basic ingredients as traditional taralli, including olive oil, white wine, and various seasonings. The key difference lies in the flour used, which must be certified gluten-free to ensure it is safe for consumption by those with gluten-related disorders.</p>
