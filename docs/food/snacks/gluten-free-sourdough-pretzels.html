    <h1>Gluten-Free Sourdough Pretzels: A Delicious Twist on a Classic</h1>

    <p>Pretzels have long been a beloved snack, with their chewy texture and distinctive shape making them a favorite for many. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, traditional pretzels are off the menu. Enter gluten-free sourdough pretzels—a delicious and nutritious alternative that combines the tangy flavor of sourdough with the satisfying chewiness of a pretzel. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free sourdough pretzels, from their health benefits to how you can make them at home.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Sourdough Pretzels?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free sourdough pretzels are a variation of the classic pretzel, made without wheat or other gluten-containing grains. Instead, they are crafted using gluten-free flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or a blend of gluten-free flours. The sourdough aspect comes from the use of a gluten-free sourdough starter, which ferments the dough and gives it a unique tangy flavor. This fermentation process also makes the pretzels easier to digest and can enhance their nutritional profile.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Sourdough Pretzels</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free sourdough pretzels offer several health benefits, especially for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>

    <p>Making gluten-free sourdough pretzels at home is a rewarding process that allows you to control the ingredients and customize the flavor. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup gluten-free sourdough starter</li>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup baking soda (for boiling)</li>
        <li>Coarse salt for topping</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free sourdough starter, gluten-free flour blend, salt, sugar, warm water, and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>First Rise:</strong> Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise for 4-6 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Pretzels:</strong> Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a long rope and twist into a pretzel shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Boil the Pretzels:</strong> Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the baking soda. Boil each pretzel for 30 seconds, then remove and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Sprinkle the pretzels with coarse salt and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the pretzels to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy with your favorite dips or spreads!</li>
