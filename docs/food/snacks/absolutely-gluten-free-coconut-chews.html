    <h1>Absolutely Gluten-Free Coconut Chews: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the desire for healthier eating habits. Among the many gluten-free options available, coconut chews have emerged as a popular choice for those seeking a sweet yet nutritious snack. These chewy, flavorful treats are not only gluten-free but also packed with natural ingredients that offer a host of health benefits. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about absolutely gluten-free coconut chews, from their ingredients and nutritional value to how you can make them at home.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Coconut Chews?</h2>
