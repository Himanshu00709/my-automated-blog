<h1>Lemonheads Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Lemonheads, the iconic tangy and sweet candy, have been a favorite treat for generations. Known for their bold lemon flavor and satisfying crunch, Lemonheads have become a staple in candy aisles worldwide. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Are Lemonheads gluten-free? In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about Lemonheads and their gluten-free status, including ingredients, manufacturing processes, and more.</p>

<h2>What Are Lemonheads?</h2>

<p>Lemonheads are small, round, lemon-flavored candies that have been delighting taste buds since their introduction in 1962.

The candy is coated with a sugary shell that gives it a satisfying crunch, followed by a chewy center. Over the years, Lemonheads have expanded their product line to include other flavors, such as Cherryheads and Appleheads, but the classic Lemonheads remain the most popular.</p>

<h2>Are Lemonheads Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Yes, Lemonheads are gluten-free. According to the manufacturer, Ferrara Candy Company, Lemonheads do not contain any gluten ingredients. This makes them a safe option for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it’s always important to check the packaging for any potential cross-contamination warnings, as manufacturing processes can vary.</p>
