    <h1>Caramel Candy: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

    <p>Caramel candy has long been a favorite treat for many, offering a perfect blend of sweetness and chewiness. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding gluten-free caramel candy can be a challenge. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free caramel candy, its benefits, and how to ensure you’re choosing the right products. Whether you’re a caramel lover or someone looking for safe, gluten-free options, this guide is for you.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Caramel Candy Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Caramel candy is traditionally made from sugar, butter, and cream, which are naturally gluten-free ingredients. However, the gluten-free status of caramel candy can be compromised during the manufacturing process. Cross-contamination with gluten-containing products or the addition of flavorings and additives that contain gluten can make caramel candy unsafe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <p>To ensure that caramel candy is gluten-free, it’s essential to look for products that are certified gluten-free. These products have been tested and verified to contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Caramel Candy</h2>

    <p>Choosing gluten-free caramel candy offers several benefits, especially for those with gluten-related health issues. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>
