    <h2>How to Choose the Right Gluten-Free Cracker for Your Cheese</h2>

    <p>When selecting a gluten-free cracker to pair with cheese, consider the following factors:</p>

    <ul>

        <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> The cracker's flavor should complement, not overpower, the cheese. Neutral-flavored crackers are versatile, while those with herbs or seeds can add an extra dimension to the pairing.</li>
        <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Look for crackers made with high-quality, whole-food ingredients. Avoid those with excessive additives or preservatives.</li>
    </ul>
