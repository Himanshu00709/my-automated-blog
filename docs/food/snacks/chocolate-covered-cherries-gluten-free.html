    <h2>What Makes Chocolate Covered Cherries Gluten-Free?</h2>

        <li><strong>Chocolate:</strong> Pure chocolate made from cocoa beans, sugar, and cocoa butter is gluten-free. However, some chocolate products may contain additives or flavorings that include gluten, so it’s essential to check the label.</li>
        <li><strong>Filling:</strong> The creamy filling in chocolate-covered cherries is typically made from sugar, corn syrup, and other flavorings, which are also gluten-free.</li>
