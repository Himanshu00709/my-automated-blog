    <h1>Are Fruit Gushers Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Fruit Gushers, the beloved chewy fruit snacks with a liquid center, have been a favorite among kids and adults alike for decades. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether these tasty treats are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to determine if Fruit Gushers are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Fruit Gushers?</h2>
    <p>Fruit Gushers are a type of fruit snack produced by General Mills under the Betty Crocker brand. They are known for their unique texture—a chewy outer layer that bursts with a liquid fruit filling when bitten into. Available in a variety of flavors, Fruit Gushers are a popular choice for lunchboxes, snacks, and even dessert alternatives.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe autoimmune reactions. As a result, many people must adhere to a strict gluten-free diet to maintain their health.</p>

    <h2>Are Fruit Gushers Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>To determine whether Fruit Gushers are gluten-free, we need to examine their ingredients and manufacturing processes. According to the product label and information provided by General Mills, Fruit Gushers do not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, it’s important to note that they are not certified gluten-free, which means there is a possibility of cross-contamination during manufacturing.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients in Fruit Gushers</h3>
    <p>The primary ingredients in Fruit Gushers include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pear puree concentrate</li>
        <li>Corn syrup</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Modified corn starch</li>
        <li>Fruit juice concentrate</li>
        <li>Citric acid</li>
        <li>Natural and artificial flavors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>None of these ingredients contain gluten, which is a positive sign for those avoiding gluten. However, the lack of a gluten-free certification means that there could be a risk of cross-contamination with gluten-containing products during production.</p>

    <h3>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination</h3>
    <p>General Mills manufactures a wide range of products, some of which contain gluten. While the company has stringent cleaning protocols to prevent cross-contamination, the possibility still exists. For individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, this could be a concern.</p>
