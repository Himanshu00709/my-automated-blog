    <h2>Health Benefits of Quackers Crackers</h2>

    <p>Quackers Crackers offer several health benefits, making them a smart choice for anyone looking to improve their diet. Here are some of the key benefits:</p>

    <h3>1. Gluten-Free and Safe for Celiac Disease</h3>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding safe and tasty snack options can be a challenge. Quackers Crackers are certified gluten-free, meaning they contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease. This makes them a reliable option for those who need to avoid gluten in their diet.</p>

    <h3>2. Rich in Fiber</h3>

    <p>The combination of gluten-free grains and seeds in Quackers Crackers provides a good amount of dietary fiber. Fiber is essential for maintaining a healthy digestive system, promoting regular bowel movements, and preventing constipation.

    <h3>3. Source of Plant-Based Protein</h3>

    <p>Quackers Crackers contain a modest amount of protein, which is derived from plant-based sources like quinoa and chia seeds. Protein is essential for building and repairing tissues, supporting immune function, and maintaining muscle mass. For those following a vegetarian or vegan diet, Quackers Crackers can be a convenient way to add a bit more protein to their meals.</p>

    <h3>4. Low in Sodium</h3>

    <p>Many snack foods are notoriously high in sodium, which can contribute to high blood pressure and other health issues.

With just 150mg of sodium per serving, they are a better option compared to many other crackers on the market.</p>
