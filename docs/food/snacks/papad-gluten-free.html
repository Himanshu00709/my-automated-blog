    <h1>Papad: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>Papad, also known as papadum, is a thin, crispy Indian flatbread that has been a staple in Indian cuisine for centuries. Traditionally made from lentil, chickpea, or rice flour, papad is a versatile snack that can be enjoyed in various ways. In recent years, papad has gained popularity among those following gluten-free diets, as it is naturally free from gluten when made with the right ingredients. This article delves into the world of papad, exploring its gluten-free nature, nutritional benefits, and how you can incorporate it into your diet.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Papad Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Papad is typically made from gluten-free flours such as urad dal (black gram), moong dal (mung bean), or rice flour. These flours are naturally devoid of gluten, making papad an excellent choice for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it's essential to check the ingredients list, as some commercial papads may contain wheat flour or other gluten-containing additives. Always opt for brands that clearly label their products as gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Papad</h2>
    <p>Papad is not only gluten-free but also packed with nutrients. Depending on the type of flour used, papad can be a good source of protein, fiber, and essential minerals. For instance, urad dal papad is rich in protein and iron, while rice flour papad is lighter and easier to digest. Below is a table summarizing the nutritional content of different types of papad:</p>
