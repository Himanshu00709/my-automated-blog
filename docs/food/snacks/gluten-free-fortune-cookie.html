<h1>Gluten-Free Fortune Cookies: A Delicious Twist on a Classic Treat</h1>

<p>Fortune cookies have long been a staple of Chinese-American cuisine, often served at the end of a meal in Chinese restaurants. These crispy, sweet treats are known for the small slips of paper tucked inside, offering words of wisdom, predictions, or even lucky numbers. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, traditional fortune cookies are off the menu due to their wheat-based ingredients. Enter gluten-free fortune cookies—a delightful alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this iconic dessert without compromising their health.</p>

<h2>What Are Gluten-Free Fortune Cookies?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free fortune cookies are made without any wheat, barley, or rye, which are the primary sources of gluten. Instead, they use gluten-free flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or a blend of gluten-free starches. The result is a cookie that is just as crispy and sweet as the traditional version but safe for those who need to avoid gluten. These cookies are often made with the same care and attention to detail as their gluten-containing counterparts, ensuring that they retain the classic fortune cookie shape and texture.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Fortune Cookies?</h2>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Gluten-free fortune cookies provide a safe and enjoyable way to partake in this beloved tradition without the risk of adverse reactions. Additionally, gluten-free diets have gained popularity among those without gluten-related health issues, as many people find that reducing gluten intake can lead to improved digestion and overall well-being.</p>
