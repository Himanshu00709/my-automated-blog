    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Peanut Brittle</h2>
    <p>Making peanut brittle at home is a fun and rewarding process. Follow these steps to create your own gluten-free peanut brittle:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare Your Ingredients:</strong> Measure out all of your ingredients and have them ready to go. This will make the cooking process much smoother.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Sugar Mixture:</strong> In a large saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup, and water. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved. Once the sugar has dissolved, stop stirring and allow the mixture to come to a boil.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Peanuts:</strong> Once the sugar mixture reaches 240°F (115°C) on a candy thermometer, add the peanuts. Continue to cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, until it reaches 300°F (150°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Butter and Baking Soda:</strong> Remove the saucepan from the heat and quickly stir in the butter, baking soda, and salt. The mixture will foam up, so be careful.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread the Brittle:</strong> Immediately pour the mixture onto a greased baking sheet or silicone mat. Use a spatula to spread the brittle into an even layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Break:</strong> Allow the brittle to cool completely, then break it into pieces. Store in an airtight container.</li>
    </ol>

        <p>Homemade peanut brittle can last for up to two weeks when stored in an airtight container at room temperature. For longer storage, you can keep it in the refrigerator for up to a month.</p>

        <h3>Can I make peanut brittle without a candy thermometer?</h3>
