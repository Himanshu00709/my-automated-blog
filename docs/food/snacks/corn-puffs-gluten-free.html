    <h1>Corn Puffs: A Gluten-Free Snack Revolution</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and the general desire for healthier eating options. Among the plethora of gluten-free snacks available today, corn puffs have emerged as a popular choice. These light, airy, and crunchy snacks are not only delicious but also cater to the dietary needs of those avoiding gluten. In this article, we will delve into the world of corn puffs, exploring their benefits, nutritional value, and why they are a fantastic gluten-free snack option.</p>

    <h2>What Are Corn Puffs?</h2>

    <p>Corn puffs are a type of snack made from cornmeal that is expanded through a process called extrusion. This process involves heating the cornmeal under high pressure, which causes it to puff up and create a light, airy texture. The result is a snack that is both crunchy and satisfying, making it a favorite among both children and adults.</p>

    <p>One of the key advantages of corn puffs is that they are naturally gluten-free. Unlike wheat-based snacks, corn puffs do not contain gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye that can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. This makes corn puffs a safe and enjoyable snack option for those on a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Corn Puffs</h2>

    <p>Corn puffs are not only gluten-free but also offer several nutritional benefits. They are typically low in fat and calories, making them a healthier alternative to many other snack options. Additionally, corn puffs are a good source of carbohydrates, providing a quick source of energy. Some varieties of corn puffs are also fortified with vitamins and minerals, further enhancing their nutritional profile.</p>

    <p>Here is a breakdown of the nutritional content of a typical serving of corn puffs:</p>
