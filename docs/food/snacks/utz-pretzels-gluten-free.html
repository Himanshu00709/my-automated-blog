    <h1>Utz Pretzels Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding snacks that are both delicious and safe to eat can be a challenge. Utz, a well-known brand in the snack industry, has been a favorite for many years. But are Utz pretzels gluten-free? In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about Utz pretzels and their gluten-free options, including ingredients, nutritional information, and where to find them.</p>

    <h2>What Are Utz Pretzels?</h2>

    <p>Utz Quality Foods, LLC, commonly known as Utz, is an American snack food company that has been in business since 1921. The company is famous for its wide range of snack products, including potato chips, pretzels, cheese balls, and more. Utz pretzels, in particular, have gained a loyal following due to their crunchy texture and satisfying flavor.</p>

    <p>However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, the primary concern is whether these pretzels contain gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause severe health issues for those who are intolerant or allergic to it.</p>

    <h2>Are Utz Pretzels Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Unfortunately, traditional Utz pretzels are not gluten-free. They are made from wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, Utz has recognized the growing demand for gluten-free snacks and has introduced a line of gluten-free pretzels to cater to this market.</p>

    <p>Utz's gluten-free pretzels are made with alternative flours such as rice flour and tapioca starch, which do not contain gluten. These pretzels are designed to provide the same satisfying crunch and flavor as their traditional counterparts but without the gluten.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Utz Gluten-Free Pretzels</h2>
