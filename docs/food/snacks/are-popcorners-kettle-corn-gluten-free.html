<h1>Are Popcorners Kettle Corn Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>Popcorners have become a popular snack choice for many, thanks to their light, crunchy texture and delicious flavors. Among the variety of options available, Kettle Corn is a fan favorite. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question arises: Are Popcorners Kettle Corn gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to provide a comprehensive answer.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial for these individuals to ensure that the snacks they consume are free from gluten.</p>

<p>When it comes to Popcorners Kettle Corn, the primary concern is whether the ingredients and manufacturing processes are free from gluten contamination. Let’s break it down.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Popcorners Kettle Corn</h2>

<p>To determine if Popcorners Kettle Corn is gluten-free, we first need to examine the ingredients list. Here’s a typical list of ingredients found in Popcorners Kettle Corn:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Whole Grain Corn</li>
    <li>Sunflower Oil</li>
    <li>Cane Sugar</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, these ingredients appear to be gluten-free. Whole grain corn is naturally gluten-free, and sunflower oil, cane sugar, and salt are also free from gluten. However, it’s important to consider the possibility of cross-contamination during the manufacturing process.</p>

<h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination</h2>

<p>Even if the ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur if the product is manufactured in a facility that also processes gluten-containing products. This is a critical factor for individuals with celiac disease, as even trace amounts of gluten can trigger symptoms.</p>

<p>Popcorners are produced by <strong>BFY Brands</strong>, a company that takes food safety and allergen control seriously. According to the company, Popcorners Kettle Corn is manufactured in a facility that does not process wheat, barley, or rye. This significantly reduces the risk of cross-contamination.</p>

<h2>Certifications and Labels</h2>

<p>Another way to determine if a product is gluten-free is to look for certifications and labels. Popcorners Kettle Corn is certified gluten-free by the <strong>Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO)</strong>. This certification ensures that the product contains less than 10 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most individuals with celiac disease.</p>
