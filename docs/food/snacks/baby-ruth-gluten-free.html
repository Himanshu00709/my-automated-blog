    <h1>Baby Ruth Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding delicious and safe snacks can be a challenge. Baby Ruth, a classic candy bar known for its combination of peanuts, caramel, nougat, and chocolate, has been a favorite for decades. But is Baby Ruth gluten-free? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and alternatives to help you make an informed decision about whether Baby Ruth is a safe choice for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Baby Ruth?</h2>
    <p>Baby Ruth is a popular candy bar that has been around since the 1920s. It’s known for its unique combination of flavors and textures, including peanuts, caramel, nougat, and milk chocolate. The candy bar has a rich history and has remained a staple in the candy aisle for generations. But for those who need to avoid gluten, the question remains: is Baby Ruth safe to eat?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Baby Ruth</h2>
    <p>To determine whether Baby Ruth is gluten-free, it’s essential to look at the ingredients. The primary ingredients in a standard Baby Ruth bar include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, chocolate, skim milk, lactose, milkfat, soy lecithin, artificial flavor)</li>
        <li>Peanuts</li>
        <li>Corn syrup</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Palm kernel oil</li>
        <li>Skim milk</li>
        <li>Lactose</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Egg whites</li>
        <li>Artificial flavor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, the presence of gluten can sometimes be hidden in additives or cross-contamination during manufacturing.</p>

    <h2>Is Baby Ruth Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>According to the manufacturer, Nestlé, Baby Ruth does not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, the company does not claim that Baby Ruth is gluten-free. This is because the candy bars are produced in facilities that also process products containing gluten, which raises the risk of cross-contamination.</p>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivities, even trace amounts of gluten can cause adverse reactions. Therefore, while Baby Ruth may not contain gluten ingredients, it may not be safe for those who need to strictly avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Baby Ruth</h2>
