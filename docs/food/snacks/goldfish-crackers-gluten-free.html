    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact on Health</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, consuming gluten is not a problem. However, for individuals with celiac disease, gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the lining of the small intestine. This can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and nutrient deficiencies. Even for those without celiac disease, gluten sensitivity can cause discomfort and other health issues. Therefore, it’s crucial for individuals with these conditions to avoid gluten-containing foods, including traditional Goldfish crackers.</p>

    <h2>How to Identify Gluten-Free Snacks</h2>

    <p>When shopping for gluten-free snacks, it’s important to read labels carefully. Look for products that are certified gluten-free, as this ensures that they meet strict standards for gluten content. Additionally, be aware of cross-contamination, which can occur when gluten-free products are processed in facilities that also handle gluten-containing ingredients. Many brands now offer gluten-free versions of popular snacks, so you don’t have to miss out on your favorites.</p>
