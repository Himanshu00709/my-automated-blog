<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free Nutter Butter cookies.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add the Peanut Butter</h3>
<p>Add the peanut butter to the butter mixture and mix until smooth and creamy.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Shape the Cookies</h3>
<p>Using a cookie scoop or your hands, shape the dough into small balls and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Flatten each ball slightly with a fork, creating a crisscross pattern on top.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Bake the Cookies</h3>
<p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Nutter Butter Cookies</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll achieve perfect results every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. A blend of almond flour and oat flour works well, but you can also use a pre-made gluten-free flour mix.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky, chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before shaping the cookies.</li>
    <li><strong>Watch the Baking Time:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can burn easily, so keep an eye on them and remove them from the oven as soon as the edges are golden.</li>
</ul>
