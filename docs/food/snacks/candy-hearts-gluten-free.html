<h1>Candy Hearts: A Gluten-Free Treat for Everyone</h1>

<p>Candy hearts, those iconic pastel-colored confections adorned with sweet messages, have been a staple of Valentine's Day celebrations for generations. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying these treats can be a challenge. Fortunately, many candy hearts are now available in gluten-free versions, making them accessible to everyone. In this article, we'll explore the world of gluten-free candy hearts, their ingredients, and why they're a great option for those avoiding gluten.</p>

<h2>What Are Candy Hearts?</h2>

<p>Candy hearts, also known as conversation hearts, are small, heart-shaped candies that are typically made from sugar, corn syrup, and flavorings.
