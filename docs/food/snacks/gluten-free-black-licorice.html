<h1>Gluten-Free Black Licorice: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Black licorice has been a beloved treat for centuries, known for its unique flavor and chewy texture. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a safe and delicious option can be challenging. Enter gluten-free black licorice—a delightful alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this classic candy without worry. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free black licorice, from its ingredients to its health benefits, and even how to make your own at home.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten-Free Black Licorice?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free black licorice is a type of candy that is made without any gluten-containing ingredients. Traditional licorice often contains wheat flour or other gluten-based additives, which can be harmful to individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Gluten-free versions use alternative flours and starches, such as rice flour or potato starch, to achieve the same chewy texture without the gluten.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that not all black licorice is created equal. Some brands may still contain trace amounts of gluten due to cross-contamination during manufacturing. Therefore, it’s crucial to look for products that are certified gluten-free to ensure they meet strict safety standards.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Gluten-Free Black Licorice</h2>
