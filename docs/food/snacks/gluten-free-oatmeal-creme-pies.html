<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Oatmeal Creme Pies</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free oatmeal creme pies at home is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a batch of delicious, gluten-free treats:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cookie Dough</h3>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs (or egg substitute) and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Fold in the certified gluten-free oats.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Bake the Cookies</h3>
<p>Drop spoonfuls of the dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Flatten each dough ball slightly with the back of a spoon. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Prepare the Creme Filling</h3>
<p>While the cookies are cooling, prepare the creme filling. In a mixing bowl, combine marshmallow fluff (or vegan marshmallow cream) with softened butter or vegan butter. Beat until smooth and creamy. If desired, add a splash of vanilla extract for extra flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Assemble the Creme Pies</h3>
<p>Once the cookies are completely cool, spread a generous amount of the creme filling onto the flat side of one cookie. Top with another cookie, pressing gently to create a sandwich. Repeat with the remaining cookies and filling.</p>
