    <h1>Gluten-Free Waffle Fries: A Crispy Delight for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Waffle fries are a beloved snack and side dish, known for their unique grid-like shape and satisfying crunch. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying traditional waffle fries can be a challenge due to potential cross-contamination or hidden gluten in the ingredients. Enter gluten-free waffle fries—a delicious, safe alternative that allows everyone to indulge in this crispy treat without worry.
