    <h2>How to Make Seed Crackers at Home</h2>

    <p>Making seed crackers at home is surprisingly easy and allows you to customize the ingredients to your liking. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup flaxseeds</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chia seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sunflower seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pumpkin seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine all the seeds, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder.</li>
        <li>Add the water and mix well until all the seeds are evenly coated. Let the mixture sit for about 10 minutes to allow the seeds to absorb the water and form a gel-like consistency.</li>
        <li>Spread the seed mixture evenly onto the prepared baking sheet, using a spatula to press it down into a thin, even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the crackers are dry and crispy. You may need to flip them halfway through baking to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Once baked, remove from the oven and let cool completely before breaking into pieces.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why Choose Seed Crackers Over Traditional Crackers?</h2>

    <p>Traditional crackers are often made with refined flour, which lacks the nutritional value found in whole grains. Additionally, many store-bought crackers contain added sugars, preservatives, and unhealthy fats. Seed crackers, on the other hand, are made from whole, natural ingredients that provide a host of health benefits. They are also more filling, thanks to their high fiber and protein content, making them a satisfying snack that can help curb hunger between meals.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Seed Crackers</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Are seed crackers suitable for a keto diet?</h3>
