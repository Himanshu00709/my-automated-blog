    <h1>Gluten-Free Hershey Bars: A Sweet Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding delicious and safe treats can be a challenge. Fortunately, Hershey's has stepped up to the plate with their gluten-free Hershey bars. These iconic chocolate bars are not only a nostalgic favorite but also a safe option for those avoiding gluten. In this article, we’ll dive into everything you need to know about gluten-free Hershey bars, from their ingredients to their nutritional value, and why they’re a must-have in your pantry.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Hershey Bars Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Hershey’s has always been known for its simple yet delicious chocolate bars. The classic Hershey’s Milk Chocolate Bar is made with just a few ingredients: milk chocolate (sugar, milk, chocolate, cocoa butter, lactose, milk fat, soy lecithin, and natural flavor). The good news is that none of these ingredients contain gluten, making the classic Hershey bar naturally gluten-free.</p>
    <p>However, it’s important to note that while the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. Hershey’s has taken steps to minimize this risk, but they do not certify their products as gluten-free. For those with severe gluten allergies or celiac disease, it’s always best to check the packaging or contact the manufacturer for the most up-to-date information.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Value of Gluten-Free Hershey Bars</h2>
    <p>While Hershey bars are a treat, it’s still important to understand their nutritional content. Here’s a breakdown of the nutritional value of a standard 1.55 oz (43g) Hershey’s Milk Chocolate Bar:</p>
