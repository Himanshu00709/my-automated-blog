<h1>Gluten-Free Snacks at Gas Stations: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding safe and delicious snacks while on the go can be a challenge. Gas stations, often seen as a haven for junk food, are not typically associated with gluten-free options.
