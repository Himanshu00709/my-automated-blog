    <h1>Buy Gluten-Free Snacks: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free snacks has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of gluten-related health issues and the growing popularity of gluten-free diets. Whether you have celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply prefer to avoid gluten, finding delicious and nutritious gluten-free snacks can be a challenge. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about buying gluten-free snacks, from understanding what gluten is to discovering the best options available in the market.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Avoid It?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of health issues, including digestive problems, skin rashes, and even neurological symptoms. Avoiding gluten is essential for these individuals to maintain their health and well-being.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Snacks</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free snacks offer several benefits, especially for those who need to avoid gluten. These snacks are typically made from alternative grains and ingredients that are naturally gluten-free, such as rice, quinoa, corn, and nuts. Here are some key benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Digestion:</strong> For individuals with gluten intolerance, gluten-free snacks can help alleviate digestive issues such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Nutrient Absorption:</strong> Gluten-free snacks can improve nutrient absorption in individuals with celiac disease, as their intestines heal from gluten-induced damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety and Flavor:</strong> Gluten-free snacks come in a wide range of flavors and textures, offering something for everyone.</li>
