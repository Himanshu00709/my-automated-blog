    <h1>Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookies: A Delicious Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and for good reason. Whether you're managing celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply opting for a healthier lifestyle, gluten-free baking has become a culinary art form. Among the many delightful gluten-free treats, peanut butter sandwich cookies stand out as a crowd-pleaser. These cookies are not only delicious but also easy to make, making them a perfect snack or dessert for any occasion.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free peanut butter sandwich cookies are a fantastic alternative to traditional cookies. They offer the same rich, nutty flavor and satisfying texture without the gluten.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing the Cookie Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the peanut butter, egg, and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a smooth dough forms.</p>

    <h3>2. Shaping and Baking the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, portion out the dough into small balls and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Flatten each ball slightly with the back of a fork, creating a crisscross pattern. Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>3. Making the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the cookies are cooling, prepare the filling. In a small bowl, mix together the powdered sugar and milk until smooth. The filling should be thick but spreadable. If it's too thick, add a little more milk; if it's too thin, add more powdered sugar.</p>

    <h3>4. Assembling the Sandwich Cookies</h3>
    <p>Once the cookies are completely cool, spread a generous amount of the filling on the flat side of one cookie. Top it with another cookie, flat side down, to create a sandwich. Repeat with the remaining cookies and filling. Allow the cookies to set for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough if necessary:</strong> If the dough is too soft to handle, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before shaping the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with fillings:</strong> While the classic powdered sugar filling is delicious, you can also try using jam, chocolate ganache, or even a different nut butter for variety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different nut butter instead of peanut butter?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute peanut butter with almond butter, cashew butter, or any other nut butter of your choice. Just keep in mind that the flavor and texture may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make vegan gluten-free peanut butter sandwich cookies, replace the butter with a plant-based alternative and use a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of a regular egg. For the filling, use a plant-based milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies (without the filling) for up to 2 months. Thaw them at room temperature and add the filling before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add chocolate to these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add chocolate chips to the cookie dough or drizzle melted chocolate over the finished cookies for an extra indulgent treat.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free peanut butter sandwich cookies are a delightful treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions. With their rich, nutty flavor and satisfying texture, these cookies are sure to become a favorite in your household. Whether you're baking for a special occasion or just craving a sweet snack, these cookies are easy to make and incredibly versatile.
