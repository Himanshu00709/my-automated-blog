    <h2>Why These Ingredients Matter</h2>

    <p>The combination of corn starch, potato starch, tapioca starch, and rice flour is what makes Snyder's gluten-free pretzels unique. These ingredients work together to mimic the texture and taste of traditional pretzels without the use of gluten. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, is responsible for the chewy texture of regular pretzels. By using alternative starches and flours, Snyder's has managed to create a product that is both gluten-free and satisfying.</p>

    <p>Palm oil, while controversial due to environmental concerns, is used in moderation to achieve the desired crunchiness. It is a stable fat that doesn't break down easily during frying, ensuring that the pretzels maintain their texture. Salt and sugar are added in minimal amounts to enhance the flavor without overpowering the natural taste of the pretzels.</p>
