<h1>Gluten-Free Soft Corn Tortillas: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the desire for healthier dietary choices. Among the many gluten-free options available, soft corn tortillas have emerged as a versatile and delicious staple. Whether you're making tacos, enchiladas, or simply enjoying them with a spread of guacamole, gluten-free soft corn tortillas are a fantastic addition to any meal. In this article, we'll explore everything you need to know about these tortillas, from their nutritional benefits to how to make them at home.</p>

<h2>What Are Gluten-Free Soft Corn Tortillas?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free soft corn tortillas are a type of flatbread made primarily from masa harina, a flour derived from corn that has been treated with lime (calcium hydroxide). This process, known as nixtamalization, not only enhances the nutritional value of the corn but also gives the tortillas their distinctive flavor and texture.

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Soft Corn Tortillas at Home</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free soft corn tortillas at home is easier than you might think. With just a few simple ingredients and some basic kitchen tools, you can create fresh, homemade tortillas that are far superior to store-bought versions. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups masa harina</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the masa harina and salt (if using). Gradually add the warm water, mixing with your hands until a soft dough forms. The dough should be pliable but not sticky.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into 12 equal portions and roll each portion into a ball. Cover the dough balls with a damp cloth to prevent them from drying out.</li>
    <li>Preheat a skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. If you have a tortilla press, place a dough ball between two pieces of plastic wrap or parchment paper and press until it forms a thin, round tortilla. If you don't have a press, you can use a rolling pin to flatten the dough balls into thin circles.</li>
    <li>Carefully peel the tortilla from the plastic wrap and place it on the hot skillet. Cook for about 30 seconds on each side, or until the tortilla starts to puff up and develop light brown spots.</li>
    <li>Transfer the cooked tortilla to a plate and cover with a clean kitchen towel to keep them warm and soft. Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls.</li>
</ol>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Soft Corn Tortillas</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Are all corn tortillas gluten-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, traditional corn tortillas made from 100% masa harina are naturally gluten-free. However, it's always important to check the label, as some brands may add wheat flour or other gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of a tortilla press?</h3>
    <p>If you don't have a tortilla press, you can use a rolling pin to flatten the dough balls into thin circles. Alternatively, you can use a heavy flat-bottomed pan or even a glass pie plate to press the dough.</p>
