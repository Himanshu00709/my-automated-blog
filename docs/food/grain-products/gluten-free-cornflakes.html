    <h1>Gluten-Free Cornflakes: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by an increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders and a growing preference for healthier dietary choices. Among the many gluten-free options available, gluten-free cornflakes have emerged as a popular breakfast staple. But what exactly are gluten-free cornflakes, and why are they gaining so much attention? In this article, we’ll delve into the world of gluten-free cornflakes, exploring their benefits, nutritional value, and how they compare to traditional cornflakes.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Cornflakes?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free cornflakes are a type of breakfast cereal made primarily from corn, which is naturally gluten-free. However, not all cornflakes on the market are gluten-free. Traditional cornflakes may contain added ingredients or be processed in facilities that handle gluten-containing grains, such as wheat, barley, or rye. Gluten-free cornflakes, on the other hand, are specifically manufactured to avoid cross-contamination and are certified gluten-free, making them safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Cornflakes</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free cornflakes offer several benefits, particularly for those who need to avoid gluten. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Safe for Celiac Disease and Gluten Sensitivity:</strong> Gluten-free cornflakes are a safe option for individuals with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, as they do not contain gluten proteins that can trigger adverse reactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Digestive Health:</strong> For those with gluten intolerance, consuming gluten-free cornflakes can help alleviate symptoms such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea, promoting better digestive health.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Gluten-free cornflakes can be enjoyed in various ways, from a simple bowl of cereal with milk to being used as a crunchy topping for desserts or as an ingredient in baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Many gluten-free cornflakes are fortified with essential vitamins and minerals, making them a nutritious breakfast option.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nutritional Comparison: Gluten-Free vs. Traditional Cornflakes</h2>

    <p>When comparing gluten-free cornflakes to traditional cornflakes, it’s important to consider their nutritional profiles. Below is a table that highlights the key differences:</p>
