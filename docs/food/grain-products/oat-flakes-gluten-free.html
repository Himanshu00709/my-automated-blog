    <h1>Oat Flakes: A Gluten-Free Superfood</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Among the many gluten-free options available, oat flakes have emerged as a popular choice for their nutritional benefits and versatility. But are oat flakes truly gluten-free? In this article, we will explore the gluten-free nature of oat flakes, their health benefits, and how to incorporate them into your diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Oat Flakes?</h2>
    <p>Oat flakes, also known as rolled oats, are made from whole oat groats that have been steamed, rolled, and flattened. They are a staple in many households, commonly used in breakfast cereals, granola bars, and baked goods. Oat flakes are rich in fiber, protein, and essential nutrients, making them a nutritious addition to any diet.</p>

    <h2>Are Oat Flakes Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Oats are naturally gluten-free, but the issue of cross-contamination often arises during processing. Oats are frequently grown, harvested, and processed alongside gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye. This can lead to the presence of gluten in oat products, even if the oats themselves are gluten-free.</p>
    <p>To ensure that oat flakes are truly gluten-free, it is essential to look for products that are certified gluten-free. These products are processed in dedicated facilities and tested to meet strict gluten-free standards, typically containing less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Oat Flakes</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free oat flakes offer a wide range of health benefits, making them an excellent choice for those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or anyone looking to improve their overall health. Here are some of the key benefits:</p>
