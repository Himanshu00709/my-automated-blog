<h1>Gluten-Free Pasta Shells: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

The absence of gluten does not compromise their taste or texture, and with the right preparation, they can be just as satisfying as traditional pasta.</p>

<h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Pasta Shells</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free pasta shells requires a slightly different approach compared to traditional pasta. Here are some tips to ensure perfect results every time:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so use a large pot of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Stir the pasta occasionally to prevent clumping and ensure even cooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can go from perfectly cooked to overcooked quickly, so start checking a minute or two before the package's suggested cooking time.</li>
    <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Rinsing gluten-free pasta can remove the starch that helps sauces adhere, so it's generally best to avoid rinsing unless the recipe specifically calls for it.</li>
