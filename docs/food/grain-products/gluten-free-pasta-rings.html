<h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Pasta Rings</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free pasta rings is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to keep in mind to ensure the best results:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so it's important to use a large pot of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Stir the pasta occasionally to prevent it from clumping together.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can cook faster than traditional pasta, so start checking for doneness a minute or two before the recommended cooking time on the package.</li>
    <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Unlike traditional pasta, gluten-free pasta should not be rinsed after cooking, as this can remove the starch that helps the sauce adhere to the pasta.</li>
</ul>
