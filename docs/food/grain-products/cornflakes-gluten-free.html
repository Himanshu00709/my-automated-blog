    <h1>Are Cornflakes Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Cornflakes have been a breakfast staple for decades, loved for their crisp texture and versatility. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether cornflakes are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten content in cornflakes, how to identify gluten-free options, and provide tips for maintaining a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Does It Matter?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, understanding whether a food product like cornflakes contains gluten is essential for those following a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Are Cornflakes Naturally Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Corn itself is naturally gluten-free, which means that pure cornflakes made solely from corn should not contain gluten. However, the manufacturing process often introduces gluten into the product. Many commercial cornflakes are produced in facilities that also process wheat, barley, or rye, leading to cross-contamination. Additionally, some brands add malt flavoring, which is derived from barley and contains gluten.</p>

    <h2>How to Identify Gluten-Free Cornflakes</h2>
    <p>When shopping for gluten-free cornflakes, it’s important to read labels carefully. Look for products that are certified gluten-free by reputable organizations. These certifications ensure that the product meets strict gluten-free standards and has been tested for gluten content. Here are some key things to look for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Certified Gluten-Free Label:</strong> This indicates that the product has been tested and contains less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the safe threshold for most people with celiac disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Ingredients List:</strong> Avoid cornflakes that list wheat, barley, rye, or malt flavoring in the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Manufacturing Practices:</strong> Some brands specify that their products are made in a gluten-free facility, reducing the risk of cross-contamination.</li>
    </ul>
