    <h3>2. Oatmeal Raisin Cookies</h3>

    <h2>Tips for Baking Gluten, Dairy, and Nut-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Baking allergen-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with the right techniques, you can achieve delicious results. Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Measure Accurately:</strong> Gluten-free flours can behave differently than wheat flour, so it's important to measure your ingredients carefully to ensure the right texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Binder:</strong> Since gluten-free flours lack the binding properties of wheat flour, adding a binder like xanthan gum or psyllium husk can help hold the cookies together.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Chilling the dough before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much and losing their shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Don't be afraid to experiment with different flavors and add-ins, such as dried fruit, seeds, or spices, to create unique and delicious cookies.</li>
    </ul>
