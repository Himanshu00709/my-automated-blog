    <h1>Are Mike and Ikes Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Mike and Ikes are a popular candy brand known for their chewy, fruity flavors. Whether you're a long-time fan or new to the candy, you might be wondering: Are Mike and Ikes gluten-free? For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, this is a crucial question. In this article, we'll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to determine if Mike and Ikes are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, it's essential to scrutinize food labels and understand the manufacturing processes of the products we consume.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Mike and Ikes</h2>

    <p>To determine if Mike and Ikes are gluten-free, let's first look at their ingredients. The primary ingredients in Mike and Ikes include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Corn syrup</li>
        <li>Modified food starch</li>
        <li>Citric acid</li>
        <li>Natural and artificial flavors</li>
        <li>Artificial colors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, the term "modified food starch" can be a point of concern. Modified food starch can be derived from various sources, including wheat. Therefore, it's essential to investigate further.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can introduce gluten into the product. Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-containing products are processed on the same equipment as gluten-free products. To ensure safety, many manufacturers label their products as "gluten-free" if they meet specific standards.</p>

    <p>Mike and Ikes are manufactured by Just Born, a company that produces a variety of candies. According to Just Born, Mike and Ikes are considered gluten-free. However, they do not carry a certified gluten-free label. This means that while the ingredients and manufacturing processes are designed to avoid gluten, there is no third-party verification to confirm the absence of gluten.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification and Labels</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free certification is provided by organizations such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO) and the Celiac Support Association (CSA). These certifications require rigorous testing and adherence to strict standards to ensure that products contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

    <p>While Mike and Ikes do not have a certified gluten-free label, the manufacturer states that they are gluten-free. This is a common practice among candy manufacturers, as the cost and process of obtaining certification can be prohibitive for some companies.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Information and Allergens</h2>

    <p>Below is a table summarizing the nutritional information and allergen details for Mike and Ikes:</p>

    <table>
