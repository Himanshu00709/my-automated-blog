    <h1>Gluten-Free Ricotta: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Ricotta cheese is a versatile and delicious ingredient that has been a staple in Italian cuisine for centuries. Its creamy texture and mild flavor make it a favorite in both savory and sweet dishes. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether ricotta is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free ricotta, including its benefits, how to use it, and some delicious recipes to try at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Ricotta Cheese?</h2>

    <p>Ricotta is a traditional Italian whey cheese made from the whey left over from the production of other cheeses, such as mozzarella or provolone. The word "ricotta" means "recooked" in Italian, referring to the process of reheating the whey to separate the curds. The result is a soft, creamy cheese with a slightly sweet flavor and a grainy texture. Ricotta is commonly used in dishes like lasagna, cannoli, and stuffed pasta, but it can also be enjoyed on its own or as a spread.</p>

    <h2>Is Ricotta Cheese Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>In its purest form, ricotta cheese is naturally gluten-free. The primary ingredients in ricotta are whey, milk, and an acid (such as vinegar or lemon juice) to help coagulate the proteins. None of these ingredients contain gluten. However, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process if the ricotta is produced in a facility that also processes gluten-containing products. Additionally, some flavored or pre-packaged ricotta products may contain additives or thickeners that contain gluten. Therefore, it is essential to read labels carefully and look for products that are certified gluten-free if you have celiac disease or a severe gluten intolerance.</p>
