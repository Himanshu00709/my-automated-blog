One common question that arises is whether Kraft Singles, a popular cheese product, is gluten-free. In this article, we will delve into the details of Kraft Singles, their ingredients, and their suitability for a gluten-free diet. We will also explore the nutritional aspects, potential cross-contamination risks, and provide answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What Are Kraft Singles?</h2>

    <p>Kraft Singles are a type of processed cheese product that has been a staple in American households for decades.
