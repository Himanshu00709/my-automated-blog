Traditional mozzarella cheese is naturally gluten-free, as it is made from milk, salt, and rennet. However, some brands may add gluten-containing ingredients during processing, such as stabilizers or flavorings. Therefore, it's important to carefully read labels or choose brands that are certified gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Mozzarella Cheese</h2>

    <p>Choosing gluten-free mozzarella cheese offers several benefits, especially for those with gluten-related health concerns. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Safe for Celiac Disease:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can damage the small intestine and lead to serious health complications. Gluten-free mozzarella ensures that they can enjoy cheese without risking their health.</li>
        <li><strong>Digestive Comfort:</strong> Many people with gluten sensitivity experience digestive discomfort, such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea, after consuming gluten. Gluten-free mozzarella can help alleviate these symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Gluten-free mozzarella can be used in a wide range of dishes, from pizzas and pastas to salads and sandwiches, making it a versatile ingredient for gluten-free cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Mozzarella cheese is a good source of protein, calcium, and other essential nutrients. Choosing a gluten-free version ensures that you can enjoy these nutritional benefits without the risk of gluten exposure.</li>
