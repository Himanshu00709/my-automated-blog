<h1>Sonic Gluten-Free Items: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the general preference for healthier eating habits.

Even for those with gluten sensitivity, ingesting gluten can cause discomfort and other adverse effects. As a result, many people are opting for gluten-free diets to avoid these complications.</p>

<p>When dining out, it's crucial to identify which menu items are safe for those avoiding gluten. Sonic Drive-In has made strides in offering gluten-free options, but it's essential to understand the limitations and potential cross-contamination risks.</p>

</ul>
