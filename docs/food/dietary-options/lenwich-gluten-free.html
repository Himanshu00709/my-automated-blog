    <h1>Lenwich Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by an increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the desire for healthier eating habits. Lenwich, a popular sandwich and salad chain, has responded to this demand by offering a variety of gluten-free options. This blog post will explore Lenwich's gluten-free offerings, their nutritional benefits, and how they cater to the needs of gluten-sensitive individuals.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Gluten sensitivity, on the other hand, can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue without the intestinal damage seen in celiac disease.</p>

    <p>Going gluten-free involves eliminating all foods that contain gluten. This can be challenging, especially when dining out, as gluten is a common ingredient in many dishes. However, restaurants like Lenwich have made it easier by offering gluten-free options that are both delicious and safe for those with gluten-related disorders.</p>
