    <h1>Gluten-Free Options at Dunkin' Donuts: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply choosing to avoid gluten for health reasons, finding safe and delicious food options can be a challenge. Dunkin' Donuts, a popular coffee and baked goods chain, has made strides in offering gluten-free options to cater to this growing demographic.

    <p>Dunkin' Donuts has recognized the importance of providing gluten-free options, though it’s essential to note that their kitchens are not entirely gluten-free. Cross-contamination is a possibility, so those with severe gluten intolerance should exercise caution.</p>
