Whether you have celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply prefer a gluten-free diet, DP Dough offers a safe and delicious way to enjoy their signature dishes without compromising on taste or quality.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Matters</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to a host of health issues. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can cause discomfort, bloating, and other digestive problems. As awareness of these conditions has grown, so has the demand for gluten-free options in restaurants and food establishments.</p>

    <p>DP Dough has recognized this need and has taken steps to ensure that their gluten-free offerings are not only safe but also delicious. Their gluten-free calzones are made with high-quality ingredients and are prepared with care to avoid cross-contamination, making them a reliable choice for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>
