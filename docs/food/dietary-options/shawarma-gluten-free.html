<h1>Shawarma Gluten-Free: A Delicious and Healthy Option</h1>

<p>Shawarma, a beloved Middle Eastern dish, has gained immense popularity worldwide for its rich flavors and versatility. Traditionally, shawarma is made with marinated meat, such as chicken, beef, or lamb, which is slow-cooked on a vertical rotisserie. The meat is then thinly sliced and served in a wrap, often accompanied by vegetables, sauces, and pickles. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying shawarma can be a challenge due to the gluten-containing wraps. Fortunately, gluten-free shawarma options are becoming increasingly available, allowing everyone to savor this delicious dish without compromising their health.</p>

<h2>What Makes Shawarma Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>To understand what makes shawarma gluten-free, it's essential to identify the components of the dish that typically contain gluten. The primary culprit is the wrap or pita bread used to encase the meat and toppings. Traditional pita bread is made from wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, gluten-free shawarma can be achieved by substituting the wheat-based wrap with a gluten-free alternative, such as corn tortillas, lettuce wraps, or gluten-free pita bread.</p>

<p>Additionally, it's crucial to ensure that the marinade and sauces used in the shawarma are free from gluten-containing ingredients. Some sauces, such as soy sauce, may contain gluten, so it's important to use gluten-free versions or alternatives like tamari. By making these simple substitutions, shawarma can be enjoyed by those following a gluten-free diet.</p>
