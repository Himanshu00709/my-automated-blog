<h1>Dunkin' Gluten-Free Food: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding safe and delicious food options can be a challenge. Dunkin', a popular coffee and baked goods chain, has made strides in offering gluten-free options to cater to this growing demand. In this article, we’ll explore Dunkin's gluten-free offerings, how they handle cross-contamination, and what you can safely enjoy on your next visit.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Needs</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to manage their health. Dunkin' has recognized this need and has introduced several gluten-free options to its menu.</p>

<h2>Dunkin's Gluten-Free Menu Options</h2>

<p>While Dunkin' is primarily known for its donuts and baked goods, which traditionally contain gluten, the chain has expanded its menu to include gluten-free items. Here’s a breakdown of what you can find:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Item</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>

            <td>Gluten-Free Brownie</td>
            <td>A rich, fudgy brownie made without gluten-containing ingredients.</td>

If you have celiac disease or a severe gluten allergy, it’s essential to communicate your needs to the staff and consider the potential risks.</p>
