    <h1>Gluten-Free Poke: A Healthy and Delicious Trend</h1>

    <p>Poke bowls have taken the culinary world by storm, offering a fresh, customizable, and nutritious meal option. Originating from Hawaii, poke (pronounced poh-kay) traditionally consists of diced raw fish, rice, and a variety of toppings and sauces. With the growing demand for gluten-free options, gluten-free poke has emerged as a popular choice for those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free poke, its health benefits, and how you can enjoy this delicious dish without compromising your dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Poke?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free poke is a variation of the traditional Hawaiian dish that eliminates any ingredients containing gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems. By using gluten-free ingredients, poke bowls can be enjoyed safely by those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <p>The key to making gluten-free poke lies in the ingredients. While the base of poke bowls is typically gluten-free (such as rice and raw fish), certain sauces and toppings may contain gluten. For example, soy sauce, a common ingredient in poke marinades, often contains wheat. However, gluten-free soy sauce or tamari can be used as a substitute to ensure the dish remains gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Poke</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free poke offers a range of health benefits, making it an excellent choice for those looking to maintain a balanced diet. Here are some of the key benefits:</p>
