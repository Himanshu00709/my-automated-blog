<h1>Gluten-Free Options at Dunkin': A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply choosing to avoid gluten, finding safe and delicious food options can be a challenge. Dunkin', a popular coffee and baked goods chain, has made strides in offering gluten-free items to cater to this growing demographic. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free options available at Dunkin', provide tips for avoiding cross-contamination, and answer some frequently asked questions about gluten-free dining at Dunkin'.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten can cause discomfort and digestive issues. As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to improve their health and well-being.</p>

<p>Dunkin' recognizes the importance of offering gluten-free options to accommodate these dietary needs. While the chain is primarily known for its donuts and baked goods, which are traditionally high in gluten, Dunkin' has introduced several gluten-free items to its menu.</p>
