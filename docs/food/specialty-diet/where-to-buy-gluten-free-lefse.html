    <h1>Where to Buy Gluten-Free Lefse: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Lefse, a traditional Norwegian flatbread, has been a staple in Scandinavian cuisine for centuries. Made primarily from potatoes, flour, and milk, lefse is a versatile dish that can be enjoyed in both sweet and savory forms. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, traditional lefse can be off-limits due to its wheat flour content.

The texture and taste of gluten-free lefse can vary slightly from the traditional version, but many brands have perfected their recipes to closely mimic the original.</p>
