<h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Thanksgiving: A Guide to a Delicious and Inclusive Feast</h1>

<p>Thanksgiving is a time for gratitude, family, and, of course, food. However, for those with gluten or dairy intolerances, allergies, or dietary preferences, the traditional Thanksgiving feast can be a minefield of potential triggers. But fear not! With a little planning and creativity, you can enjoy a gluten and dairy-free Thanksgiving that is just as delicious and satisfying as the traditional spread. In this guide, we’ll explore how to create a Thanksgiving menu that caters to gluten and dairy-free diets, ensuring everyone at the table can indulge without worry.</p>

<h2>Why Go Gluten and Dairy-Free?</h2>

<p>Gluten and dairy are common allergens and can cause digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems for some individuals. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, while dairy includes milk and milk-based products like cheese, butter, and cream. For those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or lactose intolerance, avoiding these ingredients is essential for maintaining good health. Additionally, many people choose to eliminate gluten and dairy from their diets for personal or ethical reasons, such as reducing inflammation or adopting a plant-based lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Planning Your Gluten and Dairy-Free Thanksgiving Menu</h2>

<p>Creating a gluten and dairy-free Thanksgiving menu doesn’t mean sacrificing flavor or tradition. With the right substitutions and recipes, you can enjoy all the classic dishes you love. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach each course:</p>
