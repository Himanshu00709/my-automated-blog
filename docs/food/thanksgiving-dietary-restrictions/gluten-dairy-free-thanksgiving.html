    <h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Thanksgiving: A Guide to a Delicious and Inclusive Feast</h1>
    <p>Thanksgiving is a time for gratitude, family, and, of course, food. However, for those with gluten or dairy intolerances, allergies, or dietary preferences, the traditional Thanksgiving spread can be a minefield of potential triggers. But fear not! With a little planning and creativity, you can enjoy a gluten and dairy-free Thanksgiving that’s just as delicious and satisfying as the traditional feast. In this guide, we’ll explore how to create a Thanksgiving menu that’s inclusive, flavorful, and free from gluten and dairy.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten and Dairy-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten and dairy are common allergens and can cause discomfort for many people. Gluten, found in wheat, barley, and rye, can trigger symptoms in those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Dairy, on the other hand, can cause issues for those who are lactose intolerant or have a dairy allergy. By offering gluten and dairy-free options, you ensure that everyone at your table can enjoy the meal without worry.</p>

    <h2>Planning Your Gluten and Dairy-Free Thanksgiving Menu</h2>
    <p>Creating a gluten and dairy-free Thanksgiving menu doesn’t mean sacrificing flavor or tradition. With a few substitutions and creative recipes, you can enjoy all the classic dishes without the gluten or dairy. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach each part of the meal:</p>

    <h3>Appetizers</h3>
    <p>Start your meal with light, flavorful appetizers that set the tone for the feast. Consider options like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stuffed Mushrooms:</strong> Use gluten-free breadcrumbs and dairy-free cheese for a delicious bite-sized treat.</li>
        <li><strong>Veggie Platter:</strong> Serve with a dairy-free dip, such as hummus or guacamole.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Crackers:</strong> Pair with a dairy-free cheese spread or nut butter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Main Course</h3>
    <p>The centerpiece of any Thanksgiving meal is the main course. For a gluten and dairy-free Thanksgiving, consider these options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Roast Turkey:</strong> Naturally gluten and dairy-free, just be sure to check the ingredients in any brines or seasonings.</li>
        <li><strong>Stuffed Squash:</strong> Use gluten-free grains like quinoa or rice, and dairy-free cheese for a hearty, flavorful dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegan Lentil Loaf:</strong> A great alternative to traditional meatloaf, packed with protein and flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Side Dishes</h3>
    <p>Side dishes are where you can really get creative. Here are some ideas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mashed Potatoes:</strong> Use dairy-free milk and butter alternatives for a creamy, comforting side.</li>
        <li><strong>Green Bean Casserole:</strong> Make a gluten-free version with almond milk and gluten-free breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Roasted Vegetables:</strong> Toss with olive oil, herbs, and spices for a simple yet flavorful dish.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Desserts</h3>
    <p>No Thanksgiving meal is complete without dessert. Here are some gluten and dairy-free options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pumpkin Pie:</strong> Use a gluten-free crust and dairy-free milk for the filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple Crisp:</strong> Top with a gluten-free oat and nut crumble.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate Mousse:</strong> Made with avocado and cocoa powder for a rich, dairy-free treat.</li>
