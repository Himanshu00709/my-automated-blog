<h2>How to Make a Gluten-Free Brisket Rub</h2>

<p>Making your own gluten-free brisket rub is a straightforward process. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

<h3>Basic Gluten-Free Brisket Rub Recipe</h3>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sea salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix thoroughly.</li>
    <li>Store the rub in an airtight container until ready to use.</li>
    <li>Generously apply the rub to your brisket, ensuring even coverage on all sides.</li>
    <li>Let the brisket sit with the rub for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Applying the Rub</h2>

<p>Applying the rub correctly is crucial for achieving the best flavor and texture. Here are some tips:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Pat the brisket dry:</strong> Before applying the rub, pat the brisket dry with paper towels. This helps the rub adhere better and ensures a good crust.</li>
    <li><strong>Use your hands:</strong> Using your hands to apply the rub allows you to massage the spices into the meat, ensuring even coverage.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t skimp on the rub:</strong> Be generous with the rub, especially on the fatty side of the brisket. This will create a flavorful crust as the fat renders during cooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Let it rest:</strong> After applying the rub, let the brisket rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour, or overnight if possible. This allows the flavors to penetrate the meat.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Brisket Rub</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use store-bought rubs if they’re labeled gluten-free?</h3>
