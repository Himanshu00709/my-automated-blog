<h2>How to Cook Gluten and Corn-Free Pasta</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten and corn-free pasta is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Boiling Water:</strong> Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt to enhance the flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Cooking Time:</strong> Gluten and corn-free pasta may cook faster or slower than traditional pasta, depending on the ingredients. Check the package instructions for the recommended cooking time.</li>
    <li><strong>Stirring:</strong> Stir the pasta occasionally to prevent it from sticking together.</li>
    <li><strong>Testing for Doneness:</strong> Taste the pasta a minute or two before the recommended cooking time to ensure it doesn't become overcooked and mushy.</li>
    <li><strong>Draining:</strong> Once the pasta is cooked to your desired texture, drain it in a colander. Avoid rinsing the pasta, as this can remove the starch that helps sauces adhere to it.</li>
</ol>
