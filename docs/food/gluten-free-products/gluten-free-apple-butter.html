    <h1>Gluten-Free Apple Butter: A Delicious and Healthy Spread</h1>
    <p>Apple butter is a classic spread that has been enjoyed for generations. Its rich, velvety texture and sweet, tangy flavor make it a versatile addition to breakfast tables, baking recipes, and even savory dishes. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding safe and delicious spreads can be a challenge. Fortunately, gluten-free apple butter is not only easy to make but also a nutritious and flavorful option that everyone can enjoy. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free apple butter, how to make it at home, and creative ways to incorporate it into your meals.</p>

    <h2>What is Apple Butter?</h2>
    <p>Apple butter is a concentrated form of apple sauce, made by slow-cooking apples with sugar, spices, and sometimes a bit of vinegar or lemon juice. The long cooking process caramelizes the sugars in the apples, giving the spread its deep, rich flavor and dark brown color. Unlike regular butter, apple butter contains no dairy and is naturally gluten-free, making it a safe option for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Apple Butter?</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, avoiding gluten is essential to maintaining good health. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause severe digestive issues and other health problems for those who are sensitive to it. While many store-bought spreads and condiments may contain hidden gluten, homemade gluten-free apple butter ensures that you’re consuming a safe and wholesome product. Additionally, apple butter is packed with nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants, making it a healthy choice for anyone.</p>
