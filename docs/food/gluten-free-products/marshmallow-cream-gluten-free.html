<h1>Marshmallow Cream Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Marshmallow cream, a fluffy and sweet spread, has been a favorite in kitchens for decades. Whether you're making a classic fluffernutter sandwich or adding it to your favorite dessert recipes, marshmallow cream is a versatile ingredient. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding gluten-free options is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free marshmallow cream, including its ingredients, benefits, and how to use it in your cooking.</p>

<h2>What is Marshmallow Cream?</h2>

<p>Marshmallow cream, also known as marshmallow fluff, is a sweet, spreadable confection made from sugar, corn syrup, egg whites, and vanilla extract. It has a light, airy texture that makes it perfect for spreading on toast, mixing into desserts, or even using as a dip for fruits. Unlike traditional marshmallows, marshmallow cream is not solidified and remains in a creamy, spreadable form.</p>

<h2>Is Marshmallow Cream Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Most marshmallow cream brands are naturally gluten-free, as the primary ingredients—sugar, corn syrup, and egg whites—do not contain gluten. However, it’s essential to check the label for any potential cross-contamination or added ingredients that may contain gluten. Some brands may process their products in facilities that also handle gluten-containing ingredients, which could pose a risk for those with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>
