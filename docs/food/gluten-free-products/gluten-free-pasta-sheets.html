<h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Pasta Sheets</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free pasta sheets requires a slightly different approach compared to traditional pasta. Here are some tips to ensure perfect results:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so use a large pot of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Salt the Water:</strong> Add a generous amount of salt to enhance the flavor of the pasta.</li>
    <li><strong>Follow Package Instructions:</strong> Cooking times may vary depending on the brand and ingredients, so always check the package for guidance.</li>
    <li><strong>Test for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free pasta sheets should be al dente—firm to the bite but not crunchy.</li>
    <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Avoid rinsing the pasta after cooking, as this can remove the starch that helps sauces adhere.</li>
</ol>
