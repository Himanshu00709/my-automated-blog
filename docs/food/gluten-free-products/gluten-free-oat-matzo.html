    <h1>Gluten-Free Oat Matzo: A Healthy and Delicious Alternative</h1>

    <p>Matzo, the unleavened bread traditionally eaten during Passover, has been a staple in Jewish households for centuries. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional wheat-based matzo can be problematic. Enter gluten-free oat matzo—a nutritious and delicious alternative that allows everyone to partake in the Passover tradition without compromising their health. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits, preparation, and nutritional value of gluten-free oat matzo, along with some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Oat Matzo?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free oat matzo is a type of unleavened bread made from oats that are certified gluten-free. Traditional matzo is made from wheat, which contains gluten, a protein that can cause adverse reactions in people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Oats, on the other hand, are naturally gluten-free, but they must be processed in a facility that avoids cross-contamination with gluten-containing grains to be considered truly gluten-free.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free oat matzo is made by mixing oat flour with water, rolling it out into thin sheets, and baking it quickly to prevent fermentation. The result is a crisp, cracker-like bread that is perfect for Passover and can be enjoyed by those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Oat Matzo</h2>

    <p>There are several benefits to choosing gluten-free oat matzo over traditional wheat-based matzo:</p>
