    <h2>How to Use Bob's Gluten-Free Bread Mix</h2>

    <p>Using Bob's Gluten-Free Bread Mix is a straightforward process that yields delicious results. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Gather Your Ingredients:</strong> In addition to the bread mix, you'll need warm water, eggs, oil, and a bit of vinegar. These ingredients help to activate the yeast and improve the texture of the bread.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Ingredients:</strong> Combine the bread mix with the wet ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Stir until the dough comes together. The dough will be sticky, which is normal for gluten-free bread.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Dough Rise:</strong> Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place for about 30-40 minutes. This allows the yeast to work its magic and gives the bread its light, airy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Bread:</strong> Transfer the dough to a greased loaf pan and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 50-60 minutes. The bread is done when it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the bread to cool completely before slicing. This helps to set the crumb and makes it easier to cut.</li>
    </ol>
