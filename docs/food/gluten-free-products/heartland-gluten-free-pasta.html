    <h2>How to Cook Heartland Gluten-Free Pasta</h2>

    <p>Cooking Heartland Gluten-Free Pasta is simple and straightforward, but there are a few tips to ensure that you achieve the perfect texture and flavor:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> When cooking gluten-free pasta, it's important to use a large pot of boiling water to prevent the pasta from sticking together. A good rule of thumb is to use 4-6 quarts of water for every 8 ounces of pasta.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Salt:</strong> Adding a generous amount of salt to the boiling water will enhance the flavor of the pasta. Aim for about 1-2 tablespoons of salt per 4-6 quarts of water.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir Occasionally:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can be more prone to sticking than traditional pasta, so be sure to stir it occasionally during cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free pasta typically cooks faster than wheat-based pasta, so start checking for doneness a minute or two before the recommended cooking time on the package. The pasta should be tender but still firm to the bite (al dente).</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse (Optional):</strong> Some people prefer to rinse gluten-free pasta after cooking to remove excess starch, which can help prevent sticking. However, this step is optional and may not be necessary depending on the recipe.</li>
    </ol>
