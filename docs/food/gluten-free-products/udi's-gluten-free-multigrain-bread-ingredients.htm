    <h2>Why These Ingredients Matter</h2>

    <p>Each ingredient in Udi's Gluten-Free Multigrain Bread serves a specific purpose, ensuring the final product is not only gluten-free but also nutritious and delicious. Let’s explore why these ingredients are so important:</p>

    <h3>1. Tapioca Starch and Potato Starch</h3>
    <p>These starches are essential for creating the soft, chewy texture that gluten-free bread often lacks. They act as binders, replacing the elasticity that gluten typically provides. Additionally, they help retain moisture, preventing the bread from becoming dry or crumbly.</p>

    <h3>2. Brown Rice Flour</h3>
    <p>As the primary flour in the recipe, brown rice flour adds a nutty flavor and a hearty texture. It’s also a good source of fiber, which is often lacking in gluten-free diets. This makes the bread more filling and nutritious.</p>

    <h3>3. Flaxseed and Quinoa</h3>
    <p>These superfoods are packed with nutrients. Flaxseed is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial for heart health, while quinoa provides a complete protein source, containing all nine essential amino acids. Together, they enhance the nutritional profile of the bread.</p>

    <h3>4. Xanthan Gum</h3>
    <p>Xanthan gum is a common ingredient in gluten-free baking. It acts as a stabilizer, improving the texture and elasticity of the bread. Without it, gluten-free bread can be dense and crumbly.</p>
