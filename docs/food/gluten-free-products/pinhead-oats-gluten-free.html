    <h1>Pinhead Oats: A Gluten-Free Superfood</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free foods has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Among the many gluten-free options available, pinhead oats have emerged as a nutritional powerhouse. These tiny, steel-cut oats are not only gluten-free but also packed with essential nutrients, making them a fantastic addition to any diet. In this article, we’ll explore what pinhead oats are, their health benefits, and how you can incorporate them into your daily meals.</p>

    <h2>What Are Pinhead Oats?</h2>
    <p>Pinhead oats, also known as steel-cut oats, are whole oat groats that have been chopped into small pieces using steel blades. Unlike rolled oats, which are steamed and flattened, pinhead oats retain their natural texture and nutty flavor. This minimal processing ensures that they retain most of their nutritional value, making them a healthier choice compared to other oat varieties.</p>
    <p>One of the key reasons pinhead oats are considered gluten-free is that oats themselves do not contain gluten. However, cross-contamination can occur during processing, so it’s essential to choose oats that are certified gluten-free. These oats are processed in facilities that avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Profile of Pinhead Oats</h2>
