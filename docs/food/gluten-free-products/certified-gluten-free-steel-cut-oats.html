<h1>Certified Gluten-Free Steel Cut Oats: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Steel cut oats have long been celebrated for their nutritional benefits, including high fiber content, slow-digesting carbohydrates, and a rich supply of vitamins and minerals. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, the question of whether oats are safe to consume is a critical one. Enter certified gluten-free steel cut oats—a game-changer for those who need to avoid gluten but still want to enjoy the health benefits of oats. In this article, we’ll explore what makes these oats unique, their health benefits, and how to incorporate them into your diet.</p>

<p>Steel cut oats are whole oat groats that have been chopped into smaller pieces, giving them a chewy texture and nutty flavor. Unlike rolled oats or instant oats, steel cut oats are less processed, which helps retain their nutritional value.

Certified gluten-free steel cut oats are produced under strict guidelines to ensure they contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.</p>

<p>Certification involves rigorous testing and adherence to protocols that prevent cross-contamination. This includes using dedicated gluten-free fields, equipment, and facilities. Brands that offer certified gluten-free steel cut oats often display a gluten-free certification logo on their packaging, such as those from the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO) or other recognized bodies.</p>
