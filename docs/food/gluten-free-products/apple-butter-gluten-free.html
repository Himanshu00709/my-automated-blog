<h1>Apple Butter: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of apple butter, how to make it at home, and why it’s a great choice for gluten-free living.</p>

<h2>What is Apple Butter?</h2>

<p>Apple butter is a concentrated form of apple sauce, cooked slowly until the sugars caramelize, giving it a deep, rich flavor and a thick, spreadable consistency.

When in doubt, making your own apple butter at home ensures that it’s 100% gluten-free.</p>
