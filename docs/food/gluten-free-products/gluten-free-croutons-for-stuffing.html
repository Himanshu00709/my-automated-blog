    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Set your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut the bread:</strong> Cut the gluten-free bread into small, bite-sized cubes. The size of the cubes will depend on your preference, but aim for uniformity to ensure even baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the bread:</strong> In a large bowl, toss the bread cubes with olive oil, garlic powder, dried herbs, salt, and black pepper. Make sure each cube is evenly coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Spread the seasoned bread cubes in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the croutons are golden brown and crispy. Be sure to stir the croutons halfway through baking to ensure even browning.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and store:</strong> Allow the croutons to cool completely before using them in your stuffing. Store any leftovers in an airtight container for up to a week.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Using Gluten-Free Croutons in Stuffing</h2>

    <p>Once you’ve made your gluten-free croutons, it’s time to incorporate them into your stuffing. Here are some tips to ensure your stuffing turns out perfectly:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Moisture Balance:</strong> Gluten-free bread can sometimes be drier than traditional bread, so be mindful of the moisture content in your stuffing. You may need to add a bit more broth or butter to achieve the desired consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavor Pairings:</strong> Consider the flavors of your croutons when choosing additional ingredients for your stuffing. For example, if your croutons are seasoned with rosemary and thyme, you might want to include complementary herbs and vegetables like sage, onions, and celery.</li>
        <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Gluten-free croutons can vary in texture depending on the type of bread used. If you prefer a softer stuffing, you can soak the croutons in broth for a few minutes before baking. For a crunchier stuffing, use the croutons as they are.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use store-bought gluten-free croutons for stuffing?</h3>
