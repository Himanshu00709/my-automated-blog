    <h2>Cooking Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Spaghetti</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free pasta can be a bit tricky, as it tends to have a different texture compared to traditional pasta. Here are some tips to ensure your Schar Gluten-Free Spaghetti turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Always cook your pasta in a large pot of boiling water. This prevents the pasta from sticking together and ensures even cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can be more delicate, so stirring frequently helps prevent clumping.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow the Package Instructions:</strong> Schar provides specific cooking times on their packaging. Be sure to follow these guidelines to achieve the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Test for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can go from perfectly cooked to overcooked quickly. Start testing the pasta a minute or two before the recommended cooking time.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Some people prefer to rinse their pasta after cooking, but this can remove the starch that helps sauces adhere. If you do rinse, do so lightly.</li>
    </ul>
