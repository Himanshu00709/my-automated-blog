    <h1>Gluten-Free Italian Salad Dressing: A Healthy and Flavorful Choice</h1>

    <p>Salad dressings are an essential part of any salad, adding flavor, moisture, and a touch of creativity to your greens. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a safe and delicious dressing can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free Italian salad dressing—a versatile, flavorful, and healthy option that caters to dietary restrictions without compromising on taste. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free Italian dressing, how to make it at home, and why it’s a must-have in your kitchen.</p>

    <h3>1. Safe for Gluten-Sensitive Individuals</h3>
