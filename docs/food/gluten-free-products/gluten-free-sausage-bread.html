    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon xanthan gum (if not included in your flour blend)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold and cubed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk (or dairy-free alternative)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 pound gluten-free sausage, cooked and crumbled</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheese (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder.</li>
        <li>Add the cold, cubed butter to the dry ingredients and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk and egg. Gradually add this mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it gently until it comes together. Roll the dough into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the cooked sausage and shredded cheese evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Carefully roll the dough into a log, starting from one of the longer sides. Pinch the seams to seal.</li>
        <li>Transfer the log to the prepared baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Allow the bread to cool slightly before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
