    <h1>Irish Oats: A Gluten-Free Superfood</h1>
    <p>Irish oats, also known as steel-cut oats, have been a staple in traditional Irish cuisine for centuries. Renowned for their hearty texture and nutty flavor, these oats are not only delicious but also packed with essential nutrients. In recent years, Irish oats have gained popularity among health-conscious individuals, particularly those following a gluten-free diet. But are Irish oats truly gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore the nutritional benefits of Irish oats, their gluten-free status, and how you can incorporate them into your diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Irish Oats?</h2>
    <p>Irish oats are made from whole oat groats that have been cut into two or three pieces using steel blades. This process gives them a coarse, chewy texture, which sets them apart from rolled oats or instant oats. Because they are less processed, Irish oats retain more of their natural nutrients, making them a healthier choice compared to other types of oats.</p>

    <h2>Are Irish Oats Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Oats are naturally gluten-free, but the issue of cross-contamination often arises during processing. Most oats are processed in facilities that also handle wheat, barley, and rye, which are gluten-containing grains. This can lead to trace amounts of gluten in the final product. However, certified gluten-free Irish oats are available, which are processed in dedicated gluten-free facilities to ensure they meet strict gluten-free standards.</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Certification</h3>
    <p>When shopping for Irish oats, look for products that are labeled "certified gluten-free." This certification ensures that the oats have been tested and contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe for most people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Irish Oats</h2>
    <p>Irish oats are a nutritional powerhouse, offering a wide range of health benefits. Here’s a breakdown of their key nutrients:</p>
