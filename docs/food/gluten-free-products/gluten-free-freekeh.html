    <h1>Gluten-Free Freekeh: A Nutritious Ancient Grain</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free alternatives has surged, driven by the growing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Among the many grains that have gained popularity, freekeh stands out as a nutritious and versatile option. But is freekeh truly gluten-free? In this article, we’ll explore the origins, nutritional benefits, and culinary uses of gluten-free freekeh, along with addressing common questions about this ancient grain.</p>

    <h2>What is Freekeh?</h2>
    <p>Freekeh, pronounced "free-kah," is an ancient grain that has been a staple in Middle Eastern cuisine for centuries.

The name "freekeh" comes from the Arabic word "farik," which means "rubbed" or "to rub," referring to the process of rubbing the grains to remove the chaff.</p>
    <p>While traditional freekeh is made from wheat, which contains gluten, there are now gluten-free versions available. These are typically made from grains like sorghum or millet, which are naturally gluten-free and provide a similar texture and flavor profile to traditional freekeh.</p>
