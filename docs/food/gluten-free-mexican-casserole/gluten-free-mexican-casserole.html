    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with olive oil to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked chicken or ground beef, black beans, corn kernels, and diced tomatoes. Mix well to ensure all ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Layer the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Begin by placing a layer of gluten-free tortillas at the bottom of the baking dish. Spread half of the filling mixture over the tortillas, followed by a layer of gluten-free enchilada sauce. Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded cheese on top. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of cheese on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. For a golden-brown top, broil the casserole for an additional 2-3 minutes, keeping a close eye to prevent burning.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the casserole is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with chopped cilantro and sliced avocado before serving. Enjoy your gluten-free Mexican casserole with a side of guacamole, salsa, or sour cream for an extra burst of flavor.</p>
