<h1>Gluten-Free Mayonnaise: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Mayonnaise is a staple in many kitchens, used in everything from sandwiches to salads. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free mayonnaise can be a challenge. In this article, we will explore what makes mayonnaise gluten-free, the benefits of choosing gluten-free options, and how to identify the best products on the market.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten-Free Mayonnaise?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free mayonnaise is a type of mayonnaise that does not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. Traditional mayonnaise is typically made from oil, egg yolks, vinegar, and seasonings. Since these ingredients are naturally gluten-free, most mayonnaise should be safe for those avoiding gluten. However, some brands may add gluten-containing additives or be processed in facilities that handle gluten, which can lead to cross-contamination.</p>

<p>It's important to read labels carefully and look for products that are certified gluten-free. This certification ensures that the product has been tested and meets strict gluten-free standards, typically containing less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Mayonnaise</h2>

<p>Choosing gluten-free mayonnaise can offer several benefits, especially for those with gluten-related disorders:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Safe for Celiac Disease:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including damage to the small intestine. Gluten-free mayonnaise ensures that they can enjoy their favorite condiment without risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduces Inflammation:</strong> Some people without celiac disease may still experience gluten sensitivity, which can cause inflammation and other symptoms. Gluten-free mayonnaise can help reduce these symptoms.</li>
    <li><strong>Wider Dietary Options:</strong> Gluten-free mayonnaise can be included in a variety of diets, including paleo, keto, and vegan (if egg-free), making it a versatile choice for many people.</li>
</ul>
