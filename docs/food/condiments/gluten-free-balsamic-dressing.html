<h1>Gluten-Free Balsamic Dressing: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by an increasing awareness of gluten-related health issues such as celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.

    <li><strong>Rich in Antioxidants:</strong> Balsamic vinegar is known for its high antioxidant content, which can help combat oxidative stress and inflammation in the body.</li>
    <li><strong>Low in Calories:</strong> Compared to creamy dressings, balsamic dressing is generally lower in calories, making it a healthier option for those watching their calorie intake.</li>
