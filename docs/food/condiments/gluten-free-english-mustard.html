<h1>Gluten-Free English Mustard: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>English mustard is a beloved condiment known for its sharp, tangy flavor and vibrant yellow color. Traditionally made from a blend of mustard seeds, vinegar, and spices, it has been a staple in British cuisine for centuries. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free version of this classic condiment can be a challenge. In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free English mustard, from its ingredients and benefits to how you can incorporate it into your diet.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten-Free English Mustard?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free English mustard is a variation of the traditional condiment that is made without any gluten-containing ingredients.

<p>Most gluten-free English mustards are made with the same basic ingredients as their traditional counterparts: mustard seeds, vinegar, water, salt, and spices. The key difference lies in the sourcing of these ingredients to ensure they are free from gluten contamination. Some brands may also use alternative thickeners or stabilizers to achieve the desired texture without relying on gluten.</p>
