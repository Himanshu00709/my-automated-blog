    <h1>Gluten-Free Russian Dressing: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Russian dressing is a classic condiment that has been a staple in American cuisine for decades. Known for its tangy, slightly sweet, and creamy flavor, it’s a versatile addition to salads, sandwiches, and even as a dipping sauce. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free version can be a challenge. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free Russian dressing, including its history, ingredients, and how to make your own at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Russian Dressing?</h2>

    <p>Russian dressing is a creamy, pinkish-orange condiment that originated in the United States in the early 20th century. Despite its name, it has no direct connection to Russian cuisine. The dressing is typically made with a base of mayonnaise and ketchup, combined with ingredients like horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, and spices. It’s most famously used in the Reuben sandwich, but it’s also a popular choice for salads and as a dip for vegetables.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free alternatives for their favorite foods, including condiments like Russian dressing.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients to Watch Out For</h2>

    <p>When it comes to Russian dressing, the primary concern for gluten-free eaters is the Worcestershire sauce. Traditional Worcestershire sauce contains malt vinegar, which is derived from barley and therefore contains gluten. Additionally, some brands of ketchup and mayonnaise may also contain hidden gluten in the form of additives or thickeners. Here’s a breakdown of common ingredients in Russian dressing and their gluten status:</p>
