    <h1>Gluten-Free Ssamjang: A Flavorful Korean Condiment</h1>
    <p>Korean cuisine is renowned for its bold flavors, and one of the most iconic condiments that embodies this is ssamjang. Traditionally, ssamjang is a thick, savory paste made from fermented soybean paste (doenjang), chili paste (gochujang), garlic, sesame oil, and other seasonings. It is commonly used as a dipping sauce for grilled meats, vegetables, and lettuce wraps. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional ssamjang can be problematic due to the presence of gluten in some of its ingredients. Enter gluten-free ssamjang—a delicious and safe alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this Korean staple.</p>

    <h2>What is Ssamjang?</h2>
    <p>Ssamjang, which translates to "wrapping sauce," is a versatile condiment that adds depth and umami to a variety of dishes. It is typically served alongside ssam (lettuce wraps) filled with grilled meat, rice, and other accompaniments. The combination of doenjang and gochujang creates a rich, complex flavor profile that is both spicy and savory, with a hint of sweetness.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and skin problems. Traditional ssamjang often contains gluten because some brands of doenjang and gochujang are made with wheat or barley as part of the fermentation process. By opting for gluten-free ssamjang, you can enjoy the same bold flavors without the adverse health effects.</p>
