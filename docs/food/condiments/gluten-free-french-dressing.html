<h1>Gluten-Free French Dressing: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>French dressing is a classic condiment that has been a staple in kitchens for decades. Its tangy, slightly sweet flavor makes it a versatile addition to salads, sandwiches, and even marinades. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free version can be a challenge.
