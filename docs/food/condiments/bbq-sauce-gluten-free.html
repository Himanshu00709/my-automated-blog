    <h1>Gluten-Free BBQ Sauce: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Barbecue sauce is a staple in many households, adding a tangy, sweet, or smoky flavor to a variety of dishes. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a safe and delicious BBQ sauce can be a challenge. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free BBQ sauce, including how to identify it, make it at home, and enjoy it without worry.</p>

    <h2>What Makes BBQ Sauce Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It’s commonly used as a thickening agent or flavor enhancer in many sauces and condiments. For BBQ sauce to be gluten-free, it must avoid these ingredients and any cross-contamination during production. Many commercial BBQ sauces are naturally gluten-free, but it’s essential to read labels carefully to ensure they meet gluten-free standards.</p>

    <h2>Key Ingredients in Gluten-Free BBQ Sauce</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free BBQ sauce typically includes the following ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tomato Base:</strong> Often made from tomato paste or ketchup, which are naturally gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweeteners:</strong> Such as brown sugar, honey, or molasses.</li>
        <li><strong>Vinegar:</strong> Adds tanginess and is usually gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices:</strong> Like paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder, which are naturally gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Thickeners:</strong> Instead of wheat-based thickeners, gluten-free BBQ sauces may use cornstarch or xanthan gum.</li>
