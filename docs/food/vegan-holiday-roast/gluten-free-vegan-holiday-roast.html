    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation Guide</h2>
    <p>Preparing a gluten-free vegan holiday roast may seem daunting, but with the right steps, it’s a straightforward process. Here’s how to do it:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by gathering all your ingredients. Chop the vegetables finely, cook the lentils or chickpeas, and prepare your binding agents (e.g., mix flaxseed meal with water to create a gel).</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked lentils or chickpeas with the chopped vegetables, herbs, spices, and binding agents. Mix thoroughly until the mixture is well combined and holds together when pressed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Roast</h3>
    <p>Transfer the mixture onto a piece of parchment paper or a clean surface. Shape it into a loaf or a round roast, depending on your preference. You can also wrap it in cheesecloth to help it hold its shape during cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Roast</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the shaped roast on a baking sheet or in a loaf pan, and bake for about 45-60 minutes, or until the outside is golden brown and the inside is firm.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Let It Rest</h3>
    <p>Once baked, let the roast rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing. This allows the flavors to meld and makes it easier to cut.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>A gluten-free vegan holiday roast pairs beautifully with a variety of side dishes. Consider serving it with roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh green salad. For a festive touch, drizzle it with a vegan gravy or cranberry sauce.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
