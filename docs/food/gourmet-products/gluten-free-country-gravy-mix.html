    <h1>Gluten-Free Country Gravy Mix: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Country gravy is a staple in many households, especially in the southern United States. It's a creamy, savory sauce that pairs perfectly with biscuits, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and more. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, traditional country gravy can be off-limits due to the wheat flour typically used as a thickening agent.

They are often fortified with spices such as black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to replicate the rich, savory flavor of traditional gravy.</p>

    <p>One of the key advantages of using a gluten-free gravy mix is its convenience. Instead of having to measure out and blend various gluten-free flours and spices, you can simply add water or milk to the mix and have a delicious gravy ready in minutes. This makes it an excellent option for busy households or for those who are new to gluten-free cooking.</p>

    <h2>How to Use Gluten-Free Country Gravy Mix</h2>

    <p>Using gluten-free country gravy mix is incredibly straightforward. Most mixes come with simple instructions that involve adding water or milk and heating the mixture on the stovetop. However, there are a few tips and tricks to ensure that your gravy turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Liquid:</strong> While water is the most common liquid used, substituting milk (dairy or non-dairy) can add extra creaminess and richness to your gravy.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk Constantly:</strong> To avoid lumps, whisk the mixture constantly as it heats. This helps to evenly distribute the thickeners and create a smooth texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Seasonings:</strong> Taste your gravy before serving and adjust the seasonings as needed. You may want to add extra black pepper, salt, or even a dash of hot sauce for added flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Immediately:</strong> Gluten-free gravy tends to thicken as it cools, so it's best served hot and fresh.</li>
