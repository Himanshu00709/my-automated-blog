    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Donut?</h2>
    <p>Creating a great gluten-free donut is no easy feat. The absence of gluten, which provides structure and elasticity to traditional donuts, means that bakers must rely on alternative ingredients and techniques. Here are some key factors that contribute to a delicious gluten-free donut:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour Blend:</strong> A combination of gluten-free flours such as rice flour, almond flour, and tapioca starch can mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Moisture:</strong> Gluten-free donuts can easily become dry, so bakers often add extra moisture through ingredients like applesauce, yogurt, or buttermilk.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> Gluten-free donuts should be just as flavorful as traditional ones. Bakers often use high-quality ingredients like vanilla bean, cocoa powder, and fresh fruit to enhance the taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Achieving the right texture is crucial. A good gluten-free donut should be light and fluffy, not dense or crumbly.</li>
    </ul>
