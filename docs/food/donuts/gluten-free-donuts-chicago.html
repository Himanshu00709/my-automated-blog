    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Donut?</h2>
    <p>A great gluten-free donut should be indistinguishable from a traditional donut in terms of taste, texture, and appearance. Achieving this requires careful selection of gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, coconut flour, or rice flour, and the use of binding agents like xanthan gum or psyllium husk. The best gluten-free donuts are moist, fluffy, and have a perfect balance of sweetness. Additionally, they should be free from cross-contamination, ensuring they are safe for those with celiac disease.</p>
