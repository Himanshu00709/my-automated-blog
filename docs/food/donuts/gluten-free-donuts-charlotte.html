    <h1>Gluten-Free Donuts in Charlotte: A Delicious Guide</h1>
    <p>Charlotte, North Carolina, is a city known for its vibrant food scene, and gluten-free options are no exception. For those with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or simply a preference for gluten-free foods, finding delicious and safe treats can be a challenge. Fortunately, Charlotte is home to several bakeries and cafes that specialize in gluten-free donuts.

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Donuts?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free donuts are more than just a trend; they are a necessity for many people. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause serious health issues for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Even for those without these conditions, reducing gluten intake can lead to improved digestion and overall health. Gluten-free donuts are made with alternative flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or rice flour, which not only make them safe for gluten-sensitive individuals but also add unique flavors and textures.</p>
