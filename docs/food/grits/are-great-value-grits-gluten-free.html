    <h1>Are Great Value Grits Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Grits, a staple in Southern cuisine, have gained popularity across the United States for their versatility and comforting texture. Whether served as a breakfast dish or a savory side, grits are a beloved food item. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, determining whether a product like Great Value Grits is gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free status of Great Value Grits, delve into their ingredients, and provide insights for those following a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Grits?</h2>

    <p>Grits are a type of porridge made from ground corn, specifically from a variety known as dent corn. The corn is treated with an alkali in a process called nixtamalization, which enhances its nutritional value and flavor. Grits can be prepared in various ways, including as a creamy breakfast dish or as a savory accompaniment to meats and vegetables. They are naturally gluten-free, as corn does not contain gluten. However, cross-contamination during processing or the addition of gluten-containing ingredients can affect their gluten-free status.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease, gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to various health complications. Others may have non-celiac gluten sensitivity, experiencing symptoms like bloating, fatigue, and headaches after consuming gluten. A gluten-free diet eliminates all sources of gluten, requiring careful scrutiny of food labels and ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Are Great Value Grits Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Great Value Grits, a product sold by Walmart, are marketed as a budget-friendly option for consumers. The primary ingredient in Great Value Grits is enriched white corn grits, which are naturally gluten-free. However, the gluten-free status of a product depends not only on its ingredients but also on the manufacturing process. Cross-contamination can occur if the product is processed in a facility that also handles gluten-containing grains.</p>

    <p>According to Walmart's product information and customer service, Great Value Grits are not certified gluten-free. This means that while the ingredients themselves do not contain gluten, there is a possibility of cross-contamination during production. For individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, this could pose a risk. It is always recommended to check the packaging for any gluten-free certifications or warnings about shared facilities.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Great Value Grits</h2>

    <p>To better understand the gluten-free status of Great Value Grits, let's take a closer look at their ingredients:</p>
