    <h1>Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Wedding Cake Near Me: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Planning a wedding is an exciting yet challenging endeavor, especially when it comes to catering to dietary restrictions. For couples or guests who are gluten-intolerant or lactose-intolerant, finding the perfect wedding cake can be a daunting task. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free and dairy-free baking has made it easier than ever to enjoy a delicious, allergen-friendly wedding cake.
