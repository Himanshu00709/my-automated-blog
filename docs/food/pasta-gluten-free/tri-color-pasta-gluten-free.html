    <h1>Tri-Color Gluten-Free Pasta: A Nutritious and Delicious Choice</h1>

    <p>Pasta is a beloved staple in many households, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional wheat-based pasta is off the menu. Enter tri-color gluten-free pasta—a vibrant, nutritious, and delicious alternative that caters to dietary restrictions without compromising on flavor or texture. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits, ingredients, and preparation methods of tri-color gluten-free pasta, along with some frequently asked questions to help you make the most of this versatile dish.</p>

    <h2>What is Tri-Color Gluten-Free Pasta?</h2>

    <p>Tri-color gluten-free pasta is a visually appealing and health-conscious alternative to traditional pasta. As the name suggests, it comes in three distinct colors—typically green, white, and red—which are derived from natural ingredients like spinach, beetroot, and rice flour. The gluten-free aspect ensures that it is safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, while the vibrant colors add a fun twist to your meals.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients and Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>Tri-color gluten-free pasta is typically made from a blend of gluten-free flours such as rice flour, corn flour, and quinoa flour. These ingredients not only make the pasta safe for those with gluten sensitivities but also provide a range of nutritional benefits. For instance, quinoa flour is rich in protein and essential amino acids, while rice flour is easily digestible and gentle on the stomach.</p>

    <p>The natural colorings used in tri-color pasta also contribute to its nutritional profile. Spinach, used for the green strands, is packed with iron, calcium, and vitamins A and C.
