<h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Gemelli Pasta</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free gemelli pasta requires a slightly different approach than traditional pasta to achieve the perfect texture. Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free gemelli turns out just right:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so use a large pot of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Stir the pasta occasionally during cooking to prevent clumping.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can go from perfectly cooked to overcooked quickly, so start checking for doneness a minute or two before the recommended cooking time on the package.</li>
    <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Unlike traditional pasta, gluten-free pasta benefits from a quick rinse after draining to remove excess starch. However, avoid rinsing if you plan to use a sauce that needs to cling to the pasta.</li>
</ol>
