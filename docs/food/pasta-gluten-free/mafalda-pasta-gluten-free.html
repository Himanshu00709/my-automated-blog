<h2>Cooking Tips for Gluten-Free Mafalda Pasta</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free Mafalda pasta requires a slightly different approach compared to traditional wheat-based pasta. Here are some tips to ensure the best results:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so use a large pot of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Stir the pasta occasionally during cooking to prevent clumping.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can go from perfectly cooked to overcooked quickly, so start checking for doneness a minute or two before the recommended cooking time.</li>
    <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Unlike wheat pasta, gluten-free pasta benefits from a quick rinse after draining to remove excess starch, but avoid over-rinsing to preserve the sauce's adherence.</li>
    <li><strong>Pair with the Right Sauce:</strong> Gluten-free Mafalda pasta pairs well with creamy sauces, pesto, or light olive oil-based sauces that complement its texture.</li>
