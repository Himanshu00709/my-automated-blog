    <h1>The Rise of Gluten-Free Bakeries: A Healthier Choice for Everyone</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and bakeries have been quick to adapt. Gluten-free bakeries are no longer a niche market; they are becoming a staple in communities worldwide. Whether you have celiac disease, a gluten intolerance, or simply want to explore healthier eating options, gluten-free bakeries offer a wide array of delicious and nutritious baked goods. This article delves into the world of gluten-free bakeries, exploring their benefits, popular products, and what to look for when choosing a gluten-free bakery.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause severe health issues. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Symptoms can range from digestive issues to fatigue, joint pain, and even neurological problems. Gluten sensitivity, while not as severe, can still cause discomfort and health issues. As awareness of these conditions has grown, so has the demand for gluten-free options.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free bakeries offer a safe haven for those who need to avoid gluten. Here are some of the key benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthier Options:</strong> Many gluten-free bakeries use alternative flours like almond, coconut, or rice flour, which can be more nutritious than traditional wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety:</strong> From bread and muffins to cookies and cakes, gluten-free bakeries offer a wide range of products that cater to different tastes and dietary needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Safe Environment:</strong> Dedicated gluten-free bakeries ensure there is no cross-contamination, making them a safe choice for those with celiac disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Innovative Recipes:</strong> Gluten-free baking often requires creativity, leading to unique and delicious recipes that you won't find in traditional bakeries.</li>
