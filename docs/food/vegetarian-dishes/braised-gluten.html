    <h2>How to Prepare Braised Gluten</h2>
    <p>Preparing braised gluten at home is a straightforward process that requires a few key ingredients and some patience. The basic steps involve making the gluten dough, washing it to remove the starch, and then braising it in a flavorful broth. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon five-spice powder</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1-inch piece of ginger, sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the wheat flour and water to form a dough. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it becomes elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a bowl of water and let it rest for 30 minutes. After resting, rinse the dough under cold water, kneading it gently to remove the starch. Continue rinsing until the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Once the starch is removed, you will be left with a ball of gluten. Cut the gluten into small pieces or strips.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, combine the vegetable broth, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, five-spice powder, garlic, and ginger. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the gluten pieces to the boiling broth, reduce the heat, and let it simmer for about 1 hour, or until the gluten is tender and has absorbed the flavors of the broth.</li>
        <li>Serve the braised gluten as a main dish or use it as a meat substitute in stir-fries, soups, or salads.</li>
    </ol>
