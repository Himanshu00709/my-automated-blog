<p>When it comes to grilling and smoking, Traeger is a name that stands out for its quality and innovation. Their rubs are a popular choice among BBQ enthusiasts, offering a variety of flavors to enhance your meats. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, the question of whether Traeger rubs are gluten-free is crucial. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to determine if Traeger rubs are safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s essential to scrutinize the ingredients and manufacturing processes of any food product, including BBQ rubs, to ensure they are gluten-free.</p>

<h2>Traeger Rubs: Ingredients and Gluten Content</h2>

<p>Traeger offers a wide range of rubs, each with a unique blend of spices and seasonings. To determine if these rubs are gluten-free, we need to examine their ingredients and any potential sources of gluten.</p>

<p>As seen in the table above, the primary ingredients in Traeger rubs are naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that cross-contamination can occur during manufacturing, which is why certifications and labeling are critical.</p>

<h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination</h2>

<p>Even if the ingredients in a product are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can introduce gluten. This is especially concerning for individuals with celiac disease, who must avoid even trace amounts of gluten. Traeger takes this issue seriously and has implemented measures to prevent cross-contamination in their facilities.</p>

<p>Traeger rubs are manufactured in facilities that adhere to strict gluten-free protocols. These facilities are regularly audited to ensure compliance with gluten-free standards. Additionally, Traeger rubs are labeled as gluten-free, providing an extra layer of assurance for consumers.</p>

<h2>Certifications and Labeling</h2>

<p>One of the most reliable ways to determine if a product is gluten-free is to look for certifications from recognized organizations. Traeger rubs are certified gluten-free by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO), which is one of the most stringent certification bodies in the industry. The GFCO requires products to contain less than 10 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is well below the FDA’s threshold of 20 ppm for gluten-free labeling.</p>

<p>In addition to GFCO certification, Traeger rubs are clearly labeled as gluten-free on their packaging. This labeling is a clear indication that the product has been tested and verified to meet gluten-free standards.</p>
