    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Flax Egg:</strong> In a small bowl, mix the ground flaxseed with water and let it sit for 5 minutes to thicken. This will act as a binder in place of eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Grate the Potatoes and Onion:</strong> Using a box grater or food processor, grate the potatoes and onion. Place the grated mixture in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much liquid as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the grated potatoes and onion with the chickpea flour, flax egg, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until everything is evenly combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong> In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Make sure the oil is hot but not smoking.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Latkes:</strong> Take a small handful of the potato mixture and form it into a patty. Carefully place it in the hot oil. Repeat with the remaining mixture, being careful not to overcrowd the pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Latkes:</strong> Cook the latkes for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Transfer the cooked latkes to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the latkes warm with your favorite toppings, such as applesauce, vegan sour cream, or a sprinkle of fresh herbs.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Vegan Latkes</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours such as almond flour, rice flour, or oat flour. However, chickpea flour works particularly well because it adds a nice texture and helps bind the latkes together.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I bake the latkes instead of frying them?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake the latkes for a healthier option. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and place the latkes on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush them lightly with oil and bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until they are golden and crispy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I store leftover latkes?</h3>
        <p>Leftover latkes can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 10-15 minutes, or until heated through and crispy.</p>
    </div>
