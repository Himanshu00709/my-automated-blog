    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk, and mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly between two bowls. Add pink food coloring to one bowl and blue food coloring to the other, mixing until the desired color is achieved.</li>
        <li>Pour the pink batter into one prepared pan and the blue batter into the other. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the cakes to cool completely before assembling. Place the pink layer on the bottom and the blue layer on top, then frost the entire cake with your favorite gluten-free frosting.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for a Successful Gluten-Free Gender Reveal Cake</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free gender reveal cake is a hit, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Reliable Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, such as those that include xanthan gum for elasticity.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Test the Cake for Doneness:</strong> Use a toothpick or cake tester to check if the cake is fully baked. It should come out clean or with a few crumbs attached.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Frosting:</strong> Ensure your frosting is also gluten-free. Many store-bought frostings are gluten-free, but always check the label.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice the Reveal:</strong> If you're planning a surprise reveal, practice cutting the cake to ensure the color inside is visible and vibrant.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Gender Reveal Cakes</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I make a gluten-free gender reveal cake ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake the cake layers a day or two in advance. Wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and store them in the refrigerator until you're ready to assemble and frost the cake.</p>

        <h3>2. What if I don't have buttermilk?</h3>
        <p>You can make a buttermilk substitute by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar to 1 cup of milk. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes before using.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I use natural food coloring?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Natural food coloring made from ingredients like beet juice (for pink) and spirulina (for blue) can be used, though the colors may be less vibrant than artificial options.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I ensure the cake is completely gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Check all your ingredients, including baking powder and food coloring, to ensure they are gluten-free. Cross-contamination can occur, so use clean utensils and baking pans.</p>
    </div>

With the right ingredients and a bit of creativity, you can create a stunning and delicious cake that everyone will enjoy.
