    <p>As you can see, the gluten-free crust is relatively low in calories and fat, making it a healthier option compared to some traditional pizza crusts. The ingredients used in the crust are also free from common allergens, such as soy and nuts, making it a safe choice for those with multiple food sensitivities.</p>

    <h2>How Does Giordano's Gluten-Free Pizza Compare to Traditional Pizza?</h2>

    <p>When it comes to taste and texture, Giordano's gluten-free pizza holds its own against their traditional deep-dish pizzas. The crust is slightly thinner and crispier, which some diners may prefer. The flavor profile is also slightly different, with the gluten-free crust offering a more neutral base that allows the toppings and sauce to shine. However, the overall experience is still very much in line with what you'd expect from a Giordano's pizza—rich, cheesy, and deeply satisfying.</p>

    <p>One area where the gluten-free pizza differs is in its size. Due to the nature of gluten-free dough, the pizza is typically smaller in diameter than the traditional deep-dish pizzas. However, this is a common trade-off when it comes to gluten-free options, and the smaller size is often offset by the richer, more concentrated flavors.</p>
