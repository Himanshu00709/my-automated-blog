    <h1>Johnny's Pizza: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>For pizza lovers with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a delicious and safe pizza option can be a challenge. Enter Johnny's Pizza, a brand that has made waves in the gluten-free community by offering a mouthwatering selection of gluten-free pizzas. In this article, we'll dive deep into what makes Johnny's Pizza a standout choice for gluten-free diners, exploring their ingredients, preparation methods, and the overall dining experience.</p>

    <h2>Why Johnny's Pizza Stands Out</h2>
    <p>Johnny's Pizza has earned a reputation for its commitment to quality and taste, especially in the gluten-free market. Unlike many other pizza chains that offer gluten-free options as an afterthought, Johnny's Pizza has made gluten-free a priority. Their gluten-free crust is made from a blend of high-quality, gluten-free flours, ensuring a texture and flavor that rivals traditional pizza crusts. Additionally, Johnny's Pizza takes extra precautions to avoid cross-contamination, making it a safe choice for those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>The Gluten-Free Crust: A Closer Look</h2>
    <p>At the heart of Johnny's Pizza's gluten-free offerings is their signature crust. Made from a blend of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch, this crust is designed to mimic the texture and taste of traditional pizza dough. The result is a crispy yet chewy crust that holds up well under a variety of toppings. The crust is also free from artificial preservatives and additives, making it a healthier option for those who are mindful of what they eat.</p>

    <h2>Toppings and Customization</h2>
    <p>One of the best things about Johnny's Pizza is the wide range of toppings available for their gluten-free pizzas. From classic options like pepperoni and mushrooms to more adventurous choices like artichoke hearts and sun-dried tomatoes, there's something for everyone. Customers can also customize their pizzas to suit their dietary needs, whether that means opting for a dairy-free cheese or loading up on veggies. The table below provides a quick overview of some popular topping combinations:</p>
