    <h2>What Makes Ghirardelli White Chocolate Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Ghirardelli White Chocolate is crafted with a meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that it meets the dietary needs of a wide range of consumers. The primary ingredients in Ghirardelli White Chocolate include sugar, cocoa butter, milk, soy lecithin, and natural flavors. None of these ingredients contain gluten, making the chocolate safe for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Ghirardelli White Chocolate</h2>
    <p>While white chocolate is often criticized for its high sugar content, Ghirardelli White Chocolate offers some nutritional benefits that are worth noting.
