    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure that your lasagna bakes evenly and comes out perfectly golden on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Gluten-Free Noodles</h3>
    <p>Cook the gluten-free lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Be sure not to overcook them, as they will continue to soften in the oven. Once cooked, drain and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Sauté the Spinach and Garlic</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant. Add the chopped spinach and cook until wilted, about 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
    <p>In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of gluten-free noodles over the sauce. Spread a layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, followed by a layer of shredded chicken, sautéed spinach, and a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of marinara sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Let It Rest</h3>
    <p>Once the lasagna is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before slicing. This will help the layers set and make it easier to serve.</p>
