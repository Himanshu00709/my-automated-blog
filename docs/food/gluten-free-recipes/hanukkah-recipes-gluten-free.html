    <h1>Gluten-Free Hanukkah Recipes: A Delicious Celebration</h1>
    <p>Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights, is a time for family, tradition, and of course, delicious food. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, celebrating Hanukkah doesn’t mean missing out on the festive flavors. With a little creativity and the right ingredients, you can enjoy all the traditional Hanukkah dishes without the gluten. In this blog post, we’ll explore some mouth-watering gluten-free Hanukkah recipes that will make your celebration both memorable and inclusive.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Hanukkah Recipes?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, many traditional Hanukkah dishes, such as latkes and sufganiyot, are typically made with wheat-based ingredients. By adapting these recipes to be gluten-free, everyone can partake in the joy of Hanukkah without compromising their health or dietary needs. Plus, gluten-free recipes often incorporate alternative flours and ingredients that can add unique flavors and textures to your dishes.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Latkes: A Hanukkah Staple</h2>
    <p>Latkes, or potato pancakes, are a quintessential Hanukkah dish. Traditionally made with grated potatoes, onions, and a binding agent like flour or matzo meal, latkes can easily be made gluten-free by substituting the flour with gluten-free alternatives such as almond flour, chickpea flour, or even gluten-free breadcrumbs.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>1 small onion, grated</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/4 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the grated potatoes and onion. Squeeze out any excess moisture using a clean kitchen towel.</li>
        <li>Add the beaten eggs, almond flour, salt, and pepper to the potato mixture. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture into the hot oil, flattening them slightly with the back of the spoon.</li>
        <li>Fry until golden brown on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and serve warm with applesauce or sour cream.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Sufganiyot: A Sweet Treat</h2>
    <p>Sufganiyot, or jelly-filled doughnuts, are another Hanukkah favorite. These sweet treats are typically made with wheat flour, but with a few adjustments, you can create a gluten-free version that’s just as delicious. Using a combination of gluten-free flours and xanthan gum can help achieve the right texture for the dough.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 packet active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp xanthan gum</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
        <li>Jam or jelly for filling</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm milk and let it sit for 5 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, sugar, and xanthan gum. Add the yeast mixture, eggs, and melted butter. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface and cut into small circles. Let the circles rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350°F (175°C). Fry the doughnuts until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, fill the doughnuts with jam using a piping bag. Dust with powdered sugar before serving.</li>
    </ol>
