    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making ricotta gluten-free pancakes is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create a delicious breakfast:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Batter:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the ricotta cheese, eggs, milk, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Pan:</strong> Preheat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease the surface with butter or oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Pancakes:</strong> Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, then flip and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as fresh fruit, maple syrup, or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
