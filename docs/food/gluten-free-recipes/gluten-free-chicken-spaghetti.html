    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Gluten-Free Spaghetti</h3>
    <p>Begin by cooking the gluten-free spaghetti according to the package instructions. Be sure not to overcook it, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy if left in boiling water for too long. Once cooked, drain the pasta and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, and minced garlic, and sauté until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the gluten-free cream of chicken soup and diced tomatoes, mixing well to combine. Allow the sauce to simmer for a few minutes, then add the shredded chicken and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Pasta and Sauce</h3>
    <p>Add the cooked gluten-free spaghetti to the skillet, tossing it with the sauce until the pasta is evenly coated. If the mixture seems too thick, you can add a splash of chicken broth or milk to achieve your desired consistency.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Cheese and Bake</h3>
    <p>Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish and sprinkle the shredded cheddar cheese on top. Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the dish from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh parsley or chopped green onions for an extra touch of flavor.</p>
