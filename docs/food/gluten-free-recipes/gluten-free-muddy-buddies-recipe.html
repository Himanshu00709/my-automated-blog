    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the recipe:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cereal</h3>
    <p>Measure out 6 cups of gluten-free rice cereal and place it in a large mixing bowl. Make sure the bowl is big enough to allow room for stirring later on.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Melt the Chocolate Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate chips, peanut butter, and unsalted butter. Microwave the mixture in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until the mixture is smooth and fully melted. Be careful not to overheat, as chocolate can burn easily.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Cereal and Chocolate</h3>
    <p>Pour the melted chocolate mixture over the cereal in the large mixing bowl. Gently stir until all the cereal is evenly coated with the chocolate mixture. This step is crucial to ensure that every bite is packed with flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Powdered Sugar</h3>
    <p>Transfer the coated cereal into a large resealable plastic bag or a container with a lid. Add the powdered sugar, seal the bag or container, and shake vigorously until the cereal is fully coated with the powdered sugar. This will give your muddy buddies their signature sweet and powdery finish.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Let It Set</h3>
    <p>Spread the coated cereal out on a baking sheet or a large piece of parchment paper. Allow it to cool and set for about 15-20 minutes. Once set, your gluten-free muddy buddies are ready to be enjoyed!</p>
