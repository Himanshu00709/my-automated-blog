    <h1>Gluten-Free Barbecue Recipes: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Barbecue season is a time for gathering with friends and family, enjoying the outdoors, and indulging in delicious grilled foods. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding safe and tasty barbecue options can be a challenge. This guide will provide you with a variety of gluten-free barbecue recipes, tips for avoiding cross-contamination, and answers to frequently asked questions about gluten-free grilling.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Barbecue?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause serious health issues for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Traditional barbecue sauces, marinades, and even some meats can contain hidden gluten. By opting for gluten-free barbecue recipes, you can enjoy all the flavors of a classic barbecue without the worry of gluten exposure.</p>

    <h2>Essential Gluten-Free Barbecue Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Before diving into the recipes, it's important to stock your kitchen with gluten-free essentials. Here are some key ingredients to have on hand:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Soy Sauce or Tamari:</strong> A great substitute for regular soy sauce, which often contains wheat.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free BBQ Sauce:</strong> Many store-bought BBQ sauces contain gluten, so look for certified gluten-free options or make your own.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Flour:</strong> Useful for making rubs or coatings for meats.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh Herbs and Spices:</strong> These are naturally gluten-free and can add incredible flavor to your dishes.</li>
    </ul>
