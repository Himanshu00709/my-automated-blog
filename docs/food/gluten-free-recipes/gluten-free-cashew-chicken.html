    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Start by cutting the chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces. In a bowl, combine the chicken with 1 tablespoon of gluten-free soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. Mix well to ensure the chicken is evenly coated. Let it marinate for at least 15 minutes to absorb the flavors.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken and cook until it’s golden brown and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add the remaining olive oil. Sauté the minced garlic and ginger until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the sliced bell peppers and cook for another 2-3 minutes until they start to soften. In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining gluten-free soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, and sesame oil. Pour this mixture into the skillet and stir to combine.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine and Serve</h3>
    <p>Return the cooked chicken to the skillet and add the cashews. Stir everything together and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens and the cashews are lightly toasted. Garnish with chopped green onions and serve over steamed rice or quinoa for a complete meal.</p>
