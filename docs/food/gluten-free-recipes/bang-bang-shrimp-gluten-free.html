<p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free Bang Bang Shrimp turns out perfectly every time:</p>

<ul>

    <li><strong>Double Coat for Extra Crispiness:</strong> For an extra crispy coating, you can double coat the shrimp by dipping them in the egg mixture and flour mixture twice.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overcrowd the Fryer:</strong> Fry the shrimp in small batches to ensure they cook evenly and stay crispy.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust the Spice Level:</strong> If you prefer a milder sauce, reduce the amount of Sriracha. For more heat, add an extra teaspoon or two.</li>
</ul>
