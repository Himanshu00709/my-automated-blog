<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly and achieve the perfect texture.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free rolled oats, gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

<h3>3. Cream the Butter and Sugars</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened unsalted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

<h3>4. Add the Egg and Vanilla</h3>
<p>Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined. The mixture should be smooth and slightly creamy.</p>

<h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough cookies.</p>

<h3>6. Fold in the Raisins</h3>
<p>Gently fold in the raisins until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</p>

<h3>7. Scoop and Bake</h3>
<p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Space them about 2 inches apart to allow for spreading. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</p>

<h3>8. Cool and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free oatmeal raisin cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Oatmeal Raisin Cookies</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Certified Gluten-Free Oats:</strong> Ensure that the oats you use are certified gluten-free to avoid any cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cookies. Mix until just combined for the best texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If you have time, chilling the dough for 30 minutes before baking can help the cookies hold their shape better.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to add nuts, chocolate chips, or other dried fruits to customize your cookies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use quick oats instead of rolled oats?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use quick oats, but the texture of the cookies will be slightly different. Rolled oats provide a chewier texture, while quick oats will make the cookies softer.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make these cookies vegan by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of a regular egg.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
    <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the dough or baked cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but the texture and flavor may vary slightly. Almond flour or coconut flour can also be used, but you may need to adjust the quantities.</p>
