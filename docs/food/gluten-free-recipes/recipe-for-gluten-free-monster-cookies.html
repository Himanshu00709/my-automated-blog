<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent the cookies from sticking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free oats, gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugars</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, peanut butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
<p>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract until everything is well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough cookies.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Fold in Chocolate Chips and M&M's</h3>
<p>Gently fold in the chocolate chips and M&M's until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Scoop and Bake</h3>
<p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden but the centers are still soft.</p>

<h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your gluten-free monster cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use regular oats instead of gluten-free oats?</h3>
    <p>No, regular oats are often cross-contaminated with gluten during processing. To ensure your cookies are truly gluten-free, it's important to use certified gluten-free oats.</p>

    <h3>Can I substitute the peanut butter with another nut butter?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use almond butter, cashew butter, or any other nut butter as a substitute for peanut butter. Just make sure it's gluten-free if you're avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
    <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the dough or baked cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make these cookies vegan by using a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of regular eggs and using vegan butter and chocolate chips.</p>
