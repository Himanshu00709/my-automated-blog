    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Carrots</h3>
    <p>Start by peeling and chopping the carrots into small pieces. Steam or boil the carrots until they are tender. Once cooked, drain the carrots and allow them to cool slightly before blending.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Blend the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a food processor or blender, combine the cooked carrots, eggs, melted butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt. Blend until the mixture is smooth and well combined. Add the gluten-free flour and baking powder, and blend again until the batter is uniform.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Soufflé</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a soufflé dish or a similar baking dish with butter or a gluten-free cooking spray. Pour the carrot mixture into the prepared dish and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the soufflé is set and the top is golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the soufflé to cool for a few minutes before serving. It can be enjoyed as a side dish or a dessert, depending on your preference. For an extra touch, you can dust the top with powdered sugar or serve it with a dollop of whipped cream.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Carrot Soufflé</h2>
    <p>Carrot soufflé is not only delicious but also offers several nutritional benefits. Carrots are an excellent source of beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A. This vitamin is essential for good vision, a healthy immune system, and skin health. Additionally, carrots are high in fiber, which aids in digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut. The eggs in the recipe provide a good source of protein, while the gluten-free flour ensures that the dish is safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Carrot Soufflé</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a vegan version of this recipe by substituting the eggs with a flaxseed or chia seed egg and using a plant-based butter. The texture may vary slightly, but it will still be delicious.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can use any gluten-free flour of your choice, such as almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Just be sure to adjust the quantity if necessary, as different flours have different absorption rates.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftover carrot soufflé can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply place it in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10-15 minutes, or until warmed through.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the soufflé?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the soufflé for up to 2 months. Allow it to cool completely, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before placing it in the freezer. To reheat, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and then bake it in the oven until heated through.</p>
