<h1>Gluten-Free Passover Recipes: A Guide to Delicious and Traditional Meals</h1>

<p>Passover is a time for reflection, family gatherings, and, of course, delicious food. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, the holiday can present unique challenges, especially when it comes to traditional recipes that often rely on wheat-based ingredients like matzo. However, with a little creativity and the right ingredients, you can enjoy a gluten-free Passover that is both delicious and true to tradition. In this guide, we’ll explore some of the best gluten-free Passover recipes, from appetizers to desserts, ensuring that everyone at your table can partake in the festivities.</p>

<h2>Why Gluten-Free Passover?</h2>

<p>Passover is a Jewish holiday that commemorates the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. During this time, it is customary to avoid leavened bread and other products made with wheat, barley, rye, and oats. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, this restriction aligns naturally with their dietary needs. However, many traditional Passover foods, such as matzo and matzo meal, contain gluten. This makes it essential to find gluten-free alternatives that still honor the spirit of the holiday.</p>
