    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your cobbler will bake evenly and develop a golden-brown crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Fruit Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, combine your chosen fruit with sugar and cornstarch (if using). The sugar will sweeten the fruit, while the cornstarch will help thicken the juices as the cobbler bakes. Mix well and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
    <p>In another bowl, mix the Bisquick gluten-free baking mix with milk and melted butter. Stir until the mixture is smooth and well combined. The batter should be thick but pourable.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Cobbler</h3>
    <p>Pour the fruit mixture into a greased baking dish. Then, spoon the Bisquick batter over the top of the fruit, spreading it evenly. Don't worry if the batter doesn't cover every inch—it will spread as it bakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling. Let the cobbler cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Bisquick Gluten-Free Cobbler</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Fruit:</strong> While berries, peaches, and apples are popular choices, you can use almost any fruit you like. Just make sure to adjust the sugar and cornstarch accordingly.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, or vanilla extract to the fruit mixture for extra flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a tough topping. Stir just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Warm:</strong> Cobbler is best enjoyed warm, preferably with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh fruit instead of frozen?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh fruit. Just make sure to adjust the sugar and cornstarch as needed, as fresh fruit may release more or less juice than frozen fruit.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cobbler dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the milk and butter with your favorite non-dairy alternatives, such as almond milk and vegan butter.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the cobbler?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cobbler before or after baking. If freezing before baking, assemble the cobbler in a freezer-safe dish and freeze. When ready to bake, let it thaw in the refrigerator overnight and then bake as directed. If freezing after baking, let the cobbler cool completely, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing.</p>
