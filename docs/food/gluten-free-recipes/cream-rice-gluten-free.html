    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Cream Rice</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free cream rice at home is simple and requires just a few basic ingredients. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating this delicious dish:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of gluten-free rice (such as Arborio or Jasmine rice)</li>
        <li>4 cups of milk (dairy or non-dairy alternatives like almond or coconut milk)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon (optional)</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming too sticky.</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the rinsed rice, milk, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Stir well to combine.</li>
        <li>Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle boil, stirring occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Once the mixture comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer. Continue to stir occasionally, allowing the rice to absorb the milk and become creamy.</li>
        <li>After about 20-25 minutes, the rice should be tender, and the mixture should have thickened. Stir in the vanilla extract and ground cinnamon (if using).</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the cream rice cool slightly before serving. You can enjoy it warm or chilled, depending on your preference.</li>
    </ol>
