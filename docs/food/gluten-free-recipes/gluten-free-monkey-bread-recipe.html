<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, xanthan gum, granulated sugar, and salt. In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm milk and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy. Add the melted butter and eggs to the yeast mixture, then pour this into the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms. The dough will be sticky, but that’s normal for gluten-free dough.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Let the Dough Rise</h3>

<p>Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. The dough should double in size. If your kitchen is cool, you can place the bowl in a slightly warmed oven (turned off) to help the dough rise.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Prepare the Cinnamon Sugar Coating</h3>

<p>While the dough is rising, prepare the cinnamon sugar coating. In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar and ground cinnamon. Melt the additional butter in a separate bowl. Once the dough has risen, pinch off small pieces and roll them into balls about 1 inch in diameter.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Assemble the Monkey Bread</h3>

<p>Dip each dough ball into the melted butter, then roll it in the cinnamon sugar mixture. Place the coated balls into a greased bundt pan, layering them evenly. Once all the dough balls are in the pan, drizzle any remaining butter and cinnamon sugar over the top.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the monkey bread for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the bread is cooked through. Let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then invert it onto a serving plate. Serve warm and enjoy!</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right combination of flours and starches to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t skip the xanthan gum:</strong> Xanthan gum is essential in gluten-free baking as it helps bind the dough together and gives it elasticity. Without it, your dough may be crumbly and difficult to work with.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the dough rise properly:</strong> Gluten-free dough may take a bit longer to rise than traditional dough, so be patient. A warm environment will help speed up the process.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve warm:</strong> Monkey bread is best enjoyed fresh out of the oven when it’s still warm and gooey. If you have leftovers, you can reheat them in the microwave for a few seconds to restore that fresh-baked texture.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can easily make this recipe dairy-free by using a non-dairy milk (such as almond or oat milk) and a dairy-free butter substitute. Just make sure to check the labels to ensure they’re gluten-free as well.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a different type of sugar?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can use coconut sugar, maple sugar, or even a sugar substitute like erythritol if you prefer. Keep in mind that the flavor and texture may vary slightly depending on the type of sugar you use.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftover monkey bread?</h3>
    <p>Leftover monkey bread can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough the night before and let it rise in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning, let it come to room temperature before assembling and baking. This is a great option for holiday mornings or special occasions.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free monkey bread is a delightful treat that brings the joy of baking to those who follow a gluten-free diet. With the right ingredients and a little patience, you can create a dessert that’s just as delicious and satisfying as the traditional version. Whether you’re serving it for breakfast, brunch, or dessert, this recipe is sure to be a hit with family and friends.
