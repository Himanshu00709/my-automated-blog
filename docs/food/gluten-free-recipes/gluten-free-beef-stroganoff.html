    <h1>Gluten-Free Beef Stroganoff: A Delicious and Healthy Twist</h1>
    <p>Beef stroganoff is a classic comfort food that has been enjoyed for generations. Traditionally, this dish is made with beef, mushrooms, and a creamy sauce served over egg noodles. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, the traditional recipe can be off-limits due to the use of flour as a thickening agent and the presence of gluten in egg noodles. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can create a gluten-free version of beef stroganoff that is just as delicious and satisfying as the original.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Adopting a gluten-free diet can help alleviate these symptoms and improve overall health. Even for those without gluten sensitivity, reducing gluten intake can sometimes lead to better digestion and increased energy levels.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Beef Stroganoff</h2>
    <p>To make a gluten-free beef stroganoff, you'll need to replace the traditional flour and egg noodles with gluten-free alternatives. Here's a list of ingredients you'll need:</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the cooking process. Follow these steps to create a mouthwatering gluten-free beef stroganoff:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Beef</h3>
    <p>Start by cutting the beef into thin strips. Season the beef with salt and pepper, then lightly coat it with gluten-free flour. This will help thicken the sauce later on. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil or butter. Sear the beef strips until they are browned on all sides, then remove them from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of olive oil or butter. Sauté the chopped onion and minced garlic until they become translucent and fragrant. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook until they are tender and have released their moisture. This step is crucial for building the flavor base of your stroganoff.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Create the Sauce</h3>
    <p>Once the vegetables are cooked, sprinkle the remaining gluten-free flour over them and stir to combine. Gradually pour in the beef broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it thicken. This is where the magic happens—the sauce will start to take on a rich, velvety texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine and Simmer</h3>
    <p>Return the seared beef strips to the skillet and stir them into the sauce. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. If you're using Dijon mustard, now is the time to stir it in for an extra layer of flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Sour Cream</h3>
    <p>Just before serving, remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the sour cream. This will give the stroganoff its signature creamy texture. Be sure not to boil the sauce after adding the sour cream, as it can curdle.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve your gluten-free beef stroganoff over a bed of gluten-free pasta or rice. Garnish with fresh parsley or chives if desired, and enjoy your delicious, gluten-free meal!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Beef Stroganoff</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the beef with chicken, turkey, or even tofu for a vegetarian option. Just adjust the cooking time accordingly.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of sour cream?</h3>
        <p>If you're lactose intolerant or prefer a dairy-free option, you can use coconut cream or a dairy-free sour cream alternative.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop, adding a splash of beef broth if the sauce has thickened too much.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free beef stroganoff?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the stroganoff for up to 3 months. However, it's best to freeze it without the sour cream. Add the sour cream after thawing and reheating.</p>
