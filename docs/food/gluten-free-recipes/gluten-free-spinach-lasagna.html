    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Spinach</h3>
    <p>Start by washing the spinach thoroughly to remove any dirt or grit. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Sauté the minced garlic until fragrant, then add the spinach. Cook until the spinach is wilted, about 3-4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Gluten-Free Lasagna Noodles</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the gluten-free lasagna noodles according to the package instructions, usually about 8-10 minutes. Be careful not to overcook, as gluten-free noodles can become mushy. Drain and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread a layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, followed by a layer of sautéed spinach. Sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of tomato sauce and cheese on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Lasagna</h3>
    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown. Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Spinach Lasagna</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free spinach lasagna is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Spinach is a powerhouse of vitamins and minerals, while the ricotta and mozzarella cheeses provide a good source of protein and calcium. Gluten-free noodles, made from ingredients like rice or quinoa, are easier to digest for those with gluten sensitivities. Here’s a breakdown of the nutritional content per serving:</p>
