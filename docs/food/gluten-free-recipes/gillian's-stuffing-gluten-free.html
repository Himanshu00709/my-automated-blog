    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the bread:</strong> Spread the gluten-free bread cubes on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven for about 10-15 minutes, or until they are lightly golden and dry. Remove from the oven and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the vegetables:</strong> In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion, celery, and garlic, and sauté until the vegetables are soft and fragrant, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the herbs:</strong> Stir in the fresh sage and thyme, and cook for another 1-2 minutes to release their flavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the toasted bread cubes with the sautéed vegetable mixture. Gradually add the chicken or vegetable broth, stirring gently to ensure the bread absorbs the liquid evenly. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the stuffing:</strong> Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish and cover with foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the top is golden and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and enjoy:</strong> Allow the stuffing to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy it as a side dish with your favorite holiday meals!</li>

    <h2>FAQs About Gillian's Gluten-Free Stuffing</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I make Gillian's Gluten-Free Stuffing ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the stuffing up to a day in advance. Simply assemble the ingredients and store them in the refrigerator until you're ready to bake. You may need to add a little extra broth before baking if the bread has absorbed too much moisture.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I freeze Gillian's Gluten-Free Stuffing?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Gillian's Gluten-Free Stuffing freezes well. After baking, allow the stuffing to cool completely, then transfer it to an airtight container or freezer bag.

        <h3>3. Can I use store-bought gluten-free bread for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use store-bought gluten-free bread. However, make sure to choose a high-quality brand that you enjoy, as the flavor and texture of the bread will significantly impact the final dish.</p>

        <h3>4. Are there any substitutions for the herbs?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have fresh sage or thyme on hand, you can use dried herbs instead. Keep in mind that dried herbs are more concentrated in flavor, so you'll need to use less—about 1 teaspoon of dried sage and 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme.</p>
