They are also packed with essential vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, potassium, and various antioxidants.</p>

<p>Incorporating apples into your diet can help lower cholesterol levels, reduce the risk of heart disease, and even support weight loss. The natural sweetness of apples also means you can reduce the amount of added sugar in your recipes, making these pancakes a healthier option overall.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Batter:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. In a separate bowl, combine the almond milk, egg, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Fold in the grated apple.</li>
    <li><strong>Heat the Pan:</strong> Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with coconut oil.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the Pancakes:</strong> Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as additional maple syrup, fresh apple slices, or a dollop of yogurt.</li>
