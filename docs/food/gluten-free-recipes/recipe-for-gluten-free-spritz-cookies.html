            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>As needed</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step instructions for making gluten-free spritz cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly and achieve the perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer. Add the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract, and mix until well combined. Gradually add the gluten-free flour blend and salt, mixing until the dough comes together. If you’re using food coloring, add it at this stage and mix until the desired color is achieved.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Fill a cookie press with the dough and press the cookies onto ungreased baking sheets. If you don’t have a cookie press, you can use a piping bag with a star tip to create similar shapes. Space the cookies about 1 inch apart to allow for spreading during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Keep a close eye on them, as gluten-free cookies can brown quickly. Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Decorate (Optional)</h3>
    <p>Once the cookies have cooled, you can decorate them with sprinkles, icing, or any other decorations you like. This step is optional but adds a festive touch to your cookies.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free spritz cookies can be a bit tricky, but these tips will help you achieve the best results:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking and contains xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough if necessary:</strong> If the dough is too soft to work with, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before shaping the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> While vanilla and almond extracts are classic choices, you can experiment with other flavors like lemon, orange, or even peppermint for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor of the cookies may vary. A blend of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch often works well.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine. Just make sure it’s softened to room temperature before using.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. You can also freeze them for longer storage.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a cookie cutter instead of a cookie press?</h3>
        <p>While a cookie press is ideal for spritz cookies, you can use a cookie cutter if you prefer. Just roll out the dough and cut out shapes before baking.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="conclusion">
        <p>Gluten-free spritz cookies are a delightful treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and techniques, you can create cookies that are just as delicious and festive as the traditional version.
