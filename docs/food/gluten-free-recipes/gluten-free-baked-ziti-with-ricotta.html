    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your baked ziti will cook evenly and develop a golden, bubbly top.</p>

    <h3>2. Cook the Gluten-Free Pasta</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gluten-free ziti pasta and cook according to the package instructions, usually about 8-10 minutes. Be careful not to overcook the pasta, as it will continue to cook in the oven. Drain the pasta and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Ricotta Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, half of the shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, minced garlic, chopped basil, and the egg. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Baked Ziti</h3>
    <p>In a large baking dish, spread a thin layer of marinara sauce to prevent the pasta from sticking. Add the cooked ziti pasta to the ricotta mixture and toss to coat evenly. Transfer the pasta mixture to the baking dish, spreading it out in an even layer. Pour the remaining marinara sauce over the top and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the top is golden brown. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Baked Ziti</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Pasta:</strong> Not all gluten-free pastas are created equal. Look for brands that use a blend of rice, corn, and quinoa for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook the Pasta:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can become mushy if overcooked. Aim for al dente when boiling.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh basil and high-quality marinara sauce can elevate the flavor of your dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Let It Rest:</strong> Allow the baked ziti to cool for 5-10 minutes before serving. This helps the flavors meld together and makes it easier to slice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan are traditional choices, you can experiment with other cheeses like fontina, provolone, or even a dairy-free alternative if you’re lactose intolerant.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can assemble the baked ziti up to a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. When you’re ready to bake, simply remove it from the fridge, let it come to room temperature, and bake as directed.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for freezing?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free baked ziti freezes well. After baking, let it cool completely, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil. It can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and bake at 350°F (175°C) until heated through.</p>

        <h3>Can I add meat to this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Certainly! Ground beef, Italian sausage, or even shredded chicken can be added to the marinara sauce for a heartier dish. Just make sure to cook the meat thoroughly before mixing it with the sauce.</p>
