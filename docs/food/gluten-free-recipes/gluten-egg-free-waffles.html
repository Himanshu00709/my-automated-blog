    <h1>Gluten-Free and Egg-Free Waffles: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>Waffles are a beloved breakfast staple, but for those with dietary restrictions, enjoying this classic dish can be a challenge. Whether you're avoiding gluten due to celiac disease or a gluten sensitivity, or you're allergic to eggs, you don't have to miss out on the joy of waffles.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to make your own gluten-free and egg-free waffles:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Flax Egg:</strong> In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of flaxseed meal with 3 tablespoons of water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it thickens.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, mix the almond milk, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and melted coconut oil. Add the prepared flax egg and mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Waffle Iron:</strong> Preheat your waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Waffles:</strong> Pour the batter onto the preheated waffle iron and cook until golden brown and crisp. Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the waffles warm with your favorite toppings, such as fresh fruit, maple syrup, or dairy-free whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free and Egg-Free Waffles</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free and egg-free waffles can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of flours like rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense waffles. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Batter Rest:</strong> Allowing the batter to rest for 5-10 minutes before cooking can help the flours absorb the liquid, resulting in a better texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Non-Stick Waffle Iron:</strong> Gluten-free waffles can be more delicate, so using a non-stick waffle iron will help prevent sticking and ensure easy removal.</li>
    </ul>
