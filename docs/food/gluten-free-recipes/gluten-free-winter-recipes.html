    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free in Winter?</h2>

However, with the rise of gluten-free alternatives, it's easier than ever to enjoy your favorite winter dishes without compromising your health. Gluten-free diets can help reduce inflammation, improve digestion, and boost energy levels, making them an excellent choice for the colder months when your body needs extra support.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Winter Recipe Ideas</h2>

    <h3>1. Hearty Gluten-Free Soups</h3>

    <p>Soups are a winter staple, and they can easily be made gluten-free without sacrificing flavor.

Here’s a simple recipe for a gluten-free chicken and vegetable soup:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Quantity</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Chicken breast</td>
                <td>2 cups, cooked and shredded</td>
            </tr>
