    <h1>Gluten-Free Kung Pao Chicken: A Flavorful and Healthy Twist</h1>
    <p>Kung Pao Chicken is a classic Chinese dish known for its bold flavors, combining spicy, sweet, and savory elements.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create a delicious gluten-free Kung Pao Chicken:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Cut the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces and set aside. In a small bowl, mix the gluten-free soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, and sesame oil. This will be your marinade. Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and let them sit for at least 15 minutes to absorb the flavors.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Aromatics</h3>
    <p>Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil and sauté the minced garlic and ginger until fragrant. Be careful not to burn them, as this can result in a bitter taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Add the marinated chicken to the skillet and cook until it’s no longer pink, about 5-7 minutes. Make sure to stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Incorporate the Chilies and Peanuts</h3>
    <p>Add the dried red chilies and roasted peanuts to the skillet. Stir well to combine. The chilies will infuse the dish with a spicy kick, while the peanuts add a satisfying crunch.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Thicken the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with water to create a slurry. Pour this into the skillet and stir continuously until the sauce thickens. This should take about 2-3 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Finally, add the chopped green onions and give the dish a final stir. Serve your gluten-free Kung Pao Chicken over steamed rice or quinoa for a complete meal.</p>

    <p>This gluten-free version of Kung Pao Chicken not only caters to those with dietary restrictions but also offers several health benefits:</p>

        <li><strong>High in Protein:</strong> Chicken breast is an excellent source of lean protein, which is essential for muscle repair and growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich in Healthy Fats:</strong> Sesame oil and peanuts provide healthy fats that support heart health.</li>

        <h3>Can I use tofu instead of chicken?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily substitute chicken with tofu to make a vegetarian version of this dish. Make sure to use firm tofu and press it to remove excess moisture before cooking.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
