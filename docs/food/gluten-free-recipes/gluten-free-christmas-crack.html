    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making Gluten-Free Christmas Crack is surprisingly simple, and the results are incredibly rewarding. Follow these steps to create your own batch:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Arrange the Crackers</h3>
    <p>Arrange the gluten-free crackers in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Make sure they are close together but not overlapping.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Caramel</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the brown sugar and stir continuously until the mixture comes to a boil. Let it boil for 3 minutes without stirring. The mixture should thicken and become a rich caramel color.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Pour the Caramel Over the Crackers</h3>
    <p>Carefully pour the caramel mixture over the arranged crackers, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Make sure all the crackers are covered.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 5 minutes. The caramel will bubble and spread further over the crackers.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Add the Chocolate</h3>
    <p>Remove the baking sheet from the oven and immediately sprinkle the chocolate chips over the hot caramel. Let the chocolate sit for a few minutes to melt, then spread it evenly with a spatula.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Add Toppings</h3>
    <p>While the chocolate is still soft, add your desired toppings. This could be chopped nuts, festive sprinkles, or crushed candy canes.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Break into Pieces</h3>
    <p>Allow the Christmas Crack to cool completely at room temperature. Once cooled, break it into pieces and serve. Store any leftovers in an airtight container.</p>
