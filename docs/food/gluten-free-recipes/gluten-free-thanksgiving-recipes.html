    <h1>Gluten-Free Thanksgiving Recipes: A Delicious and Inclusive Feast</h1>
    <p>Thanksgiving is a time for gratitude, family, and, of course, food. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, navigating the traditional Thanksgiving spread can be a challenge. The good news is that with a little creativity and planning, you can enjoy a gluten-free Thanksgiving feast that is just as delicious and satisfying as the traditional one. In this blog post, we’ll explore a variety of gluten-free Thanksgiving recipes that will make your holiday meal both inclusive and memorable.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free for Thanksgiving?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues for these individuals, including digestive problems, fatigue, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Even if you don’t have a gluten intolerance, incorporating gluten-free options into your Thanksgiving meal can make the holiday more inclusive for guests who do. Plus, gluten-free recipes often use whole, unprocessed ingredients, which can be a healthier option for everyone.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Thanksgiving Recipes</h2>
    <p>Below, we’ve curated a selection of gluten-free recipes that cover all the Thanksgiving classics, from appetizers to desserts. These recipes are easy to follow and use ingredients that are readily available at most grocery stores.</p>

    <h3>1. Gluten-Free Stuffing</h3>
