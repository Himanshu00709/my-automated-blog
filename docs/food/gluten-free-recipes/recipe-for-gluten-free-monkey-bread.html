<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

<p>Start by activating the yeast. In a small bowl, combine the warm milk (around 110°F) with a teaspoon of sugar and the yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum (if needed), remaining sugar, and salt. Add the activated yeast mixture, melted butter, and eggs. Mix until a dough forms. The dough will be sticky, but that’s normal for gluten-free dough.</p>

<h3>2. Let the Dough Rise</h3>

<p>Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. Gluten-free dough may not rise as much as traditional dough, but it should still double in size. This step is crucial for achieving the right texture.</p>

<h3>3. Prepare the Coating</h3>

<p>While the dough is rising, prepare the coating mixture. In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar and cinnamon. In another bowl, melt the additional butter. Once the dough has risen, pinch off small pieces (about the size of a walnut) and roll them into balls. Dip each ball into the melted butter, then roll it in the cinnamon-sugar mixture.</p>

<h3>4. Assemble the Monkey Bread</h3>

<p>Grease a bundt pan or a similar baking dish. Place the coated dough balls into the pan, layering them evenly. Once all the dough balls are in the pan, drizzle any remaining butter and cinnamon-sugar mixture over the top. This will ensure that every bite is sweet and gooey.</p>

<h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the monkey bread for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the caramel is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, carefully invert the pan onto a serving plate. The monkey bread should slide out easily, revealing its beautiful, pull-apart structure.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can easily make this recipe dairy-free by using non-dairy milk (such as almond or oat milk) and vegan butter. The texture and taste will still be fantastic.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftover monkey bread?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. You can also refrigerate it for up to a week. To reheat, simply microwave individual portions for 10-15 seconds or warm in the oven at 300°F for 5-10 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free monkey bread?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked monkey bread. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 2 months. To reheat, thaw in the refrigerator overnight and then warm in the oven.</p>

    <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour blend to use?</h3>
    <p>For this recipe, a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend that includes xanthan gum works best. Brands like Bob’s Red Mill or King Arthur Flour are excellent choices. If your blend doesn’t include xanthan gum, be sure to add it separately.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free monkey bread is a delightful treat that proves you don’t need gluten to enjoy a delicious, gooey, and sweet dessert. With the right ingredients and a little patience, you can create a version that’s just as satisfying as the traditional recipe. Whether you’re serving it for breakfast, brunch, or dessert, this monkey bread is sure to be a hit. So, gather your ingredients, follow the steps, and get ready to enjoy a gluten-free treat that everyone will love!</p>
