<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Moo Shu Pork</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free Moo Shu Pork is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a delicious and healthy version of this classic dish:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>

<p>Start by thinly slicing the pork and marinating it in a mixture of gluten-free soy sauce, rice vinegar, and a touch of sesame oil. While the pork is marinating, prepare the vegetables by shredding the cabbage, slicing the mushrooms, and draining the bamboo shoots. Beat the eggs in a separate bowl and set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Stir-Fry the Pork</h3>

<p>Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat and add a tablespoon of oil. Once the oil is hot, add the marinated pork and stir-fry until it is cooked through. Remove the pork from the skillet and set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cook the Vegetables and Eggs</h3>

<p>In the same skillet, add a bit more oil if needed and stir-fry the vegetables until they are tender but still crisp. Push the vegetables to one side of the skillet and pour the beaten eggs into the other side. Scramble the eggs until they are fully cooked, then mix them with the vegetables.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Everything</h3>

<p>Return the cooked pork to the skillet and mix everything together. Add a few tablespoons of gluten-free hoisin sauce and stir to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve</h3>

<p>To serve, warm the gluten-free tortillas or rice paper according to the package instructions. Spread a small amount of hoisin sauce on each tortilla, then add a generous portion of the pork and vegetable mixture. Roll up the tortillas and enjoy!</p>
