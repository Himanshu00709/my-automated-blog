    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Korean BBQ Marinade</h2>
    <p>Creating a gluten-free Korean BBQ marinade is simple and requires just a few steps. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Ensure you have all the necessary ingredients on hand. For a basic gluten-free Korean BBQ marinade, you’ll need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup gluten-free tamari or coconut aminos</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons gluten-free gochujang or sriracha</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey or sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the tamari or coconut aminos, gochujang or sriracha, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, honey or sugar, and rice vinegar until well combined. Taste the marinade and adjust the seasoning if necessary. If you prefer a spicier marinade, add more gochujang or sriracha. For a sweeter marinade, increase the amount of honey or sugar.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Marinate Your Meat</h3>
    <p>Place your choice of meat (such as beef, pork, or chicken) in a large resealable bag or shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the meat, ensuring it’s fully coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Grill and Serve</h3>
    <p>When you’re ready to cook, remove the meat from the marinade and grill it to your desired level of doneness. Serve the grilled meat with steamed rice, kimchi, and other Korean side dishes for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Korean BBQ Marinade</h2>
    <p>Here are some additional tips to ensure your gluten-free Korean BBQ marinade turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh garlic and ginger will provide the best flavor. Avoid using pre-minced garlic or ginger paste, as they may contain additives or preservatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the Heat:</strong> If you’re sensitive to spice, start with a smaller amount of gochujang or sriracha and gradually increase it to suit your taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate Overnight:</strong> For the most flavorful results, marinate the meat overnight. This allows the flavors to fully infuse into the meat.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Proteins:</strong> While beef is the most common protein used in Korean BBQ, don’t be afraid to try this marinade with pork, chicken, or even tofu for a vegetarian option.</li>
    </ul>
