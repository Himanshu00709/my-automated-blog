    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Gluten-Free Pasta</h3>
    <p>Start by cooking the gluten-free elbow macaroni according to the package instructions. Be sure to cook it al dente, as it will continue to soften in the crock pot. Once cooked, drain the pasta and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Cheese Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Gradually whisk in the milk and heavy cream, ensuring there are no lumps. Add the shredded cheddar cheese, stirring constantly until the cheese is fully melted and the sauce is smooth. Season with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and paprika (if using).</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Pasta and Sauce in the Crock Pot</h3>
    <p>Transfer the cooked pasta to the crock pot. Pour the cheese sauce over the pasta, stirring gently to ensure the pasta is evenly coated. Cover the crock pot and cook on low heat for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the mac and cheese is heated through and the flavors have melded together, it’s ready to serve. Garnish with additional shredded cheese or a sprinkle of paprika for an extra touch of flavor. Serve hot and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Mac and Cheese</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Pasta:</strong> Not all gluten-free pastas are created equal. Look for brands that are known for their texture and ability to hold up in slow-cooked dishes.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Freshly Shredded Cheese:</strong> Pre-shredded cheese often contains anti-caking agents that can affect the smoothness of your sauce. Shredding your own cheese ensures a creamier texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcook:</strong> Keep an eye on the cooking time to prevent the pasta from becoming too soft. Gluten-free pasta can become mushy if overcooked.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While sharp cheddar is a classic choice, you can experiment with other cheeses like Gouda, Monterey Jack, or even a blend of cheeses for a unique flavor profile.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the milk, heavy cream, and cheese with dairy-free alternatives like almond milk, coconut cream, and vegan cheese. Just be sure to choose products that melt well for a creamy consistency.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop, adding a splash of milk to restore creaminess if needed.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free crock pot macaroni and cheese is a delicious and convenient way to enjoy a classic comfort food without the gluten. With simple ingredients and easy preparation, this dish is perfect for anyone looking to satisfy their mac and cheese cravings while adhering to a gluten-free diet. Whether you’re cooking for a family dinner or a potluck, this recipe is sure to be a hit. So, grab your crock pot and get ready to indulge in a bowl of creamy, cheesy goodness!</p>
