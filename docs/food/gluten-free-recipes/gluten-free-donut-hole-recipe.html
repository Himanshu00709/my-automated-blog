    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, salt, and granulated sugar. In a separate bowl, combine the melted butter, egg, milk, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a soft dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the donut holes dense.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Shape the Donut Holes</h3>

    <p>Using a small cookie scoop or a tablespoon, scoop out portions of the dough and roll them into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Place the dough balls on a parchment-lined baking sheet and let them rest for about 10 minutes. This will help them hold their shape during frying.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Fry the Donut Holes</h3>

    <p>Heat the vegetable oil in a deep fryer or a heavy-bottomed pot to 350°F (175°C). Carefully drop a few dough balls into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Fry the donut holes for 2-3 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Coat with Powdered Sugar</h3>

    <p>While the donut holes are still warm, roll them in powdered sugar until they are evenly coated. You can also use cinnamon sugar, glaze, or any other topping of your choice. Serve the donut holes warm for the best taste and texture.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Donut Holes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking and contains xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough donut holes. Mix the dough just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain the right oil temperature:</strong> If the oil is too hot, the donut holes will brown too quickly on the outside while remaining undercooked inside. If the oil is too cool, the donut holes will absorb too much oil and become greasy.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with toppings:</strong> While powdered sugar is a classic choice, feel free to get creative with your toppings. Try dipping the donut holes in melted chocolate, drizzling them with caramel, or sprinkling them with crushed nuts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I bake these donut holes instead of frying them?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake gluten-free donut holes if you prefer a healthier option. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and bake the dough balls on a parchment-lined baking sheet for 10-12 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Keep in mind that baked donut holes will have a slightly different texture than fried ones.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these donut holes ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before frying. You can also freeze the cooked donut holes and reheat them in the oven when ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of powdered sugar?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use powdered sugar, you can coat the donut holes in cinnamon sugar, a simple glaze, or even a dusting of cocoa powder. The possibilities are endless!</p>
