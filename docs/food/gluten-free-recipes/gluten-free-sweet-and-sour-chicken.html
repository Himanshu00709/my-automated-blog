    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free sweet and sour chicken:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Cut the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces. Season with salt and pepper, then coat each piece evenly with cornstarch. This will help create a crispy exterior when cooked.</p>

    <h3>2. Cook the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Sweet and Sour Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, whisk together the gluten-free soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, honey or maple syrup, and ketchup. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>4. Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add a bit more olive oil if needed. Sauté the onion, garlic, and bell peppers until they are tender, about 5 minutes.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Everything</h3>
    <p>Return the cooked chicken to the skillet with the vegetables. Pour the sweet and sour sauce over the chicken and vegetables, and add the pineapple chunks. Stir everything together and let it simmer for 5-10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>6. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve your gluten-free sweet and sour chicken over steamed rice or quinoa for a complete meal. Garnish with chopped green onions or sesame seeds if desired.</p>
