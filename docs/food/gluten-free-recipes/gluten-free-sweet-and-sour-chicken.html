    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Start by cutting the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces. In a bowl, mix the chicken with gluten-free soy sauce or tamari, ensuring each piece is well-coated. Let it marinate for at least 15 minutes to absorb the flavors.</p>

    <h3>2. Coating the Chicken</h3>
    <p>After marinating, coat each piece of chicken with cornstarch. This will help create a crispy exterior when fried. Make sure the chicken is evenly coated, shaking off any excess cornstarch.</p>

    <h3>3. Frying the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken pieces in batches, ensuring they are not overcrowded. Fry until golden brown and crispy, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove the chicken and set it aside on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</p>

    <h3>4. Preparing the Sweet and Sour Sauce</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add a bit more oil if needed, and sauté the minced garlic and ginger until fragrant. Add the sliced bell peppers and pineapple chunks, cooking until the peppers are slightly tender. In a separate bowl, whisk together rice vinegar, gluten-free ketchup, brown sugar, and water. Pour this mixture into the skillet, stirring well to combine.</p>

    <h3>5. Combining Everything</h3>
    <p>Return the fried chicken to the skillet, tossing it in the sweet and sour sauce until everything is well-coated. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Garnish with chopped green onions before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different type of flour for coating the chicken?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or even a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. However, cornstarch is preferred for its ability to create a crispy texture.</p>

        <h3>2. Is this recipe suitable for vegetarians?</h3>
        <p>This recipe is specifically for chicken, but you can easily adapt it for vegetarians by substituting the chicken with tofu or tempeh. Ensure that all other ingredients, including the sauce, are vegetarian-friendly.</p>

        <p>If you prefer a spicier version, you can add red pepper flakes, chili powder, or a dash of hot sauce to the sweet and sour sauce. Adjust the amount according to your heat preference.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the components of this dish ahead of time and store them separately. However, it’s best to combine the chicken and sauce just before serving to maintain the crispy texture of the chicken.</p>
