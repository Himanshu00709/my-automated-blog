    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free puppy chow:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cereal</h3>
    <p>Start by measuring out 6 cups of gluten-free Rice Chex cereal and placing it in a large mixing bowl. Make sure the bowl is big enough to allow for easy mixing later on.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Melt the Chocolate Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the gluten-free semi-sweet chocolate chips, gluten-free peanut butter, and unsalted butter. Microwave the mixture in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until the ingredients are fully melted and smooth. Be careful not to overheat the mixture, as this can cause the chocolate to seize.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Cereal and Chocolate Mixture</h3>
    <p>Once the chocolate mixture is smooth, pour it over the Rice Chex cereal in the large mixing bowl. Gently stir the cereal until it is evenly coated with the chocolate mixture. Be careful not to crush the cereal as you mix.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Powdered Sugar</h3>
    <p>Transfer the coated cereal to a large resealable plastic bag or a large container with a lid. Add the gluten-free powdered sugar to the bag or container, seal it, and shake vigorously until the cereal is evenly coated with the powdered sugar. You may need to do this in batches to ensure even coating.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Let It Set</h3>
    <p>Once the cereal is fully coated, spread it out on a baking sheet or a large piece of parchment paper to allow it to set. Let it sit for about 15-20 minutes, or until the chocolate mixture has hardened.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy!</h3>
    <p>Once the puppy chow has set, transfer it to a serving bowl or an airtight container for storage. This gluten-free treat is perfect for snacking, sharing, or gifting. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free cereal?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free cereal that has a similar texture to Rice Chex. Corn Chex or gluten-free crispy rice cereal are great alternatives.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make this recipe dairy-free, simply substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or a plant-based butter. Ensure that the chocolate chips you use are also dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How long does gluten-free puppy chow last?</h3>
        <p>When stored in an airtight container, gluten-free puppy chow can last for up to a week. Keep it in a cool, dry place to maintain its freshness and crunch.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other ingredients to the mix?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize your puppy chow by adding ingredients like gluten-free pretzels, nuts, or dried fruit. Just make sure any additional ingredients are also gluten-free.</p>
