    <h1>Gluten-Free Crumble with Tapioca Flour (No Oats)</h1>
    <p>For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding delicious and satisfying desserts can sometimes be a challenge. However, with the right ingredients and techniques, you can create mouthwatering treats that everyone will love. One such dessert is a gluten-free crumble made with tapioca flour and without oats. This recipe is perfect for those who are gluten-intolerant or simply looking for a healthier alternative to traditional crumbles. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of using tapioca flour, provide a step-by-step guide to making a gluten-free crumble, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Tapioca Flour for Gluten-Free Baking?</h2>
    <p>Tapioca flour, also known as tapioca starch, is a popular gluten-free flour that is derived from the cassava root. It is known for its light, chewy texture and its ability to thicken sauces and bind ingredients together. Unlike other gluten-free flours, tapioca flour has a neutral flavor, making it an excellent choice for both sweet and savory dishes. Additionally, tapioca flour is rich in carbohydrates and provides a quick source of energy, making it a great option for those with active lifestyles.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Crumble with Tapioca Flour</h2>
    <p>To make a gluten-free crumble without oats, you’ll need the following ingredients:</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Fruit Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by preparing your fruit filling. If you’re using fresh fruit, wash and chop it into bite-sized pieces. For frozen fruit, allow it to thaw slightly. Place the fruit in a baking dish and sprinkle with a little coconut sugar and cinnamon to enhance the natural sweetness.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Crumble Topping</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the tapioca flour, almond flour, coconut sugar, ground cinnamon, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of the ingredients. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry mixture. Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the vanilla extract for added flavor.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Sprinkle the crumble topping evenly over the prepared fruit in the baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling. Allow the crumble to cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Crumble</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for achieving the perfect crumbly texture. If the butter is too soft, the topping may become dense.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Fruits:</strong> Feel free to experiment with different fruits depending on the season. Apples, pears, berries, and stone fruits all work well in this recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Nuts or Seeds:</strong> For added texture and nutrition, consider adding chopped nuts or seeds to the crumble topping.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour instead of tapioca flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute tapioca flour with other gluten-free flours such as rice flour or potato starch. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this recipe can easily be made vegan by using a plant-based butter alternative instead of regular butter.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this crumble ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the crumble topping and fruit filling separately and store them in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. When you’re ready to bake, simply assemble and bake as directed.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftover crumble can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
