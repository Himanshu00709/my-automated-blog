    <h3>1. Cook the Pasta</h3>
    <p>Start by cooking the gluten-free pasta according to the package instructions. Be sure to cook it al dente, as it will continue to cook in the oven. Drain and set aside.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and sauté until they’re tender and golden brown.

    <h3>4. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish. Sprinkle the top with gluten-free breadcrumbs and extra Parmesan cheese. Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</p>

    <h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the tetrazzini to cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired, and enjoy your gluten-free comfort food masterpiece!</p>
