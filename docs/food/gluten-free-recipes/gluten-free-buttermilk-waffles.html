    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, melted butter, vanilla extract, and sugar. The buttermilk adds a tangy flavor and helps create a light, fluffy texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense waffles.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Preheat the Waffle Iron</h3>
    <p>Preheat your waffle iron according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Lightly grease the iron with cooking spray or a small amount of melted butter to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cook the Waffles</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter onto the preheated waffle iron, using about 1/2 cup of batter for each waffle. Close the lid and cook until the waffles are golden brown and crisp, usually about 3-5 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Serve the waffles warm with your favorite toppings, such as fresh berries, maple syrup, or a dollop of whipped cream. Enjoy your gluten-free buttermilk waffles as a delicious and healthy breakfast option!</p>
