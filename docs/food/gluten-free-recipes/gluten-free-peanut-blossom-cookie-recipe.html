    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugars</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add the peanut butter, egg, vanilla extract, and milk to the butter-sugar mixture. Mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cookies tough.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Shape the Dough</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, scoop out portions of dough and roll them into 1-inch balls. Roll each ball in granulated sugar to coat evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Place the dough balls on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Add the Hershey's Kisses</h3>
    <p>Immediately after removing the cookies from the oven, press a Hershey's Kiss into the center of each cookie. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Peanut Blossom Cookies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overbake:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can dry out quickly, so keep a close eye on them during baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the cookies cool:</strong> The Hershey's Kisses will melt if the cookies are too hot, so allow them to cool slightly before adding the chocolate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use natural peanut butter?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use natural peanut butter, but keep in mind that it may alter the texture of the cookies slightly. Natural peanut butter tends to be oilier, so you may need to adjust the amount of flour.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a dairy-free milk option.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of chocolate?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other types of chocolate, such as dark chocolate or white chocolate, instead of Hershey's Kisses. Just make sure the chocolate is gluten-free.</p>
