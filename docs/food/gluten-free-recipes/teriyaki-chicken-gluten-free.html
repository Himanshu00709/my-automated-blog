    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Teriyaki Chicken</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free teriyaki chicken at home is simple and requires just a few ingredients. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating this delicious dish:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1/2 cup gluten-free soy sauce or tamari</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey or maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch (optional, for thickening)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water (optional, for thickening)</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds and chopped green onions for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken breasts in a large resealable bag or shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Ensure the chicken is well-coated. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours for more flavor.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade (reserve the marinade) and cook for 5-6 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is cooked through and reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, pour the reserved marinade into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. If you prefer a thicker sauce, mix the cornstarch with water and stir it into the simmering sauce until it thickens.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is cooked, pour the teriyaki sauce over it and garnish with sesame seeds and green onions. Serve with steamed rice or your favorite gluten-free side dish.</li>
    </ol>
