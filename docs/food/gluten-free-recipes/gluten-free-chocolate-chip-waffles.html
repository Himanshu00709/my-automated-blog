        <li>Combine the wet and dry ingredients, stirring until just incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease the waffle iron with cooking spray or a small amount of butter.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Waffles</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking can be tricky, but these tips will help you achieve waffle perfection:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense waffles. Stir until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Batter Rest:</strong> Allowing the batter to rest for 5-10 minutes before cooking gives the flour time to absorb the liquid, resulting in a better texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> Gluten-free waffles are a blank canvas. Try adding nuts, berries, or even a drizzle of nut butter for extra flavor and nutrition.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Waffles</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I make these waffles vegan?</h3>
