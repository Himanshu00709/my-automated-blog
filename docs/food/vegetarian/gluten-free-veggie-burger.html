    <h2>How to Make a Gluten-Free Veggie Burger at Home</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free veggie burger at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating your own delicious and nutritious burger:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by gathering all your ingredients. If using canned beans, make sure to rinse and drain them thoroughly. Cook any grains like quinoa or rice according to package instructions. Chop vegetables like onions, garlic, and sweet potatoes into small pieces.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Combine and Mash</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the beans, cooked grains, and chopped vegetables. Use a potato masher or fork to mash the ingredients together until they form a chunky mixture. Add spices, herbs, and a binding agent like flaxseeds or gluten-free breadcrumbs.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Form the Patties</h3>
    <p>Once the mixture is well combined, divide it into equal portions and shape them into patties. Make sure the patties are firm enough to hold their shape during cooking. If the mixture is too wet, add more binding agents.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Patties</h3>
    <p>You can cook the patties in a skillet over medium heat with a bit of oil, or bake them in the oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through. For a smoky flavor, you can also grill the patties.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Assemble the Burger</h3>
    <p>Once the patties are cooked, assemble your burger with gluten-free buns, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and your favorite condiments. Enjoy your homemade gluten-free veggie burger!</p>
