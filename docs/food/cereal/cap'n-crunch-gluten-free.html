    <h1>Cap'n Crunch Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For many cereal lovers, Cap'n Crunch has been a staple breakfast option for decades. Its unique texture and sweet flavor have made it a favorite among children and adults alike. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this iconic cereal has been a challenge—until now.
