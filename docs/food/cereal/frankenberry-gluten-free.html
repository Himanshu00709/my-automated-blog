    <h1>Frankenberry Gluten-Free: A Delicious and Inclusive Treat</h1>

    <p>For decades, Frankenberry cereal has been a beloved part of breakfast tables across America. Known for its vibrant pink color and sweet berry flavor, this iconic cereal has been a staple for many. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, many fans of Frankenberry have wondered: Is Frankenberry gluten-free? The good news is that Frankenberry has joined the ranks of gluten-free cereals, making it a delicious and inclusive treat for everyone to enjoy.</p>

    <h2>The History of Frankenberry Cereal</h2>

    <p>Frankenberry was first introduced by General Mills in 1971 as part of their "Monster Cereals" line, which also included Count Chocula and Boo Berry. The cereal was an instant hit, thanks to its unique strawberry flavor and fun, monster-themed branding. Over the years, Frankenberry has become a nostalgic favorite for many, evoking memories of childhood mornings spent with a bowl of cereal and a cartoon on TV.</p>

    <p>However, as dietary needs and preferences have evolved, so too has the demand for gluten-free options. Recognizing this shift, General Mills has made efforts to ensure that Frankenberry is accessible to a wider audience, including those who need or choose to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Frankenberry Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Frankenberry is made with a blend of whole grain oats and corn, both of which are naturally gluten-free. However, it's important to note that oats can sometimes be contaminated with gluten during processing if they are grown or processed near wheat, barley, or rye. To address this concern, General Mills has implemented strict protocols to ensure that the oats used in Frankenberry are certified gluten-free.</p>

    <p>In addition to the oats and corn, Frankenberry's ingredients include sugar, corn syrup, and natural and artificial flavors. The cereal is also fortified with vitamins and minerals, making it a nutritious option for breakfast or a snack. The gluten-free version of Frankenberry has been carefully formulated to maintain the same great taste and texture that fans have come to love, while also meeting the needs of those on a gluten-free diet.</p>
