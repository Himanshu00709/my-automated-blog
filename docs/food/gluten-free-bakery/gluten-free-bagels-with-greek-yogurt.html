    <h1>Gluten-Free Bagels with Greek Yogurt: A Healthy Twist</h1>
    <p>Bagels are a beloved breakfast staple, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional bagels are off the menu. Enter gluten-free bagels made with Greek yogurt—a delicious and nutritious alternative that doesn’t compromise on taste or texture. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free bagels, how Greek yogurt enhances their nutritional profile, and provide a step-by-step guide to making your own at home.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Bagels?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals seeking to reduce inflammation or improve digestive health. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause adverse reactions in sensitive individuals. Gluten-free bagels offer a safe and satisfying option for those avoiding gluten while still enjoying a classic breakfast favorite.</p>

    <h2>The Role of Greek Yogurt in Gluten-Free Bagels</h2>
    <p>Greek yogurt is a versatile ingredient that adds moisture, protein, and a slight tanginess to gluten-free bagels. Unlike traditional bagels that rely on gluten for their chewy texture, gluten-free versions often struggle with dryness. Greek yogurt helps to counteract this by providing a rich, creamy base that binds the ingredients together. Additionally, Greek yogurt is packed with probiotics, calcium, and protein, making these bagels not only gluten-free but also nutrient-dense.</p>
