<h1>Gluten-Free and Dairy-Free Halloween Candy: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Halloween is a time of spooky fun, creative costumes, and, of course, candy! However, for those with dietary restrictions such as gluten intolerance or lactose intolerance, finding safe and delicious Halloween treats can be a challenge. Fortunately, the market for gluten-free and dairy-free candies has expanded significantly in recent years, offering a wide variety of options for everyone to enjoy. In this guide, we’ll explore the best gluten-free and dairy-free Halloween candies, provide tips for navigating trick-or-treating, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

<h2>Why Gluten-Free and Dairy-Free Candy Matters</h2>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or lactose intolerance, consuming gluten or dairy can lead to uncomfortable and sometimes severe health issues. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive problems, fatigue, and other symptoms in those with celiac disease. Similarly, dairy products can cause bloating, gas, and other digestive issues for those who are lactose intolerant. Therefore, it’s essential to choose candies that are free from these ingredients to ensure a safe and enjoyable Halloween experience.</p>
