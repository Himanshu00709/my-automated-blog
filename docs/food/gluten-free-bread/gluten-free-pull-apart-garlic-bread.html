    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt. In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until frothy. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients, and mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes until smooth.</p>

    <h3>2. Let the Dough Rise</h3>
    <p>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Garlic Butter</h3>
    <p>While the dough is rising, mince the garlic cloves and chop the parsley. In a small bowl, mix the garlic, parsley, and melted butter. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Bread</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into small balls (about 1-2 inches in diameter). Dip each ball into the garlic butter mixture and place them in a greased baking dish, layering them as you go. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella between the layers for extra cheesiness.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the bread for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown and bubbly. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>
