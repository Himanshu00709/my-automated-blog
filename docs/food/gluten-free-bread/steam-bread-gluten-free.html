<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Steam Bread</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free steam bread at home is simpler than you might think. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you create your own delicious and healthy steam bread.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend (ensure it contains xanthan gum or add 1 tsp separately)</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 tbsp sugar (optional, for a slightly sweet flavor)</li>
    <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1 cup warm water (adjust as needed)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp oil (optional, for added moisture)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the warm water and oil (if using) to the dry ingredients. Stir until a dough forms. The dough should be soft but not sticky. Adjust the water or flour as needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Divide the dough into small portions and shape them into balls or desired shapes. Place each portion on a piece of parchment paper or a steamer liner to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Steam the Bread:</strong> Bring water to a boil in a steamer. Place the shaped dough into the steamer, ensuring they are not touching. Steam for about 15-20 minutes, or until the bread is cooked through and springs back when touched.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Remove the bread from the steamer and let it cool slightly before serving. Enjoy warm or at room temperature.</li>
