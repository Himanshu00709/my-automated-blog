    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Pull-Apart Bread</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free pull-apart bread may seem daunting, but with the right steps, it’s a rewarding process. Follow this guide to create a loaf that’s soft, fluffy, and irresistible.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by activating the yeast. In a small bowl, combine warm milk (or a non-dairy alternative), sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt. Add the yeast mixture, eggs, and melted butter. Mix until a sticky dough forms.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Let the Dough Rise</h3>
    <p>Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. The dough should double in size. This step is crucial for achieving a light and airy texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Bread</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into small, equal-sized pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and arrange them in a greased loaf pan, leaving a little space between each ball. This creates the pull-apart effect.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Second Rise</h3>
    <p>Cover the loaf pan with a kitchen towel and let the dough rise again for 30-45 minutes. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) during this time.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Bread</h3>
    <p>Bake the bread in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when tapped. Let it cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pull-Apart Bread</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. A blend of rice flour, almond flour, and tapioca starch often works well.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make this bread dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the milk with a non-dairy alternative like almond or oat milk, and use vegan butter instead of regular butter.</p>

        <h3>3. How do I store gluten-free pull-apart bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly and freeze it for up to 1 month.</p>

        <h3>4. Why is my bread dense?</h3>
        <p>Dense bread can result from overmixing the dough, not letting it rise long enough, or using too much flour. Ensure you follow the recipe closely and measure ingredients accurately.</p>
