    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Irish Brown Bread</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free Irish brown bread is surprisingly simple. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create this delicious bread at home:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your bread bakes evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free wholemeal flour, oat flour, xanthan gum, baking soda, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, egg, and honey (or molasses). Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) and shape it into a round loaf. Place the loaf on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the bread in the preheated oven for about 40-45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the bread to cool on a wire rack before slicing. Serve with butter, jam, or your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Irish Brown Bread</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free Irish brown bread turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use fresh ingredients:</strong> Fresh baking soda and buttermilk are essential for achieving the right rise and texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to a dense loaf. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it cool:</strong> Allow the bread to cool completely before slicing. This helps the bread set and makes it easier to cut.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Irish Brown Bread</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as almond flour or buckwheat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Is gluten-free Irish brown bread suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Traditional recipes include buttermilk and eggs, but you can make a vegan version by using plant-based milk (like almond or soy milk) mixed with a tablespoon of vinegar to mimic buttermilk, and a flax egg as a binder.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or seeds to the bread?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Adding nuts or seeds, such as sunflower seeds or chopped walnuts, can enhance the texture and nutritional value of the bread.</p>

        <h3>How do I know when the bread is done baking?</h3>
        <p>The bread is done when the crust is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. You can also tap the bottom of the loaf—if it sounds hollow, it’s done.</p>
    </div>
