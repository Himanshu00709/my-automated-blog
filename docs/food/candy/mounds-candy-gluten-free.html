Additionally, the manufacturing process for Mounds ensures that there is no cross-contamination with gluten-containing products, which is a critical consideration for those with severe gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <p>It’s important to note that while Mounds is gluten-free, individuals with celiac disease should always check the packaging for any updates or changes in ingredients, as formulations can occasionally change.</p>
