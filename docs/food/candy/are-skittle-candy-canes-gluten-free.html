            </tr>

    <p>As you can see, the primary ingredients in Skittle Candy Canes are gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that the term “natural and artificial flavors” can sometimes be a gray area. While these flavors are typically gluten-free, there’s always a slight risk of cross-contamination during manufacturing.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing Processes and Cross-Contamination</h2>

    <p>Even if the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing can be a concern. Many candy manufacturers produce a variety of products in the same facility, some of which may contain gluten. To ensure that Skittle Candy Canes are safe for those with gluten sensitivities, it’s essential to look for a gluten-free certification on the packaging.</p>

    <p>Skittles, the parent brand of Skittle Candy Canes, has stated that their products are gluten-free. However, it’s always a good idea to check the packaging for any allergen warnings or certifications. If the packaging does not explicitly state that the product is gluten-free, it’s best to contact the manufacturer directly for clarification.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free certification is a reliable way to ensure that a product is safe for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Certified gluten-free products have undergone rigorous testing to confirm that they contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten, which is the threshold considered safe by the FDA.</p>

    <p>While Skittle Candy Canes may not always carry a gluten-free certification, the ingredients and manufacturing processes suggest that they are likely safe for most people with gluten sensitivities. However, if you have severe celiac disease, it’s always best to err on the side of caution and choose products with a clear gluten-free label.</p>
