    <h1>Three Musketeers Candy: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

    <p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding delicious treats that are safe to eat can be a challenge. Fortunately, Three Musketeers candy bars have long been a favorite among candy lovers, and the good news is that they are gluten-free! In this article, we’ll explore the history of Three Musketeers, what makes them gluten-free, and why they are a great option for those avoiding gluten. We’ll also answer some frequently asked questions about this iconic candy bar.</p>

    <h2>The History of Three Musketeers Candy</h2>

    <p>Three Musketeers candy bars were first introduced by Mars, Incorporated in 1932. Originally, the bar contained three pieces with different flavors: chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. However, due to the economic constraints of the Great Depression, the company decided to streamline the product to just one flavor—chocolate. The name "Three Musketeers" was retained as a nod to the original trio of flavors.</p>

    <p>Today, Three Musketeers is known for its light and fluffy nougat center, which is covered in a rich, milk chocolate coating. The candy bar has remained a popular choice for those who enjoy a sweet treat without the heaviness of other chocolate bars.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Three Musketeers Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Three Musketeers candy bars are made with simple ingredients that do not include gluten. The primary components of the candy bar are sugar, corn syrup, hydrogenated palm kernel oil, and cocoa. The nougat center is made by whipping egg whites and sugar to create a light, airy texture, which is then coated in milk chocolate.</p>

    <p>Mars, Incorporated has confirmed that Three Musketeers bars do not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, it’s important to note that while the ingredients themselves are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. Mars has stated that they take precautions to prevent cross-contamination, but they do not label Three Musketeers as "gluten-free" due to the potential risk.</p>
