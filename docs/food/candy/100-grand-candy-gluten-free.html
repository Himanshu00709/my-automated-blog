In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about 100 Grand candy, its ingredients, and whether it’s safe for a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h2>What Makes 100 Grand Candy So Special?</h2>

    <p>100 Grand candy bars, originally introduced in 1966, have stood the test of time due to their unique texture and flavor profile. The candy features a layer of chewy caramel, a crispy rice center, and a smooth milk chocolate coating. This combination creates a delightful contrast of textures that has made it a beloved treat for generations. But beyond its taste, what really sets 100 Grand apart is its accessibility to those with dietary restrictions, particularly gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>Is 100 Grand Candy Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>For individuals who need to avoid gluten, whether due to celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it’s crucial to know which foods are safe to consume. The good news is that 100 Grand candy bars are considered gluten-free. According to the manufacturer, Nestlé, 100 Grand bars do not contain any gluten-containing ingredients. However, it’s always important to check the packaging for any potential cross-contamination warnings, as manufacturing processes can vary.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients in 100 Grand Candy</h3>

    <p>To better understand why 100 Grand candy is gluten-free, let’s take a closer look at its ingredients:</p>

    <table>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Caramel</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Crispy Rice</td>
                <td>Yes</td>

Therefore, if you have a severe gluten allergy, it’s advisable to consult with your healthcare provider before consuming 100 Grand candy.</p>
