<h1>Brach's Candy Corn: A Gluten-Free Treat</h1>

<p>When it comes to classic Halloween treats, few candies are as iconic as Brach's Candy Corn. This tri-colored, cone-shaped candy has been a staple in candy bowls for generations.

<h2>What is Brach's Candy Corn?</h2>

<p>Brach's Candy Corn is a type of confectionery that is primarily made from sugar, corn syrup, and marshmallow creme.

<h2>Is Brach's Candy Corn Gluten-Free?</h2>

None of these ingredients contain gluten, which makes Brach's Candy Corn a gluten-free candy option.</p>
