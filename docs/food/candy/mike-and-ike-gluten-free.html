<h1>Mike and Ike Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Mike and Ike candies have been a beloved treat for generations, known for their vibrant colors, fruity flavors, and chewy texture. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying these candies can be a concern. In this article, we’ll explore whether Mike and Ike candies are gluten-free, delve into their ingredients, and provide you with all the information you need to enjoy these treats worry-free.</p>

<h2>Are Mike and Ike Candies Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Yes, Mike and Ike candies are gluten-free. According to the manufacturer, Just Born, Inc., Mike and Ike products do not contain gluten ingredients.

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even small amounts of gluten can cause symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. For those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten can cause similar symptoms, though without the intestinal damage. Therefore, it’s crucial for these individuals to carefully select foods that are certified gluten-free.</p>
