    <h2>What Are Airheads?</h2>

    <p>Airheads are a popular chewy candy known for their vibrant colors and tangy flavors. Introduced in the 1980s, they quickly became a staple in candy aisles across the United States. The candy is available in a variety of flavors, including cherry, watermelon, blue raspberry, and more. Airheads are loved for their unique texture, which is both chewy and slightly taffy-like, making them a fun and satisfying treat for people of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Are Airheads Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Yes, Airheads are gluten-free! According to the manufacturer, Perfetti Van Melle, Airheads do not contain any gluten ingredients. This makes them a safe option for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it’s always important to check the packaging for any updates or changes in ingredients, as formulations can vary over time.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients in Airheads</h3>

    <p>To better understand why Airheads are gluten-free, let’s take a closer look at their ingredients. The primary components of Airheads include:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Sugar</td>
                <td>Provides sweetness and structure</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Corn Syrup</td>
                <td>Adds chewiness and moisture</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Maltodextrin</td>
                <td>Used as a thickener and stabilizer</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Dextrose</td>
                <td>Enhances sweetness and texture</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Modified Corn Starch</td>
                <td>Helps maintain the candy's shape</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Artificial Flavors</td>
                <td>Provides the signature taste</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Artificial Colors</td>
                <td>Gives the candy its vibrant hues</td>

However, if you have severe gluten sensitivity, it’s always a good idea to contact the manufacturer directly for the most up-to-date information.</p>
