    <p>From the ingredients list, it appears that Brach's Classic Candy Corn does not contain any obvious sources of gluten. However, it's important to note that the absence of gluten-containing ingredients does not necessarily mean that the product is entirely gluten-free.

For individuals with celiac disease, even trace amounts of gluten can trigger a reaction.</p>

While the company does not explicitly state that their Classic Candy Corn is gluten-free, they do provide allergen information on their packaging and website. It's always a good idea to check the packaging for any allergen warnings or statements about gluten.</p>
