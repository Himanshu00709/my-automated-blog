<h2>Tips for Baking Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>

<p>Baking gluten-free cookies from frozen dough can be a bit different from baking traditional cookies. Here are some tips to ensure your cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong> Always preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the packaging. This ensures even baking and prevents undercooked or overcooked cookies.</li>
    <li><strong>Space Out the Dough:</strong> Gluten-free cookies may spread more than traditional cookies, so be sure to space the dough portions at least 2 inches apart on the baking sheet.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Parchment Paper:</strong> Line your baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent sticking and make cleanup easier.</li>
    <li><strong>Monitor Baking Time:</strong> Gluten-free cookies may bake faster than traditional cookies, so keep a close eye on them to avoid overbaking.</li>
    <li><strong>Let Them Cool:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack. This helps them set and prevents them from falling apart.</li>
</ul>
