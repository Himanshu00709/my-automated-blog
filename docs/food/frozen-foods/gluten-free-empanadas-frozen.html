<h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Frozen Empanadas</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free frozen empanadas is simple and straightforward. Here’s a step-by-step guide to ensure they come out perfectly every time:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the packaging, usually around 375°F (190°C).</li>

    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the empanadas for the recommended time, usually 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and heated through. If you prefer a crispier crust, you can brush the empanadas with a little oil before baking.</li>
