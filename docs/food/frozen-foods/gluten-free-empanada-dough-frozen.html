    <h2>How to Use Frozen Gluten-Free Empanada Dough</h2>

    <p>Using frozen gluten-free empanada dough is straightforward, but there are a few tips to ensure the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Thawing:</strong> Allow the dough to thaw in the refrigerator overnight or at room temperature for a few hours. Avoid microwaving, as it can alter the texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Rolling:</strong> Lightly dust your work surface with gluten-free flour to prevent sticking. Roll the dough to your desired thickness, usually about 1/8 inch.</li>
        <li><strong>Filling:</strong> Add your favorite gluten-free fillings, such as seasoned meats, cheeses, or vegetables. Be careful not to overfill, as this can cause the dough to tear.</li>
        <li><strong>Sealing:</strong> Use a fork or your fingers to seal the edges of the empanadas. Ensure the edges are well-sealed to prevent leakage during baking or frying.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooking:</strong> Bake or fry the empanadas according to your preference. Baking is a healthier option, while frying provides a crispier texture.</li>
