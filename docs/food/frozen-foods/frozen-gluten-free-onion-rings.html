    <h1>Frozen Gluten-Free Onion Rings: A Crispy Delight</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of celiac disease and gluten intolerance.

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Onion Rings?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free onion rings are made using a batter or coating that does not contain any gluten-containing ingredients, such as wheat, barley, or rye. Instead, they are typically coated with a mixture of gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, cornmeal, or almond flour, along with seasonings to enhance their flavor. The onions are then sliced into rings, coated, and frozen to preserve their freshness and texture. When cooked, they provide a crispy exterior with a tender, flavorful onion inside.</p>

        <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Frozen onion rings are pre-prepared, meaning you can enjoy a quick and easy snack or side dish without the hassle of making them from scratch.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> The freezing process helps maintain the texture and flavor of the onion rings, ensuring a consistent taste every time you cook them.</li>
        <li><strong>Dietary Needs:</strong> For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, frozen gluten-free onion rings provide a safe and delicious alternative to traditional onion rings.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> These onion rings can be baked, fried, or air-fried, making them a versatile addition to any meal.</li>
