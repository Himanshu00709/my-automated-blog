    <h1>Gluten-Free Frozen Fries: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the growing popularity of gluten-free diets. Among the many gluten-free options available, frozen fries have become a staple in many households. But not all frozen fries are created equal.

Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Therefore, ensuring that frozen fries are gluten-free is crucial for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> They can be used as a side dish, a snack, or even as a base for more elaborate meals like loaded fries or poutine.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Potatoes are a good source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber, especially when the skin is left on.</li>
    </ul>
