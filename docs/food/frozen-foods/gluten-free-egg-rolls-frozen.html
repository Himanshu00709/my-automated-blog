    <h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Frozen Egg Rolls</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free frozen egg rolls is simple and can be done in several ways, depending on your preference and available kitchen tools. Here are the most common methods:</p>

    <h3>1. Baking</h3>
    <p>Baking is a healthier option that results in a crispy exterior without the need for excessive oil. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C), place the egg rolls on a baking sheet, and bake for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through.</p>

    <h3>2. Air Frying</h3>
    <p>Air frying is a popular method for achieving a crispy texture with minimal oil. Preheat your air fryer to 375°F (190°C), place the egg rolls in the basket, and cook for 10-12 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through.</p>

    <h3>3. Pan-Frying</h3>
    <p>For a more traditional approach, pan-frying can give you that golden, crispy crust. Heat a small amount of oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the egg rolls for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown.</p>
