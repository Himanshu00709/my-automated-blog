    <h2>What is Bang Bang Shrimp?</h2>

    <p>Bang Bang Shrimp is a popular appetizer or main dish that originated in American seafood restaurants. It typically consists of crispy fried shrimp tossed in a creamy, spicy, and slightly sweet sauce. The name "Bang Bang" comes from the explosive flavor combination that hits your taste buds with every bite. However, traditional recipes often use wheat-based flour for the batter, making it unsuitable for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Shrimp</h3>

    <p>Start by rinsing the shrimp under cold water and patting them dry with a paper towel. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper to taste. In a bowl, whisk together the egg and milk to create an egg wash. In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free flour and cornstarch.</p>

    <h3>2. Coat the Shrimp</h3>

    <p>Dip each shrimp into the egg wash, then coat it thoroughly with the gluten-free flour mixture. Make sure each shrimp is evenly coated to ensure a crispy texture when fried.</p>

    <h3>3. Fry the Shrimp</h3>

    <p>Heat oil in a deep skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the coated shrimp in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry the shrimp for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove the shrimp from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</p>

    <h3>4. Prepare the Bang Bang Sauce</h3>

    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, sweet chili sauce, sriracha, and honey. Adjust the amount of sriracha to your preferred level of spiciness. Stir until the sauce is smooth and well combined.</p>

    <h3>5. Toss the Shrimp in the Sauce</h3>

    <p>Once the shrimp are fried and drained, place them in a large bowl. Pour the Bang Bang sauce over the shrimp and gently toss until each shrimp is evenly coated with the sauce.</p>

    <h3>6. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Serve the gluten-free Bang Bang Shrimp immediately as an appetizer or main dish. Garnish with chopped green onions or sesame seeds for added flavor and presentation.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Bang Bang Shrimp</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free Bang Bang Shrimp is not only delicious but also offers several nutritional benefits. Shrimp is a low-calorie, high-protein seafood that is rich in essential nutrients like iodine, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids. By using gluten-free flour, you avoid the potential digestive issues associated with gluten, making this dish suitable for a wider range of dietary needs. Additionally, the use of healthy fats in the sauce, such as those found in mayonnaise, can provide a source of energy and support overall health.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I bake the shrimp instead of frying?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake the shrimp for a healthier alternative. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and place the coated shrimp on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 10-12 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the shrimp are golden and crispy.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can use any gluten-free flour of your choice, such as coconut flour, chickpea flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Just keep in mind that different flours may slightly alter the texture and flavor of the shrimp.</p>

        <h3>3. How can I make the sauce less spicy?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer a milder sauce, reduce the amount of sriracha or omit it altogether. You can also add a bit more honey or sweet chili sauce to balance the flavors.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make this dish ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>While the shrimp are best served fresh, you can prepare the sauce and coat the shrimp in advance. Store the coated shrimp in the refrigerator and fry them just before serving to maintain their crispiness.</p>
