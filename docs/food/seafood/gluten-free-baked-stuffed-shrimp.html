    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing the Shrimp</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). While the oven is heating, prepare the shrimp by making a deep cut along the back of each shrimp, creating a pocket for the stuffing. Be careful not to cut all the way through. This step ensures that the stuffing stays in place during baking.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Stuffing</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, minced garlic, chopped parsley, and lemon zest. Drizzle in the olive oil and mix until the ingredients are well combined. The mixture should be moist but not too wet. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>3. Stuffing the Shrimp</h3>
    <p>Take a small amount of the stuffing mixture and press it into the pocket you created in each shrimp. Arrange the stuffed shrimp in a single layer on a baking dish lined with parchment paper or lightly greased with olive oil.</p>

    <h3>4. Baking the Shrimp</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the shrimp are pink and opaque, and the stuffing is golden brown. Be careful not to overcook the shrimp, as they can become tough and rubbery.</p>

    <h3>5. Serving the Dish</h3>
    <p>Once the shrimp are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Serve the baked stuffed shrimp with a side of gluten-free pasta, a fresh salad, or steamed vegetables for a complete meal. A squeeze of fresh lemon juice over the shrimp before serving adds a bright, tangy flavor.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Baked Stuffed Shrimp</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baked stuffed shrimp is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Shrimp is a low-calorie, high-protein seafood that provides essential nutrients such as iodine, selenium, and vitamin B12. The gluten-free breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese add a satisfying crunch and flavor without compromising dietary restrictions. This dish is also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial for heart health.</p>
