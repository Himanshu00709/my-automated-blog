    <h1>Gluten-Free Calamari: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>When it comes to seafood, calamari is a popular choice for many. Its tender texture and mild flavor make it a versatile ingredient that can be prepared in a variety of ways. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying calamari can be a challenge, especially when it's traditionally coated in wheat flour and deep-fried. Enter gluten-free calamari—a delicious and healthy alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this seafood delicacy without the worry of gluten-related health issues.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Calamari?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free calamari is essentially calamari that has been prepared without any gluten-containing ingredients. Traditional calamari is often coated in wheat flour before being fried, which can be problematic for those who need to avoid gluten. In gluten-free versions, the flour is replaced with gluten-free alternatives such as rice flour, almond flour, or a gluten-free flour blend. This not only makes the dish safe for those with gluten sensitivities but also adds a unique flavor and texture that can be just as satisfying, if not more so, than the traditional version.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Calamari?</h2>

    <p>There are several reasons why someone might choose gluten-free calamari over the traditional version. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it's a necessity. Consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health problems. But even for those without gluten intolerance, gluten-free calamari can be a healthier option. Many gluten-free flours are lower in calories and carbohydrates than wheat flour, and they can also provide additional nutrients. For example, almond flour is high in protein and healthy fats, while rice flour is a good source of fiber.</p>
