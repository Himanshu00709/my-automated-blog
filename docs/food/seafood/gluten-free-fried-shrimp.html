    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Fried Shrimp</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free fried shrimp is a straightforward process that involves a few key steps. Follow this guide to achieve the perfect dish:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Shrimp:</strong> Start by cleaning and deveining the shrimp. Leave the tails on for easier handling and presentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Up a Breading Station:</strong> In one bowl, mix the gluten-free flour and cornstarch. In another bowl, beat the eggs. In a third bowl, place the gluten-free breadcrumbs or panko mixed with your desired seasonings.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the Shrimp:</strong> Dredge each shrimp in the flour mixture, then dip it into the beaten eggs, and finally coat it with the breadcrumb mixture. Ensure each shrimp is evenly coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong> In a deep skillet or fryer, heat the oil to 350°F (175°C). The oil should be hot enough to fry the shrimp but not so hot that it burns the coating.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Shrimp:</strong> Carefully place the coated shrimp into the hot oil. Fry in batches to avoid overcrowding, which can lower the oil temperature and result in soggy shrimp. Fry for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Serve:</strong> Remove the shrimp from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Fried Shrimp</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free fried shrimp turns out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Shrimp:</strong> Fresh shrimp will yield the best flavor and texture. If using frozen shrimp, make sure to thaw them completely before cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcrowd the Pan:</strong> Frying too many shrimp at once can lower the oil temperature, resulting in less crispy shrimp. Fry in small batches for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor the Oil Temperature:</strong> Use a kitchen thermometer to keep the oil at the optimal temperature. If the oil is too hot, the coating will burn; if it’s too cool, the shrimp will absorb too much oil and become greasy.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Seasonings:</strong> Feel free to customize the seasoning blend to suit your taste. Adding a bit of cayenne pepper or smoked paprika can give the shrimp a nice kick.</li>
    </ul>
