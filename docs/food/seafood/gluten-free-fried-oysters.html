    <li><strong>Coat the Oysters:</strong> Dredge each oyster in the flour mixture, then dip it into the egg mixture, and finally coat it with breadcrumbs. Ensure each oyster is evenly coated.</li>
    <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong> In a deep skillet or fryer, heat oil to 350°F (175°C). Make sure the oil is hot enough to achieve a crispy crust.</li>
