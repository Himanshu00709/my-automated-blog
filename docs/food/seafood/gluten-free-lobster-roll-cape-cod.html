    <h1>Gluten-Free Lobster Roll on Cape Cod: A Culinary Delight</h1>
    <p>When it comes to iconic New England cuisine, few dishes are as beloved as the lobster roll. This classic sandwich, typically served on a buttered, toasted hot dog bun, is a staple of coastal dining. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a traditional lobster roll can be a challenge. Enter the gluten-free lobster roll—a delicious and inclusive twist on this regional favorite. Cape Cod, with its rich maritime heritage and abundant seafood, is the perfect place to savor this gluten-free delicacy.</p>

    <h2>The Rise of Gluten-Free Dining</h2>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has surged, driven by increased awareness of celiac disease and gluten intolerance. Restaurants across Cape Cod have responded by offering gluten-free versions of their most popular dishes, including the lobster roll. These adaptations ensure that everyone can enjoy the flavors of the Cape, regardless of dietary restrictions.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Lobster Roll?</h2>
    <p>A great gluten-free lobster roll starts with the lobster itself. Fresh, succulent lobster meat is the star of the dish, and Cape Cod is renowned for its high-quality, sustainably sourced lobster. The meat is typically mixed with a light dressing—often a combination of mayonnaise, lemon juice, and seasonings—to enhance its natural sweetness without overpowering it.</p>
    <p>The key difference in a gluten-free lobster roll lies in the bread. Traditional hot dog buns are replaced with gluten-free alternatives, which can range from specially formulated gluten-free buns to lettuce wraps for a low-carb option. The best gluten-free buns are soft yet sturdy enough to hold the lobster filling without falling apart.</p>
