    <h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Candy: A Sweet Guide for Everyone</h1>
    <p>For those with dietary restrictions, finding delicious treats that align with your needs can be a challenge. Whether you're gluten-intolerant, lactose-intolerant, or simply avoiding these ingredients for health reasons, the world of candy doesn't have to be off-limits. In fact, there's a growing market for gluten and dairy-free candies that cater to everyone. This guide will explore the best options, what to look for, and how to enjoy sweets without compromising your dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten and Dairy-Free Candy Matters</h2>
    <p>Gluten and dairy are common allergens and intolerances that affect millions of people worldwide. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe reactions in those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Dairy, on the other hand, contains lactose, which many people struggle to digest. For these individuals, consuming gluten or dairy can lead to discomfort, digestive issues, and even long-term health problems. Fortunately, the candy industry has recognized this need and has developed a variety of gluten and dairy-free options that are just as delicious as their traditional counterparts.</p>

    <h2>Popular Gluten and Dairy-Free Candy Brands</h2>
