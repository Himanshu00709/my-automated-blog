<h1>Gluten and Sugar-Free Candy: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free and sugar-free products has skyrocketed, driven by increasing awareness of dietary restrictions and health-conscious consumers. Among these products, gluten and sugar-free candies have gained significant popularity. Whether you're managing celiac disease, diabetes, or simply looking to reduce your sugar intake, these candies offer a guilt-free way to satisfy your sweet tooth. In this article, we'll explore the world of gluten and sugar-free candies, their benefits, popular options, and how to choose the best ones for your needs.</p>

<h2>What Are Gluten and Sugar-Free Candies?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free candies are those that do not contain gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. These candies are essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, as consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues. On the other hand, sugar-free candies are made without traditional sugars like sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup. Instead, they use alternative sweeteners such as stevia, erythritol, or monk fruit extract. Combining these two attributes, gluten and sugar-free candies cater to a wide range of dietary needs, making them a versatile option for many.</p>

    <li><strong>Improved Digestion:</strong> For those with gluten intolerance, these candies can prevent digestive discomfort and other related symptoms.</li>
