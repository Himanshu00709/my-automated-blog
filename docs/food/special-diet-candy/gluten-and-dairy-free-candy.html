    <h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Candy: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with dietary restrictions, finding delicious and safe treats can be a challenge. Gluten and dairy-free candies have become increasingly popular as more people are diagnosed with celiac disease, lactose intolerance, or simply choose to avoid these ingredients for health reasons. In this article, we will explore the world of gluten and dairy-free candy, including what to look for, popular brands, and how to enjoy these treats without compromising on taste or health.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Dairy-Free Diets</h2>

    <p>Before diving into the world of gluten and dairy-free candies, it's important to understand what these terms mean. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, which can cause adverse reactions in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Dairy, on the other hand, refers to products derived from milk, which can be problematic for those with lactose intolerance or a milk allergy.</p>

    <p>For those who need to avoid gluten and dairy, it's crucial to read labels carefully. Many candies contain hidden sources of these ingredients, such as malt flavoring (which contains gluten) or milk chocolate (which contains dairy). Fortunately, there are many brands that cater to these dietary needs, offering a wide range of gluten and dairy-free options.</p>
