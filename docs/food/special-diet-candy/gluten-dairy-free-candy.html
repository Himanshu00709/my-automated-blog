    <h1>Gluten and Dairy-Free Candy: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with dietary restrictions, finding delicious and safe treats can be a challenge. Whether you're avoiding gluten due to celiac disease or steering clear of dairy because of lactose intolerance or a milk allergy, the world of candy can seem like a minefield.
