    <h1>Gluten-Free Vegan Candy: A Sweet Guide for Health-Conscious Treat Lovers</h1>
    <p>For those who follow a gluten-free and vegan lifestyle, finding delicious candy that aligns with dietary restrictions can be a challenge. However, the growing demand for inclusive treats has led to a surge in gluten-free vegan candy options. Whether you're managing celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or simply embracing a plant-based diet, this guide will help you navigate the world of gluten-free vegan candy. From understanding what makes candy gluten-free and vegan to discovering the best brands and recipes, we’ve got you covered.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Candy Gluten-Free and Vegan?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free vegan candy is free from gluten-containing ingredients and animal-derived products. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, which can cause adverse reactions in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Vegan candy, on the other hand, excludes ingredients like gelatin, dairy, and honey, which are derived from animals. Instead, these candies rely on plant-based alternatives such as agar-agar, coconut milk, and natural sweeteners like maple syrup or agave nectar.</p>

    <h2>Popular Types of Gluten-Free Vegan Candy</h2>
    <p>There’s a wide variety of gluten-free vegan candies available, ranging from chocolates to gummies and hard candies. Here are some popular options:</p>
