    <h1>Gluten-Free and Nut-Free Candy: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with dietary restrictions, finding safe and delicious treats can be a challenge. Gluten-free and nut-free candies are becoming increasingly popular as more people are diagnosed with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or nut allergies. This guide will explore the world of gluten-free and nut-free candies, offering insights into what to look for, popular brands, and how to enjoy these treats safely.</p>

    <h2>How to Identify Safe Gluten-Free and Nut-Free Candies</h2>

    <p>When shopping for gluten-free and nut-free candies, it's essential to read labels carefully. Look for certifications such as "Certified Gluten-Free" or "Nut-Free Facility" to ensure the product meets safety standards. Additionally, be aware of cross-contamination risks, especially in facilities that process both gluten-containing and nut-containing products. Some candies may be naturally gluten-free and nut-free but could still be processed in facilities that handle allergens, so always check the packaging for warnings.</p>

From chocolate truffles to gummy bears, making your own candy allows you to control the ingredients and ensure they meet your dietary needs. Here are a few simple recipes to try:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chocolate Truffles:</strong> Made with gluten-free cocoa powder, coconut oil, and a touch of honey, these truffles are rich and satisfying.</li>
        <li><strong>Gummy Bears:</strong> Using gelatin, fruit juice, and a natural sweetener, you can create your own gummy bears at home.</li>
        <li><strong>Peanut-Free Peanut Butter Cups:</strong> Substitute sunflower seed butter for peanut butter to create a nut-free version of this classic treat.</li>
    </ul>
