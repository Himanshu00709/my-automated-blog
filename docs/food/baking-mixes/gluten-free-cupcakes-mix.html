    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for Baking Perfect Gluten-Free Cupcakes</h2>

    <p>While gluten-free cupcake mixes are designed to be user-friendly, there are a few tips and tricks that can help you achieve the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Follow the Instructions:</strong> Always read and follow the instructions on the package carefully. Gluten-free baking can be more sensitive to variations in mixing and baking times.</li>
