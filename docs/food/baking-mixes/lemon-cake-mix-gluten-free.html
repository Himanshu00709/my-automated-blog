    <h1>Gluten-Free Lemon Cake Mix: A Delicious and Healthy Option</h1>
    <p>When it comes to baking, few flavors are as refreshing and versatile as lemon. Whether you're making a zesty dessert for a summer picnic or a comforting treat for a cozy evening, lemon cake is always a crowd-pleaser.

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free baking has come a long way. Modern gluten-free flours and mixes are designed to mimic the texture and taste of traditional baked goods, ensuring that your lemon cake is just as moist, fluffy, and flavorful as its gluten-containing counterpart. With the right mix, you can create a cake that no one will believe is gluten-free!</p>

    <h2>How to Make the Perfect Gluten-Free Lemon Cake</h2>
    <p>Baking a gluten-free lemon cake is easier than you might think, especially when using a pre-made mix. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you achieve the perfect result:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to the temperature specified on the cake mix package. This ensures even baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Your Pan:</strong> Grease your cake pan with butter or a gluten-free cooking spray, and dust it with a light layer of gluten-free flour to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Ingredients:</strong> Follow the instructions on the cake mix package. Typically, you’ll need to add wet ingredients like eggs, oil, and water to the dry mix. Whisk until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Extra Flavor:</strong> For an extra burst of lemon flavor, consider adding fresh lemon zest or a splash of lemon juice to the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for the recommended time. Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center; it should come out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack. Once completely cool, slice and serve with your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
