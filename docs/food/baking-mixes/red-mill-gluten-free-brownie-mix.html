<h2>How to Bake the Perfect Gluten-Free Brownies</h2>

<p>Baking with Red Mill Gluten Free Brownie Mix is straightforward, but there are a few tips and tricks to ensure your brownies turn out perfectly every time:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong> Always preheat your oven to the recommended temperature (usually 350°F) before baking. This ensures even cooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Use the Right Pan:</strong> A 9x9-inch baking pan is ideal for this mix. For thicker brownies, you can use an 8x8-inch pan, but you’ll need to adjust the baking time accordingly.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense, tough brownies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Extras:</strong> Feel free to add your favorite mix-ins, such as nuts, chocolate chips, or dried fruit, to customize your brownies.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Brownies are done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Avoid overbaking, as this can dry out the brownies.</li>
</ol>
