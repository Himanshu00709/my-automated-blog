    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Monster Cookies</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free monster cookies is a straightforward process, especially if you're using a pre-made mix. Here’s a simple step-by-step guide to help you create these delicious treats:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven</strong> to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the dough</strong> by mixing the gluten-free monster cookie mix with wet ingredients like eggs, butter (or a dairy-free alternative), and vanilla extract. Stir until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add mix-ins</strong> such as chocolate chips, M&M's, or any other desired ingredients. Fold them into the dough evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop the dough</strong> onto the prepared baking sheet using a cookie scoop or spoon. Leave enough space between each cookie to allow for spreading.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong> for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may still look slightly undercooked, but they will firm up as they cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool</strong> the cookies on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
