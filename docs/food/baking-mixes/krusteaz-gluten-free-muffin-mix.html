<h2>How to Use Krusteaz Gluten-Free Muffin Mix</h2>

<p>Using Krusteaz Gluten-Free Muffin Mix is straightforward, but there are a few tips and tricks to ensure the best results:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong> Always preheat your oven to the recommended temperature (usually 400Â°F) before baking. This ensures even cooking and helps the muffins rise properly.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix Thoroughly:</strong> Combine the mix with the required wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Overmixing can lead to dense muffins.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Mix-Ins:</strong> Feel free to customize your muffins by adding mix-ins like fresh berries, chocolate chips, or nuts. Fold them into the batter gently to avoid overmixing.</li>
    <li><strong>Use a Muffin Pan:</strong> For best results, use a muffin pan lined with paper liners or lightly greased. This prevents sticking and makes cleanup easier.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake to Perfection:</strong> Bake the muffins for the recommended time (usually 15-18 minutes) or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
</ol>
