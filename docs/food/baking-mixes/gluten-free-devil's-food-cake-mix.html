    <h2>How to Bake the Perfect Gluten-Free Devil's Food Cake</h2>

    <p>Baking a gluten-free devil's food cake is similar to baking a traditional cake, but there are a few key tips to ensure success:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Follow the Instructions:</strong> Always read the instructions on the cake mix package carefully. Gluten-free baking often requires specific steps to achieve the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Ingredients like eggs and butter should be at room temperature to ensure even mixing and a smooth batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Use a toothpick or cake tester to check if the cake is done. It should come out with a few moist crumbs but not wet batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it Cool:</strong> Allow the cake to cool completely before frosting or serving. This helps the cake set and makes it easier to handle.</li>
    </ol>
