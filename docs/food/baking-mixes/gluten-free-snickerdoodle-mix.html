    <h2>How to Use Gluten-Free Snickerdoodle Mix</h2>
    <p>Using a gluten-free snickerdoodle mix is straightforward, but there are a few tips and tricks to ensure your cookies turn out perfectly. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to the temperature specified on the mix’s packaging, usually around 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Follow the instructions on the mix to prepare the dough. This typically involves adding wet ingredients like butter, eggs, and vanilla extract to the dry mix.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Cookies:</strong> Roll the dough into small balls, then roll each ball in a mixture of cinnamon and sugar to coat them evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the coated dough balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving enough space between them to allow for spreading. Bake for the recommended time, usually 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your delicious gluten-free snickerdoodles!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Snickerdoodles</h2>
    <p>While using a mix simplifies the process, there are still a few things you can do to ensure your gluten-free snickerdoodles turn out perfectly:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Make sure your butter and eggs are at room temperature before mixing. This helps create a smoother dough and ensures even baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky to handle, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before shaping the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch the Baking Time:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can bake faster than traditional ones, so keep an eye on them to prevent overbaking.</li>
    </ul>
