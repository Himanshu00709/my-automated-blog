<h2>How to Bake the Perfect Red Velvet Gluten-Free Cake</h2>

<p>Baking a gluten-free cake can be a bit different from baking a traditional cake, but with the right techniques, you can achieve a delicious result. Here are some tips for baking the perfect red velvet gluten-free cake:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Follow the Instructions:</strong> Always start by reading the instructions on the cake mix package. Different brands may have slightly different requirements, so it’s important to follow them closely.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Make sure your eggs, butter, and any other wet ingredients are at room temperature before you start mixing. This helps to create a smoother batter and a more even bake.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix the batter just until the ingredients are combined, and then stop.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can sometimes bake faster than traditional cakes, so keep an eye on your cake as it bakes. Use a toothpick or cake tester to check for doneness—if it comes out clean, the cake is ready.</li>
    <li><strong>Let it Cool:</strong> Allow the cake to cool completely before frosting or serving. This helps to set the structure and makes it easier to handle.</li>
</ol>
