    <h2>How to Use Krusteaz Muffin Mix Gluten-Free</h2>

    <p>Using Krusteaz Muffin Mix Gluten-Free is straightforward, but here are some tips to ensure the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong> Always preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the package (usually 400Â°F).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Muffin Tin:</strong> Grease the muffin tin or use paper liners to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Ingredients:</strong> Combine the muffin mix with the required wet ingredients (water, oil, and eggs or substitutes) in a bowl. Stir until just combined; overmixing can result in dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the Muffin Cups:</strong> Spoon the batter into the muffin cups, filling each about two-thirds full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for the recommended time (usually 18-20 minutes). Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center of a muffin; it should come out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
