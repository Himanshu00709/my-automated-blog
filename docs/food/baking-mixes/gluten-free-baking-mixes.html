<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Baking Mixes</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Are gluten-free baking mixes healthier than regular baking mixes?</h3>
    <p>Not necessarily. While gluten-free baking mixes are essential for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, they are not inherently healthier than regular baking mixes. Some gluten-free mixes may contain higher levels of sugar, fat, or additives to mimic the texture of gluten-containing products. Always check the nutritional information and ingredient list to make an informed choice.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I substitute gluten-free baking mixes in any recipe?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free baking mixes are designed to replace wheat flour in specific types of recipes, such as bread, cakes, or cookies. However, they may not work well in all recipes, especially those that rely heavily on gluten for structure, like traditional yeast bread. It’s best to use a mix that is specifically formulated for the type of baked good you are making.</p>

    <h3>3. Do gluten-free baking mixes taste different?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free baking mixes can have a slightly different taste and texture compared to traditional baking mixes, but many high-quality mixes are designed to closely mimic the flavor and texture of gluten-containing products. The taste can also vary depending on the type of flours and starches used in the mix.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I make my own gluten-free baking mix at home?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can create your own gluten-free baking mix by combining different gluten-free flours and starches, such as rice flour, almond flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch.
