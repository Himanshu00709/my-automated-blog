    <h1>Exploring Gluten-Free Ethiopian Cuisine</h1>
    <p>Ethiopian cuisine is a treasure trove of flavors, textures, and aromas that have captivated food lovers around the world. Known for its communal dining style and unique use of spices, Ethiopian food is not only delicious but also inherently gluten-free in many of its traditional dishes.

Additionally, Ethiopian dishes are often rich in legumes, vegetables, and spices, further enhancing their gluten-free appeal.</p>
