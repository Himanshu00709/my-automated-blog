    <h1>Exploring Ethiopian Gluten-Free Cuisine</h1>
    <p>Ethiopian cuisine is a treasure trove of flavors, textures, and traditions. Known for its rich spices, hearty stews, and communal dining style, Ethiopian food has gained global recognition.

Additionally, Ethiopian dishes are often prepared with fresh vegetables, legumes, and spices, further enhancing their gluten-free appeal.</p>

Teff's versatility allows it to be used in various dishes, from injera to porridge. Its slightly nutty flavor and unique texture make it a favorite among gluten-free enthusiasts. Moreover, teff is a sustainable crop, requiring minimal water and thriving in Ethiopia's diverse climates.</p>
