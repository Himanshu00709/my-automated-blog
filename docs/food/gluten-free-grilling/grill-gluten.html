    <h1>Understanding Grill Gluten: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Grill gluten, often referred to as seitan, is a popular meat substitute made from wheat gluten. It has gained significant attention in recent years, especially among vegetarians, vegans, and those looking to reduce their meat consumption. This article delves into the intricacies of grill gluten, exploring its nutritional profile, culinary uses, and potential health benefits and drawbacks.</p>

    <h2>What is Grill Gluten?</h2>
    <p>Grill gluten, or seitan, is a protein-rich food made from hydrated wheat gluten, the main protein found in wheat. It is created by washing wheat flour dough with water until all the starch granules have been removed, leaving behind the sticky, insoluble gluten. The resulting product is then cooked, often by boiling, steaming, or baking, to create a chewy, meat-like texture.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Profile of Grill Gluten</h2>
    <p>Grill gluten is highly nutritious, particularly for those seeking a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet. Below is a breakdown of its nutritional content per 100 grams:</p>
