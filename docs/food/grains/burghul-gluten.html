    <h1>Understanding Burghul and Its Gluten Content</h1>
    <p>Burghul, also known as bulgur, is a whole grain made from cracked wheat that has been parboiled and dried. It is a staple in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines, known for its nutty flavor and versatility in dishes like tabbouleh, pilafs, and salads.
