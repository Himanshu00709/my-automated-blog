<h1>Gluten-Free Matzo for Passover: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Passover, or Pesach, is one of the most significant Jewish holidays, commemorating the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. Central to the Passover celebration is the Seder meal, during which matzo, or unleavened bread, is consumed. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding gluten-free matzo can be a challenge. This guide will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free matzo for Passover, including its history, preparation, and where to find it.</p>

<h2>The Significance of Matzo in Passover</h2>

<p>Matzo holds a special place in the Passover tradition. According to the Torah, the Israelites left Egypt in such haste that they did not have time to let their bread rise. As a result, they baked unleavened bread, which became known as matzo. During Passover, leavened products, or chametz, are strictly prohibited, making matzo the only bread product allowed.</p>

<p>For those who must avoid gluten, traditional matzo made from wheat is not an option. This has led to the development of gluten-free matzo, which adheres to the dietary restrictions of Passover while accommodating those with gluten-related disorders.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten-Free Matzo?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free matzo is made from alternative flours that do not contain gluten, such as oat, rice, or quinoa flour. These flours are carefully processed to ensure they meet the strict Passover guidelines, which include being free from chametz and kitniyot (legumes, rice, and corn, which are traditionally avoided by Ashkenazi Jews during Passover).</p>

<p>Gluten-free matzo must also be baked within 18 minutes to prevent fermentation, a key requirement for all matzo during Passover. This ensures that the matzo remains unleavened and kosher for Passover.</p>

<h2>Types of Gluten-Free Matzo</h2>

<p>There are several types of gluten-free matzo available, each made from different gluten-free grains. Below is a table comparing the most common types:</p>
