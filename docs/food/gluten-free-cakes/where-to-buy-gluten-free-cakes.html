    <h1>Where to Buy Gluten-Free Cakes: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular over the years, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal health choices. For those who love cakes but need to avoid gluten, finding a delicious and safe option can be a challenge. Fortunately, the market for gluten-free cakes has expanded significantly, offering a variety of options for every taste and occasion. In this guide, we’ll explore where to buy gluten-free cakes, what to look for, and how to ensure you’re getting the best quality.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Cakes?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free cakes are made without wheat, barley, rye, or any other gluten-containing ingredients. They are essential for individuals with celiac disease, as even small amounts of gluten can cause severe health issues. Additionally, many people without gluten intolerance choose gluten-free cakes for their perceived health benefits or simply because they enjoy the taste and texture. With advancements in gluten-free baking, these cakes can be just as moist, fluffy, and flavorful as their traditional counterparts.</p>

    <h3>2. Supermarkets</h3>

    <p>Most major supermarkets now have a dedicated gluten-free section, where you can find pre-packaged gluten-free cakes.
