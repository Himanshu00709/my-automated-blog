        <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Cucumbers, bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, carrots, and red onions add color and crunch.</li>
        <li><strong>Protein Sources:</strong> Chickpeas, lentils, quinoa, or tofu are excellent plant-based protein options.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthy Fats:</strong> Avocado, nuts, and seeds like chia or flaxseed provide essential fatty acids.</li>
