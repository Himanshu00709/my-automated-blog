    <h1>Gluten-Free Options at Wendy's: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, fast-food chains like Wendy's have made strides in offering gluten-free options that cater to those with dietary restrictions. In this article, we'll explore the gluten-free menu at Wendy's, discuss cross-contamination risks, and provide tips for safely enjoying your meal.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten can cause discomfort and other symptoms. Therefore, it's crucial for individuals with these conditions to avoid gluten in their diet.</p>

    <h2>Wendy's Gluten-Free Menu Options</h2>
    <p>Wendy's offers a variety of menu items that are naturally gluten-free. However, it's important to note that Wendy's does not have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen, so cross-contamination is a possibility. Here are some of the gluten-free options available:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Menu Item</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Baked Potato</td>
                <td>A classic baked potato with your choice of toppings like sour cream, chives, and cheese.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Chili</td>
                <td>Wendy's famous chili is gluten-free and can be enjoyed on its own or as a topping for a baked potato.</td>
            </tr>

            </tr>

                <td>Salads (without croutons)</td>
                <td>Several salads are gluten-free when you omit the croutons. Be sure to check the dressing for gluten-containing ingredients.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>
    <p>While Wendy's offers gluten-free options, it's essential to be aware of the risk of cross-contamination. Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods or surfaces. At Wendy's, this could happen during food preparation, cooking, or even when handling utensils. If you have severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, it's crucial to communicate your dietary needs to the staff and ask about their food preparation practices.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Safely Enjoying Gluten-Free at Wendy's</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to help you safely enjoy gluten-free options at Wendy's:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Communicate Your Needs:</strong> Inform the staff about your gluten intolerance or celiac disease. They may be able to take extra precautions to minimize cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Ingredients:</strong> Always double-check the ingredients of menu items, as recipes can change. Wendy's provides allergen information on their website, which can be a helpful resource.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Fried Foods:</strong> Fried foods at Wendy's, such as french fries and chicken nuggets, are typically cooked in shared fryers, which increases the risk of cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt for Simple Choices:</strong> Stick to simple, naturally gluten-free options like baked potatoes, chili, and salads without croutons.</li>
    </ul>
