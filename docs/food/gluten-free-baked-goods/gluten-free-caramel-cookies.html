<h1>Gluten-Free Caramel Cookies: A Delicious Treat for Everyone</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and for good reason. Whether you're managing celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply choosing a gluten-free lifestyle, finding delicious treats that cater to your dietary needs can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free caramel cookies—a delightful combination of rich, buttery dough and gooey caramel that will satisfy your sweet tooth without compromising your health. In this blog post, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free caramel cookies, from their benefits to a step-by-step recipe and FAQs.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Caramel Cookies?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free caramel cookies are more than just a tasty treat; they offer several benefits for those who need or choose to avoid gluten. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. By opting for gluten-free cookies, you can enjoy a delicious dessert without the negative side effects. Additionally, gluten-free baking often incorporates nutrient-dense flours like almond, coconut, or oat flour, which can add extra fiber, protein, and healthy fats to your diet.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Caramel Cookies</h2>

<p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making these irresistible gluten-free caramel cookies.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and ensure even baking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. This ensures that the leavening agents are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the unsalted butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving the perfect cookie texture.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
<p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Make sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined. Overmixing can lead to tough cookies, so be gentle.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Fold in Caramel</h3>
<p>Gently fold in the caramel bits or drizzle caramel sauce into the dough. This will create pockets of gooey caramel throughout the cookies.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Scoop and Bake</h3>
<p>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</p>

<h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free caramel cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Caramel Cookies</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>No, using regular flour will introduce gluten into the recipe, making it unsuitable for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Stick to a certified gluten-free flour blend for the best results.</p>

    <h3>2. How do I store gluten-free caramel cookies?</h3>
    <p>Store your cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a plant-based alternative and use a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) instead of regular eggs. Ensure your caramel is also vegan-friendly.</p>

    <h3>4. Why are my cookies spreading too much?</h3>
    <p>Overly soft butter or too much sugar can cause cookies to spread. Make sure your butter is at the right consistency (soft but not melted) and measure your ingredients accurately.</p>
</div>
