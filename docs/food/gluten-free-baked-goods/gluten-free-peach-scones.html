    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free peach scones is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a batch of delicious, tender scones:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut in the butter:</strong> Add the cold butter pieces to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the honey (or maple syrup), heavy cream (or coconut milk), and vanilla extract. Pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the peaches:</strong> Gently fold in the diced peaches, being careful not to overmix the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a circle about 1 inch thick. Cut the circle into 8 wedges and place them on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the scones for 18-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. Allow them to cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Peach Scones</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free peach scones turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use cold butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for creating a flaky texture in your scones. Make sure your butter is straight from the fridge.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough scones. Mix the dough just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose ripe peaches:</strong> Ripe peaches are sweeter and juicier, which will enhance the flavor of your scones.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flours:</strong> Feel free to experiment with different gluten-free flours to find the texture and flavor you prefer.</li>
    </ul>
