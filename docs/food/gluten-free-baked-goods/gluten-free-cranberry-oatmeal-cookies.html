    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free cranberry oatmeal cookies is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create your own batch of delicious cookies:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter (or coconut oil) and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Oats and Cranberries:</strong> Stir in the gluten-free oats and dried cranberries until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Cookies:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may still look slightly underbaked, but they will firm up as they cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free cranberry oatmeal cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</li>
    </ol>
