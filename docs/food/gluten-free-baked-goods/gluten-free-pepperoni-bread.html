    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and olive oil. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms. If the dough feels too sticky, add a bit more flour.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Fillings</h3>
    <p>Fold in the pepperoni slices, shredded mozzarella cheese, and Italian seasoning into the dough. Make sure the fillings are evenly distributed for maximum flavor in every bite.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape and Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer the dough to a greased baking sheet and shape it into a loaf. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the bread to cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing. Serve warm with marinara sauce for dipping, or enjoy it on its own.</p>
