    <h1>Gluten-Free Protein Cinnamon Rolls: A Healthy Twist on a Classic Treat</h1>

    <p>Cinnamon rolls are a beloved indulgence, but for those with dietary restrictions or health-conscious goals, traditional recipes can be off-limits. Enter gluten-free protein cinnamon rolls—a delicious and nutritious alternative that doesn’t compromise on flavor or texture. Whether you’re gluten-intolerant, following a high-protein diet, or simply looking for a healthier treat, these cinnamon rolls are a game-changer. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free protein cinnamon rolls, provide a step-by-step recipe, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Protein Cinnamon Rolls?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free protein cinnamon rolls are more than just a dietary alternative; they’re a smart choice for anyone looking to enjoy a sweet treat without the guilt.

    <p>Gluten-free baking has come a long way, and modern recipes use nutrient-dense flours like almond, coconut, or oat flour. These flours not only provide a gluten-free base but also add fiber, healthy fats, and essential vitamins. Additionally, incorporating protein powder into the dough or filling boosts the nutritional profile, making these cinnamon rolls a satisfying snack or post-workout treat.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the recipe. Follow these steps to create your own gluten-free protein cinnamon rolls:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of gluten-free flour, 1 scoop of protein powder, 1 teaspoon of xanthan gum, and a pinch of salt. Mix well. Add 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk, 2 tablespoons of melted coconut oil, and 1 egg (or flax egg). Stir until a dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and roll it into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread a thin layer of softened butter or coconut oil over the dough, then sprinkle a mixture of cinnamon, coconut sugar, and nutmeg evenly across the surface.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Roll and Cut</h3>
    <p>Carefully roll the dough into a tight log, starting from one of the longer sides. Use a sharp knife to cut the log into 8-10 equal slices. Place the slices in a greased baking dish, leaving a little space between each roll.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through. While the rolls are baking, prepare the frosting by mixing Greek yogurt or coconut cream with a bit of vanilla extract and sweetener of your choice.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Frost and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the cinnamon rolls are out of the oven, let them cool for a few minutes before spreading the frosting over the top. Serve warm and enjoy!</p>

        <h3>2. Are these cinnamon rolls suitable for vegans?</h3>
