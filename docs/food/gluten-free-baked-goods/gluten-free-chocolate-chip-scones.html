<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the scones from sticking and make cleanup easier.</p>

<h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in your scones.</p>

<h3>3. Cut in the Butter</h3>
<p>Add the cold, cubed butter to the dry ingredients. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. This step is crucial for achieving the flaky texture that scones are known for.</p>

<h3>4. Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, egg, and vanilla extract. Pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to tough scones.</p>

<h3>5. Fold in Chocolate Chips</h3>
<p>Gently fold in the chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the dough. This will give you a burst of chocolate in every bite.</p>

<h3>6. Shape and Cut</h3>
<p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a circle about 1 inch thick. Cut the circle into 8 wedges, like you would a pizza. Alternatively, you can use a round cutter to create individual scones.</p>

<h3>7. Bake</h3>
<p>Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. Allow them to cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Scones</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free scones can be a bit different from traditional scones, but with a few tips, you can achieve perfect results every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Cold Ingredients:</strong> Cold butter and cream are essential for creating flaky scones. If the butter melts before baking, the scones will lose their texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to dense scones. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the Dough Rest:</strong> Allowing the dough to rest for 10-15 minutes before baking can help the gluten-free flours absorb the liquid, resulting in a better texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> While chocolate chips are a classic choice, you can also add dried fruit, nuts, or even citrus zest to customize your scones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Scones</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or oat flour. However, keep in mind that each flour has a different texture and absorption rate, so you may need to adjust the amount of liquid in the recipe.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I make these scones dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the heavy cream with a dairy-free alternative like coconut cream or almond milk. Similarly, use dairy-free butter and chocolate chips to make the scones completely dairy-free.</p>

    <h3>3. How should I store gluten-free scones?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free scones are best enjoyed fresh, but you can store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, freeze the scones and reheat them in the oven when ready to eat.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I add other mix-ins besides chocolate chips?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can customize your scones with a variety of mix-ins like dried fruit, nuts, or even spices like cinnamon or nutmeg. Just be sure to keep the total amount of mix-ins to about 3/4 cup to maintain the right dough consistency.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free chocolate chip scones are a delightful treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and techniques, you can create scones that are just as flaky, tender, and delicious as traditional ones. Whether you’re new to gluten-free baking or a seasoned pro, this recipe is sure to become a favorite in your household.
