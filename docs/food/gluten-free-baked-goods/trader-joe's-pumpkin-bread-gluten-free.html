    <h2>How to Bake the Perfect Loaf</h2>

    <p>Baking Trader Joe's Pumpkin Bread Gluten-Free is a straightforward process, but there are a few tips and tricks to ensure your loaf turns out perfectly every time. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your bread bakes evenly and rises properly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Your Pan:</strong> Grease your loaf pan with a bit of oil or butter, or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the pumpkin bread mix with the required wet ingredients (usually eggs, oil, and water). Mix until just combined—overmixing can lead to a dense loaf.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For an extra touch of indulgence, consider adding a cream cheese glaze or a sprinkle of chopped nuts on top before serving. These additions can elevate the flavor and texture of your pumpkin bread, making it even more irresistible.</p>
