    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free cranberry orange cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the wet ingredients:</strong> Beat in the egg, followed by the orange zest, orange juice, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the cranberries:</strong> Gently fold in the dried cranberries until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined to ensure a tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough if needed:</strong> If your dough is too sticky, chilling it for 15-30 minutes can make it easier to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust baking time:</strong> Gluten-free cookies may require slightly less or more baking time than traditional cookies. Keep an eye on them to avoid overbaking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh cranberries instead of dried?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh cranberries, but keep in mind that they have a higher moisture content, which may affect the texture of the cookies. If using fresh cranberries, chop them finely and consider reducing the amount of orange juice slightly to balance the moisture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or a plant-based butter. Just make sure it's softened to room temperature before creaming with the sugar.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months. Simply thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts to this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, nuts like chopped walnuts or pecans would be a great addition to these cookies. Add about 1/2 cup of chopped nuts when you fold in the cranberries.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Gluten-free cranberry orange cookies are a delightful treat that combines the festive flavors of cranberries and orange in a soft, chewy cookie. Whether you're baking for a holiday gathering or simply indulging in a sweet snack, these cookies are sure to please. With simple ingredients and easy-to-follow instructions, this recipe is perfect for both novice and experienced bakers.
