    <h1>Gluten-Free Blackberry Scones: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>When it comes to breakfast or a mid-afternoon snack, scones are a classic choice. But for those who follow a gluten-free diet, traditional scones can be off-limits. Enter gluten-free blackberry scones—a delightful, healthy alternative that doesn’t compromise on flavor or texture. In this blog post, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free baking, provide a step-by-step recipe for making these scones, and answer some frequently asked questions about gluten-free scones.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Scones?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals looking to improve their overall health. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and inflammation in some people. By opting for gluten-free scones, you can enjoy a delicious treat without the negative side effects.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free baking often incorporates nutrient-dense flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or oat flour, which can add extra fiber, protein, and healthy fats to your diet. Blackberries, the star ingredient in these scones, are packed with antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, making this recipe a wholesome choice.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Incorporate the Butter</h3>
    <p>Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. This step is crucial for achieving the perfect scone texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, egg, and vanilla extract. Pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and gently stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough scones.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fold in the Blackberries</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the fresh blackberries into the dough. If the blackberries are large, you can cut them in half to distribute them more evenly. Be gentle to avoid crushing the berries.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Shape and Cut</h3>
    <p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a circle about 1 inch thick. Cut the circle into 8 wedges and place them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each scone.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the scones in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. Allow them to cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Blackberry Scones</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen blackberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blackberries if fresh ones are not available. However, be sure to keep them frozen until you’re ready to fold them into the dough to prevent them from bleeding too much.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these scones dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the heavy cream with a dairy-free alternative like coconut cream, and use a dairy-free butter substitute. The texture may vary slightly, but the scones will still be delicious.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free scones?</h3>
        <p>Store the scones in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 3 months. Simply reheat in the oven before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute blackberries with other fruits like blueberries, raspberries, or even diced apples. Just be mindful of the moisture content, as some fruits may require slight adjustments to the dough.</p>
    </div>

With their tender crumb, sweet-tart blackberries, and wholesome ingredients, these scones are perfect for breakfast, brunch, or a midday snack.
