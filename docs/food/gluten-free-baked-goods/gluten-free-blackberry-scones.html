    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free blackberry scones:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps.</p>

    <h3>3. Cut in the Butter</h3>
    <p>Add the cold, cubed butter to the dry ingredients. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. This step is crucial for achieving the flaky texture that scones are known for.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, egg, and vanilla extract. Pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and gently stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough scones.</p>

    <h3>5. Fold in the Blackberries</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the fresh blackberries into the dough. If you’re using frozen blackberries, do not thaw them beforehand, as this can cause the dough to become too wet.</p>

    <h3>6. Shape and Cut</h3>
    <p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a circle about 1 inch thick. Cut the circle into 8 wedges, similar to how you would cut a pizza. Alternatively, you can use a round cutter to create individual scones.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each one. Brush the tops with a little extra heavy cream and sprinkle with sugar if desired. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the scones are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>8. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the scones to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm with your favorite jam, clotted cream, or simply enjoy them as they are.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Scones</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free scones can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be well on your way to perfect scones every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Ingredients:</strong> Cold butter and cream are essential for achieving a flaky texture. If the butter melts before baking, the scones will be dense rather than light and airy.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough scones. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Handle the Dough Gently:</strong> When shaping the dough, handle it as little as possible to avoid overworking it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen blackberries?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blackberries. Just make sure to add them to the dough while they are still frozen to prevent the dough from becoming too wet.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these scones dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the heavy cream with a dairy-free alternative like coconut cream, and use a dairy-free butter substitute. The texture may vary slightly, but they will still be delicious.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftover scones?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover scones in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the scones and reheat them in the oven when ready to eat.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other fruits to the scones?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other fruits like blueberries, raspberries, or even diced apples. Just be mindful of the moisture content of the fruit you choose.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free blackberry scones are a wonderful way to enjoy a classic baked good without the gluten. With the right ingredients and a little care, you can create scones that are just as delicious and satisfying as their traditional counterparts. Whether you’re serving them for breakfast, brunch, or as a snack, these scones are sure to be a hit.
