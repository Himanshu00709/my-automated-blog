    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, until a soft dough forms.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>

    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the chopped pecans, brown sugar, and cinnamon. This will be the filling for your pecan rolls. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Rolls</h3>

    <p>Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread the pecan filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Roll the dough tightly from one end to the other, forming a log. Cut the log into 12 equal slices and place them in a greased baking dish.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake and Serve</h3>

    <p>Bake the rolls in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through. Allow them to cool slightly before serving. For an extra touch, you can drizzle a simple glaze made from powdered sugar and milk over the top.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pecan Rolls</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of nut?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute pecans with walnuts, almonds, or any other nut of your choice. Just make sure to chop them finely for the filling.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these rolls ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the rolls up to the point of baking, cover them tightly, and refrigerate overnight. When you’re ready to bake, simply let them come to room temperature and bake as directed.</p>

        <h3>Are gluten-free pecan rolls suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe contains eggs and butter, so it’s not vegan. However, you can make it vegan by using a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) and a plant-based butter substitute.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover pecan rolls?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover rolls in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 3 months. Just reheat in the oven before serving.</p>
    </div>
