<h2>What is Rugelach?</h2>

<p>Rugelach is a crescent-shaped pastry that originated in Eastern Europe.

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Rugelach</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free rugelach is a straightforward process, but it does require some attention to detail to ensure that the dough comes out just right. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating your own gluten-free rugelach:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and a pinch of salt. In a separate bowl, beat the cream cheese and butter until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Divide the dough into two equal portions, wrap each in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Roll Out the Dough</h3>

<p>Once the dough has chilled, roll out one portion on a lightly floured surface (using gluten-free flour) into a circle about 1/8 inch thick. Spread your chosen filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Cut the dough into 8-12 wedges, like a pizza.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Shape the Rugelach</h3>

<p>Starting from the wide end of each wedge, roll the dough towards the point to form a crescent shape. Place the shaped rugelach on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving some space between each piece.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Bake</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Brush the rugelach with an egg wash (a beaten egg mixed with a little water) and sprinkle with sugar if desired. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the rugelach are golden brown. Allow them to cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Rugelach</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Chilling the dough before rolling it out is crucial for achieving the right texture. It helps prevent the dough from becoming too sticky and makes it easier to handle.</li>
    <li><strong>Use a Good Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking and contains xanthan gum or another binding agent.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Fillings:</strong> While traditional rugelach fillings include jam, nuts, and chocolate, don't be afraid to get creative. Try using different types of fruit preserves, nut butters, or even savory fillings like cheese and herbs.</li>
</ul>
