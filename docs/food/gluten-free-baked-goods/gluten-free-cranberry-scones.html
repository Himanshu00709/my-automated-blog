    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the sugar and dried cranberries.</p>

    <h3>2. Mixing the Wet Ingredients</h3>

    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, egg, and vanilla extract. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough scones.</p>

    <h3>3. Shaping and Baking</h3>

    <p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a few times to bring it together. Pat the dough into a circle about 1 inch thick and cut it into 8 wedges. Place the wedges on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving some space between each scone. Brush the tops with a little extra cream and sprinkle with sugar if desired. Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until the scones are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Scones</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Ingredients:</strong> Keeping the butter and cream cold ensures that the scones will be flaky and tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to dense scones. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add other ingredients like orange zest, nuts, or chocolate chips to customize your scones.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Can I use fresh cranberries instead of dried?</h3>

    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these scones dairy-free?</h3>

    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store gluten-free cranberry scones?</h3>
        <p>Store the scones in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, freeze the scones and reheat them in the oven when ready to serve.</p>
