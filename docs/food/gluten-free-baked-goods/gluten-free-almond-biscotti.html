<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, vanilla extract, and almond extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
    <li><strong>Fold in Almonds:</strong> Gently fold in the sliced almonds until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
    <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Divide the dough in half and shape each portion into a log about 12 inches long and 2 inches wide. Place the logs on the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between them.</li>
    <li><strong>First Bake:</strong> Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the logs are firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Slice the Biscotti:</strong> Using a sharp knife, slice the logs diagonally into 1/2-inch thick slices. Place the slices cut-side down on the baking sheet.</li>
    <li><strong>Second Bake:</strong> Bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the biscotti are golden and crisp.</li>
