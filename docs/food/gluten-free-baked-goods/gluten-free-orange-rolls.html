    <h1>Gluten-Free Orange Rolls: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular as more people discover the benefits of a gluten-free diet, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply a desire for healthier eating. Among the many gluten-free recipes available, gluten-free orange rolls stand out as a delightful treat that combines the zesty flavor of oranges with the comforting texture of soft, fluffy rolls. In this article, we’ll explore the art of making gluten-free orange rolls, from selecting the right ingredients to mastering the baking process.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Orange Rolls?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free orange rolls are not only a delicious alternative to traditional baked goods but also a healthier option for those who need to avoid gluten. The absence of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, makes these rolls easier to digest for individuals with gluten-related disorders. Additionally, the use of fresh orange zest and juice adds a burst of citrus flavor that enhances the overall taste and nutritional value of the rolls.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Orange Rolls</h2>

    <p>To make gluten-free orange rolls, you’ll need a combination of gluten-free flours, leavening agents, and flavorings. Here’s a list of essential ingredients:</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by activating the yeast. In a small bowl, combine the warm milk (around 110°F) with the yeast and a pinch of sugar. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, sugar, and salt. Add the activated yeast mixture, melted butter, egg, orange zest, and orange juice. Mix until a soft dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add a bit more flour, but be careful not to overmix.</p>

    <h3>2. Let the Dough Rise</h3>

    <p>Once the dough is ready, cover it with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size. Gluten-free dough may not rise as much as traditional dough, but it should still increase in volume.</p>

    <h3>3. Shape the Rolls</h3>

    <p>After the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll it into a rectangle about ¼ inch thick. Spread a thin layer of softened butter over the dough, then sprinkle with a mixture of sugar and orange zest. Roll the dough tightly into a log, then cut it into 12 equal pieces. Place the rolls in a greased baking dish, leaving some space between each roll to allow for expansion.</p>

    <h3>4. Second Rise and Baking</h3>

    <p>Cover the rolls with a towel and let them rise for another 30 minutes. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Once the rolls have risen, bake them for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Orange Rolls</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, such as almond flour, coconut flour, or a pre-made gluten-free flour mix. However, keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary depending on the flour used.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these rolls dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the milk and butter with your favorite non-dairy alternatives, such as almond milk and vegan butter.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free orange rolls?</h3>
        <p>Store the rolls in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 2 months. Simply reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add a glaze to the rolls?</h3>
        <p>Yes, a simple glaze made from powdered sugar and orange juice can be drizzled over the warm rolls for added sweetness and flavor.</p>
    </div>
