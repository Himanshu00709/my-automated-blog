    <h1>Gluten-Free Potato Rolls: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of gluten intolerance and celiac disease. Among the many gluten-free options available, potato rolls have emerged as a popular choice for those seeking a delicious and healthy alternative to traditional bread. Made with potato flour or mashed potatoes, these rolls are not only gluten-free but also incredibly soft, moist, and flavorful. In this article, we will explore the benefits of gluten-free potato rolls, how to make them at home, and why they are a great addition to your diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Potato Rolls?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free potato rolls are a type of bread made without wheat or other gluten-containing grains. Instead, they are primarily made from potato flour, mashed potatoes, or a combination of both. These rolls are naturally gluten-free, making them an excellent option for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. The use of potatoes in the dough gives the rolls a unique texture—soft, moist, and slightly chewy—that is often difficult to achieve with other gluten-free flours.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Potato Rolls</h2>
    <p>There are several reasons why gluten-free potato rolls are a great choice for those following a gluten-free diet:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Soft and Moist Texture:</strong> The natural moisture from the potatoes helps keep the rolls soft and fresh for longer periods.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich in Nutrients:</strong> Potatoes are a good source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, potassium, and vitamin B6.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> These rolls can be used in a variety of ways, from sandwiches to dinner rolls, making them a versatile addition to any meal.</li>
        <li><strong>Easy to Digest:</strong> For those with gluten intolerance, potato rolls are easier on the digestive system compared to traditional wheat-based bread.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Cover the rolls with a kitchen towel and let them rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes or until they are golden brown on top.</li>
