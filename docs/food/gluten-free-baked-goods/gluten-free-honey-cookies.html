    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your own batch of gluten-free honey cookies:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the honey, melted coconut oil, eggs, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a cohesive dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Cookies:</strong> Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of dough and roll them into balls. Place them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each cookie.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake, as gluten-free cookies can dry out quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy!</li>
