    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream butter and sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</li>

        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in cranberries:</strong> Gently fold in the dried cranberries until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free orange cranberry cookies with a cup of tea or coffee!</li>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh cranberries instead of dried?</h3>
        <p>While dried cranberries are recommended for this recipe, you can use fresh cranberries if you prefer. Keep in mind that fresh cranberries are more tart and may require additional sugar to balance the flavor.</p>

        <h3>How do I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store your gluten-free orange cranberry cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute the gluten-free flour with almond flour?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour can be used, but it will change the texture of the cookies. Almond flour tends to make cookies denser and moister, so you may need to adjust the baking time accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Are these cookies suitable for diabetics?</h3>
        <p>These cookies contain sugar, so they may not be suitable for diabetics. However, you can substitute the sugar with a diabetic-friendly sweetener like stevia or erythritol to make them more suitable.</p>
