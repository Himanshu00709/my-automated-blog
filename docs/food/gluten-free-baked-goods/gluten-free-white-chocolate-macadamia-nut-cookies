    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create the perfect gluten-free white chocolate macadamia nut cookies:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line your baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cream the Butter and Sugars</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer on medium speed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the vanilla extract until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fold in White Chocolate and Macadamia Nuts</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts using a spatula. Ensure they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers are still soft.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free white chocolate macadamia nut cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</p>
