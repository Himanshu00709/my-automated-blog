    <h1>Gluten-Free Blueberry Lemon Scones: A Delicious Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>When it comes to breakfast or a mid-afternoon snack, few things are as satisfying as a freshly baked scone. But for those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding a delicious and flaky scone can be a challenge. Enter the gluten-free blueberry lemon scone—a delightful combination of tart lemon, sweet blueberries, and a tender, crumbly texture that will make you forget it's gluten-free. In this blog post, we’ll explore the magic of these scones, provide a detailed recipe, and answer some common questions about gluten-free baking.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Blueberry Lemon Scones?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has come a long way in recent years, and with the right ingredients, you can create baked goods that are just as delicious as their gluten-containing counterparts. Blueberry lemon scones are a perfect example of this. The natural sweetness of blueberries pairs beautifully with the zesty tang of lemon, creating a flavor profile that is both refreshing and indulgent. Plus, the gluten-free flour blend ensures that the scones are light and tender, making them a treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions.</p>

    <h2>The Perfect Gluten-Free Flour Blend</h2>
    <p>One of the keys to successful gluten-free baking is using the right flour blend. Unlike traditional wheat flour, gluten-free flours require a combination of different flours and starches to achieve the right texture. Here’s a table of a recommended gluten-free flour blend for scones:</p>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Xanthan Gum</td>

    <p>Now that you have your gluten-free flour blend ready, let’s dive into the recipe. These scones are easy to make and require just a few simple steps. Follow along to create a batch of scones that will impress your family and friends.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend (see table above)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh or frozen blueberries</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>2/3 cup heavy cream (or dairy-free alternative)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the cold, cubed butter to the dry ingredients. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Gently fold in the blueberries and lemon zest, being careful not to crush the berries.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, egg, and vanilla extract. Pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a circle about 1 inch thick. Cut the circle into 8 wedges and place them on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Brush the tops of the scones with a little extra cream and sprinkle with sugar if desired.</li>
        <li>Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until the scones are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the scones to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy with a cup of tea or coffee!</li>
    </ol>
