    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's move on to the step-by-step instructions to make this delicious Gluten-Free Orange Cranberry Bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan with a little oil or line it with parchment paper to prevent the bread from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs lightly. Add the orange zest, fresh orange juice, honey (or maple syrup), and unsweetened applesauce. Mix until all the wet ingredients are well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add Cranberries and Nuts</h3>
    <p>Fold in the dried cranberries and chopped walnuts (if using) into the batter. This will add a delightful texture and flavor to your bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and serve. Enjoy your Gluten-Free Orange Cranberry Bread with a cup of tea or coffee!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh cranberries instead of dried?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh cranberries, but keep in mind that they are more tart than dried cranberries. You may want to adjust the sweetness of the bread by adding a bit more honey or maple syrup if using fresh cranberries.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute almond flour with another type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour adds moisture and a nutty flavor to the bread, but if you have a nut allergy, you can substitute it with another gluten-free flour like coconut flour or oat flour. Keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and freeze it for up to 2 months. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this bread vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this bread vegan by substituting the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and using maple syrup instead of honey. The texture may be slightly different, but it will still be delicious.</p>
