<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

<p>Start by making the gluten-free pastry dough. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum (if needed), granulated sugar, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

<p>Gradually add the ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Once the dough forms a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Apple Filling</h3>

<p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the apple filling. In a medium saucepan, combine the diced apples, brown sugar, ground cinnamon, and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the apples are tender and the mixture has thickened, about 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool completely.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble the Turnovers</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). On a lightly floured surface (using gluten-free flour), roll out the chilled dough to about 1/8-inch thickness. Cut the dough into squares or rectangles, depending on the size of turnovers you want.</p>

<p>Place a spoonful of the cooled apple filling in the center of each dough square. Fold the dough over the filling to form a triangle or rectangle, and press the edges together with a fork to seal. Transfer the turnovers to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

<h3>4. Bake the Turnovers</h3>

<p>In a small bowl, beat the egg and brush it over the tops of the turnovers. This will give them a beautiful golden color when baked. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the turnovers are golden brown and crisp. Allow them to cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Apple Turnovers</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking pastries, as it will give you the best texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep the butter cold:</strong> Cold butter is key to achieving a flaky pastry. If the butter melts before baking, your turnovers may turn out dense rather than light and flaky.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t overfill the turnovers:</strong> While it’s tempting to add more filling, overfilling can cause the turnovers to burst open during baking. Stick to a moderate amount of filling for the best results.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the filling cool:</strong> Adding hot filling to the dough can cause it to become too soft and difficult to work with. Make sure the filling is completely cooled before assembling the turnovers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit for the filling?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! While apple turnovers are a classic, you can experiment with other fruits like peaches, berries, or even pears. Just adjust the sugar and spices accordingly to complement the fruit you choose.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these turnovers ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the turnovers up to the point of baking and then freeze them. When you’re ready to bake, simply place the frozen turnovers on a baking sheet and bake as directed, adding a few extra minutes to the baking time.</p>

    <h3>What’s the best way to store leftover turnovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover turnovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate them for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months. Reheat in the oven to restore their crispness.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a store-bought gluten-free pastry dough?</h3>
    <p>Yes, if you’re short on time, you can use a store-bought gluten-free pastry dough. Just make sure to follow the package instructions for rolling and baking.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free apple turnovers are a delightful treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and a little patience, you can create pastries that are just as delicious and satisfying as traditional ones. Whether you’re new to gluten-free baking or a seasoned pro, these turnovers are sure to become a favorite in your recipe collection. So why not give them a try? Your taste buds will thank you!</p>
