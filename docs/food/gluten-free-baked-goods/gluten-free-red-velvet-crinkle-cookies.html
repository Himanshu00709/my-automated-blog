    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Red Velvet Crinkle Cookies</h2>
    <p>Now that we've covered the key ingredients, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delightful cookies:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter (or coconut oil) and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract and red food coloring until the mixture is evenly colored.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until a smooth dough forms.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Chill the Dough</h3>
    <p>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Chilling the dough helps it firm up, making it easier to handle and roll into balls.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Roll and Coat the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough is chilled, scoop out tablespoon-sized portions and roll them into balls. Roll each ball in powdered sugar until fully coated, then place them on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft. The cookies will continue to firm up as they cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Red Velvet Crinkle Cookies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. However, make sure it's a 1:1 substitute for all-purpose flour to ensure the right texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter.</p>

        <h3>How do I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the dough or baked cookies for longer storage.</p>

        <h3>Can I reduce the amount of sugar?</h3>
        <p>While you can reduce the sugar slightly, keep in mind that it plays a role in the texture and crinkle effect of the cookies. Experiment to find the right balance for your taste.</p>
