<p>As you can see, gluten-free bran flakes are a good source of dietary fiber, which is essential for maintaining a healthy digestive system. They also provide a decent amount of iron, which is crucial for preventing anemia and maintaining energy levels. Additionally, many brands fortify their gluten-free bran flakes with vitamins such as B12, D, and folic acid, making them a well-rounded breakfast option.</p>

<h2>How Do Gluten-Free Bran Flakes Compare to Traditional Bran Flakes?</h2>
