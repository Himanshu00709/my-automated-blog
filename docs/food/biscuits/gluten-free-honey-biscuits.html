<h1>Gluten-Free Honey Biscuits: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<p>Follow these simple steps to make your own gluten-free honey biscuits:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk the ingredients together until well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add Butter</h3>
<p>Add the cold, cubed butter to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, mix the honey, milk, and vanilla extract. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Shape the Biscuits</h3>
<p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a few times. Roll the dough out to about 1/2 inch thickness and use a biscuit cutter to cut out the biscuits. Place the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
<p>Bake the biscuits in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Honey Biscuits</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>

    <h3>2. Can I substitute the honey with another sweetener?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use other natural sweeteners like maple syrup or agave nectar. However, honey provides a unique flavor and moisture that other sweeteners may not replicate exactly.</p>

    <h3>3. How should I store gluten-free honey biscuits?</h3>
    <p>Store the biscuits in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the biscuits and reheat them in the oven when ready to serve.</p>

    <h3>4. Are gluten-free honey biscuits suitable for vegans?</h3>
