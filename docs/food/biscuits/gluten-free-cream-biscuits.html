    <h1>Gluten-Free Cream Biscuits: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of gluten intolerance and celiac disease. Among the many gluten-free options available, gluten-free cream biscuits have emerged as a popular choice for those seeking a delicious and healthy alternative to traditional biscuits. These biscuits are not only easy to make but also offer a delightful texture and flavor that can rival their gluten-containing counterparts. In this article, we will explore the world of gluten-free cream biscuits, their benefits, and how you can make them at home.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Cream Biscuits?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free cream biscuits are a type of biscuit made without any gluten-containing ingredients. Traditional biscuits are typically made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, gluten-free cream biscuits use alternative flours such as almond flour, rice flour, or a gluten-free flour blend. The "cream" in the name refers to the use of heavy cream or a dairy-free alternative as the primary liquid ingredient, which gives the biscuits a rich and tender texture.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Cream Biscuits</h2>

    <p>There are several benefits to choosing gluten-free cream biscuits over traditional ones:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Digestive Health:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems. Gluten-free cream biscuits provide a safe and delicious option that won't trigger these symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich:</strong> Many gluten-free flours, such as almond flour and coconut flour, are rich in nutrients like protein, fiber, and healthy fats. This makes gluten-free cream biscuits a more nutritious choice compared to traditional biscuits made with refined wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Gluten-free cream biscuits can be customized with various add-ins such as herbs, cheese, or even sweet ingredients like chocolate chips. This versatility makes them suitable for both savory and sweet applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Easy to Make:</strong> Unlike some gluten-free baked goods that require complex recipes and multiple ingredients, gluten-free cream biscuits are relatively simple to make. With just a few basic ingredients, you can whip up a batch in no time.</li>
    </ul>

    </table>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cut the cold butter into small pieces and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour in the heavy cream, stirring until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a few times to bring it together. Pat the dough into a 1-inch thick circle.</li>
        <li>Use a biscuit cutter or a glass to cut out biscuits from the dough. Place the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown on top.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>

        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer.
