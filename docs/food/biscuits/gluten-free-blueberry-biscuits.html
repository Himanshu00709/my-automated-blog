    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free blueberry biscuits is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a batch of delicious, fluffy biscuits:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 425°F (220°C). This ensures that your biscuits bake evenly and rise properly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Whisk them together to ensure even distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut in the butter:</strong> Add the cold, unsalted butter to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Add wet ingredients:</strong> Pour in the milk (or dairy-free alternative) and honey or maple syrup. Stir until the dough just comes together. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in blueberries:</strong> Gently fold the fresh blueberries into the dough. This step ensures that the blueberries are evenly distributed without being crushed.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the biscuits:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and gently pat it into a rectangle about 1 inch thick. Use a biscuit cutter to cut out rounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the biscuits on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the biscuits to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy them warm with a drizzle of honey or a dollop of jam.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Blueberry Biscuits</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free blueberry biscuits offer several health benefits, making them a great addition to your diet. Here are some of the key benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gluten-free:</strong> Ideal for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, these biscuits are made without wheat, barley, or rye.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich in antioxidants:</strong> Blueberries are a powerhouse of antioxidants, which help combat oxidative stress and inflammation in the body.</li>
        <li><strong>High in fiber:</strong> Gluten-free flours like almond or oat flour are often higher in fiber than traditional wheat flour, promoting digestive health.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower in refined sugars:</strong> Using natural sweeteners like honey or maple syrup reduces the amount of refined sugar in the recipe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Biscuits</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free biscuits can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use cold butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for creating flaky layers in your biscuits. Avoid using melted or softened butter.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough biscuits. Mix the dough just until it comes together.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose the right flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Add a touch of vinegar:</strong> A small amount of vinegar can help activate the baking powder, resulting in lighter, fluffier biscuits.</li>
    </ul>
