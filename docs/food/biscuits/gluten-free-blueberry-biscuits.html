    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your own gluten-free blueberry biscuits:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut in the Butter:</strong> Add the cold butter to the dry ingredients and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the milk, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract. Gradually add this mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Blueberries:</strong> Gently fold in the fresh blueberries, being careful not to overmix the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Biscuits:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a few times. Pat the dough into a 1-inch thick circle and cut out biscuits using a round cutter.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the biscuits to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy them warm with a drizzle of honey or a dollop of your favorite jam.</li>
    </ol>

The gluten-free flours used in these biscuits, such as almond or oat flour, are high in protein and fiber, making them more filling and nutritious than traditional wheat flour. Additionally, by using natural sweeteners like honey or maple syrup, you can avoid the refined sugars found in many store-bought biscuits, making these a healthier option overall.</p>
