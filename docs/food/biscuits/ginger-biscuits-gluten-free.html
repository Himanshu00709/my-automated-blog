    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, ground ginger, ground cinnamon, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a separate large bowl, cream together the butter (or coconut oil) and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the molasses, egg, and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
