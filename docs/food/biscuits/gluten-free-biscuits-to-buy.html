    <h2>What to Look for When Buying Gluten-Free Biscuits</h2>

    <p>When shopping for gluten-free biscuits, it’s important to consider more than just the absence of gluten. Here are some key factors to keep in mind:</p>

    <h3>1. Ingredient Quality</h3>
    <p>Look for biscuits made with whole, natural ingredients. Avoid products with artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives. Opt for those that use almond flour, coconut flour, or oat flour as the base, as these are generally healthier alternatives to refined flours.</p>

    <h3>2. Nutritional Content</h3>
    <p>Check the nutritional label for sugar, fat, and fiber content. Many gluten-free biscuits are lower in sugar and higher in fiber, making them a healthier choice. However, some brands may compensate for the lack of gluten by adding extra sugar or fat, so it’s important to read the labels carefully.</p>

    <h3>3. Taste and Texture</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free biscuits can vary widely in taste and texture. Some may be crumbly, while others are chewy or crispy. It’s a good idea to try a few different brands to find the one that best suits your palate.</p>

    <h3>4. Certifications</h3>
    <p>If you have celiac disease or a severe gluten intolerance, look for products that are certified gluten-free. This ensures that the product has been tested and meets strict gluten-free standards.</p>
