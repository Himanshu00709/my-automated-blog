<h1>Gluten-Free Florentine Biscuits: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>

<p>Florentine biscuits are a classic confectionery delight, known for their crisp texture, rich flavor, and beautiful appearance. Traditionally made with almonds, candied fruits, and a lacy caramel base, these biscuits are a favorite during the holiday season. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying these treats can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free Florentine biscuits—a delicious alternative that allows everyone to indulge in this timeless treat without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

<h2>What Are Florentine Biscuits?</h2>

<p>Florentine biscuits originate from Florence, Italy, and are characterized by their thin, crispy texture and nutty flavor. They are typically made with a combination of nuts (usually almonds), dried fruits, and a caramelized sugar base. The biscuits are often dipped in chocolate on one side, adding an extra layer of indulgence. While traditional Florentines contain gluten due to the use of flour, gluten-free versions substitute this ingredient with alternatives like almond flour or gluten-free oats, making them safe for those with gluten intolerance.</p>

<h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. As awareness of gluten-related disorders has grown, so has the demand for gluten-free alternatives to popular foods. Gluten-free Florentine biscuits are not only a safer option for those with gluten intolerance but also a delicious treat that everyone can enjoy.</p>

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Florentine Biscuits</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free Florentine biscuits is surprisingly simple. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating these delightful treats at home:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> Gather all your ingredients and preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine almond flour, gluten-free oats, and any additional nuts or dried fruits you’re using.</li>
    <li><strong>Create the Caramel Base:</strong> In a saucepan, melt butter or coconut oil with honey or maple syrup. Stir until the mixture is smooth and slightly thickened.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Pour the caramel mixture over the dry ingredients and mix until everything is well-coated.</li>
    <li><strong>Form the Biscuits:</strong> Drop spoonfuls of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them apart to allow for spreading.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Allow the biscuits to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack.</li>
    <li><strong>Dip in Chocolate:</strong> Once the biscuits are completely cool, melt dark chocolate and dip one side of each biscuit into the chocolate. Place them back on the parchment paper to set.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Florentines</h2>

<p>To ensure your gluten-free Florentine biscuits turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh nuts and dried fruits will yield the best flavor and texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Watch the Oven:</strong> Florentines can go from golden to burnt quickly, so keep a close eye on them during baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Allow to Cool Completely:</strong> The biscuits will continue to crisp up as they cool, so resist the urge to move them too soon.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to customize your Florentines with different nuts, fruits, or even a sprinkle of sea salt on the chocolate.</li>
</ul>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use other gluten-free flours instead of almond flour?</h3>
