    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Pasta Salad</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making a delicious gluten-free dairy-free pasta salad.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Gluten-Free Pasta</h3>
    <p>Start by boiling the gluten-free pasta according to the package instructions. Be sure not to overcook it, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy if cooked for too long. Once cooked, drain the pasta and rinse it under cold water to stop the cooking process. This will also help the pasta maintain its texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Vegetables and Protein</h3>
    <p>While the pasta is cooking, chop your vegetables and prepare your protein source. If you're using grilled chicken, make sure it's cooked and cooled before adding it to the salad. For tofu, you can either bake or pan-fry it until it's golden brown. Chickpeas can be used straight from the can, but you can also roast them for added crunch.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Dairy-Free Dressing</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, whisk together your chosen dairy-free dressing ingredients. A simple dressing can be made with olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. For a creamier option, you can use tahini or avocado as a base.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine All Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta, chopped vegetables, and protein. Pour the dressing over the top and toss everything together until well-coated. Add fresh herbs and spices to taste, and give the salad a final toss.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>For the best flavor, let the pasta salad chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld together. Serve cold as a main dish or side dish, and enjoy!</p>
