    <h2>How to Use Pillsbury Gluten-Free Pizza Dough</h2>

    <p>Using Pillsbury Gluten-Free Pizza Dough is straightforward, but there are a few tips and tricks to ensure your pizza turns out perfectly. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to the temperature specified on the dough packaging, usually around 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Your Surface:</strong> Lightly flour your work surface with gluten-free flour to prevent the dough from sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Gently roll out the dough to your desired thickness. For a crispier crust, roll it thinner; for a thicker, chewier crust, leave it a bit thicker.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Spread your favorite pizza sauce over the dough, then add your choice of toppings. Be creative, but don’t overload the pizza, as this can make it soggy.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Transfer the pizza to a preheated oven and bake for the recommended time, usually around 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>

    <p>Making a great gluten-free pizza requires a bit of finesse. Here are some expert tips to help you achieve the best results:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Pizza Stone:</strong> A pizza stone can help distribute heat evenly and create a crispier crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overload with Toppings:</strong> Gluten-free dough can be more delicate than traditional dough, so it’s best to keep toppings light and evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Bake the Crust:</strong> For an extra crispy crust, consider pre-baking the dough for a few minutes before adding toppings.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free dough pairs well with a variety of flavors, so don’t be afraid to experiment with different sauces, cheeses, and toppings.</li>
    </ul>
