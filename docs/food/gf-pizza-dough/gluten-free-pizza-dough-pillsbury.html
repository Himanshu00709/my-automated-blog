    <h2>How to Use Pillsbury's Gluten-Free Pizza Dough</h2>

    <p>Using Pillsbury's Gluten-Free Pizza Dough is straightforward, but there are a few tips and tricks to ensure that your pizza turns out perfectly:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the packaging, usually around 425°F (220°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Your Surface:</strong> Lightly dust your work surface with gluten-free flour to prevent the dough from sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Roll out the dough to your desired thickness. Keep in mind that gluten-free dough may not stretch as easily as traditional dough, so be patient.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Your Toppings:</strong> Spread your favorite sauce, cheese, and toppings over the dough. Be mindful not to overload the pizza, as this can make it difficult to cook evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for the recommended time, usually around 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Let It Cool:</strong> Allow the pizza to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>

    <p>Making a great gluten-free pizza requires a bit of finesse. Here are some additional tips to help you achieve the best results:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Pizza Stone:</strong> A pizza stone can help to evenly distribute heat and create a crispier crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overload with Toppings:</strong> Gluten-free dough can be more delicate than traditional dough, so it's best to keep your toppings light and evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free pizza dough can be a blank canvas for a variety of flavors. Consider adding herbs or spices to the dough for an extra kick.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Dough Rest:</strong> Allowing the dough to rest for a few minutes after rolling it out can help it to relax and prevent it from shrinking during baking.</li>
    </ul>
