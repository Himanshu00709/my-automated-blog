    <h2>How to Use Pillsbury Gluten-Free Pizza Dough</h2>

    <p>Using Pillsbury’s gluten-free pizza dough is straightforward, but there are a few tips and tricks to ensure you get the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature:</strong> Before you start working with the dough, let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. This will make it easier to roll out and shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Parchment Paper:</strong> Gluten-free dough can be a bit sticky, so it’s a good idea to roll it out on parchment paper. This will also make it easier to transfer to your baking sheet or pizza stone.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Bake the Crust:</strong> To avoid a soggy crust, pre-bake the dough for about 5-7 minutes before adding your toppings. This will help the crust hold up better once the toppings are added.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overload with Toppings:</strong> Gluten-free dough can be more delicate than traditional dough, so it’s best to go easy on the toppings. A lighter load will help the crust cook evenly and prevent it from becoming too heavy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs About Pillsbury Gluten-Free Pizza Dough</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Is Pillsbury Gluten-Free Pizza Dough Safe for Celiac Disease?</h3>
        <p>Yes, Pillsbury’s gluten-free pizza dough is certified gluten-free and is safe for individuals with celiac disease. However, always check the packaging for any potential cross-contamination warnings if you have severe gluten sensitivity.</p>

        <h3>Can I Freeze Pillsbury Gluten-Free Pizza Dough?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the dough if you don’t plan to use it right away. Just make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer-safe bag. When you’re ready to use it, let it thaw in the refrigerator overnight before bringing it to room temperature.</p>

        <h3>What Toppings Work Best with Gluten-Free Pizza Dough?</h3>
        <p>You can use any toppings you like, but lighter options such as fresh vegetables, lean meats, and a moderate amount of cheese tend to work best. Avoid overly heavy or wet toppings, as they can make the crust soggy.</p>

        <h3>How Does Gluten-Free Pizza Dough Taste Compared to Regular Dough?</h3>
        <p>Pillsbury’s gluten-free pizza dough has a slightly different texture and flavor compared to traditional dough, but many people find it to be a satisfying alternative. The crust is typically a bit crispier and has a mild, slightly nutty flavor due to the rice flour.</p>
