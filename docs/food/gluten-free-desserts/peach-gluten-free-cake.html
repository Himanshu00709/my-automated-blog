    <h1>Peach Gluten-Free Cake: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>When it comes to desserts, few things are as satisfying as a moist, flavorful cake. But for those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding the perfect cake can be a challenge.

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free cakes often use alternative flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or rice flour, which can add unique flavors and textures to your baked goods. These flours are also rich in nutrients, making your cake not only tasty but also nutritious.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create a perfect peach gluten-free cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Peaches:</strong> Peel and slice the peaches into thin wedges. Set aside a few slices for the top of the cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined; do not overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Peaches:</strong> Gently fold in the sliced peaches, reserving a few slices for the top.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and arrange the reserved peach slices on top. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
