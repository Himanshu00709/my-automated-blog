    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free dirt dessert is simple and requires no baking. Follow these steps to create your own:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Pudding:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the instant chocolate pudding mix and milk until smooth. Allow it to set in the refrigerator for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Whipped Topping:</strong> Once the pudding has set, gently fold in the whipped topping until fully combined. This will give the pudding a light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Crush the Cookies:</strong> Place the gluten-free chocolate cookies in a zip-top bag and crush them using a rolling pin or your hands. You want the cookies to resemble dirt, so don’t crush them too finely.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer the Dessert:</strong> In a serving dish or individual cups, start by adding a layer of the crushed cookies. Follow with a layer of the pudding mixture, then repeat the layers until you reach the top of the dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Gummy Worms:</strong> Finish by placing gummy worms on top of the dessert, partially burying them in the “dirt” for a fun, garden-like effect.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill and Serve:</strong> Refrigerate the dessert for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
    </ol>
