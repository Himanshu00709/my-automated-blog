    <p>Making a gluten-free plum crisp is easier than you might think. With a few simple ingredients and some basic kitchen tools, you can create a dessert that’s both healthy and satisfying. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6-8 ripe plums, pitted and sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup gluten-free oats</li>
        <li>1/2 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup coconut sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup melted coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the sliced plums with 1-2 tablespoons of coconut sugar and a pinch of cinnamon. Toss to coat evenly, then spread the plums in a baking dish.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix the gluten-free oats, almond flour, remaining coconut sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Add the melted coconut oil and stir until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the oat mixture evenly over the plums in the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the plums are bubbling.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Plum Crisp</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use other fruits instead of plums?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While plums are the star of this recipe, you can easily substitute them with other fruits like apples, peaches, or berries. Just adjust the sugar and spices accordingly to complement the fruit you choose.</p>

        <h3>2. Is almond flour necessary, or can I use another gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour adds a nice texture and flavor to the crisp, but you can use other gluten-free flours like oat flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this recipe is already vegan-friendly as long as you use coconut oil and ensure that your oats and other ingredients are certified vegan. If you’re serving it with ice cream or whipped cream, opt for vegan alternatives.</p>

        <h3>4. How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover plum crisp in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat it in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
