<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making a Gluten-Free Peach Tart</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>

<p>Start by making the crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, and a pinch of salt. Cut in cold butter or coconut oil until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add an egg and mix until the dough comes together. Press the dough into a tart pan, making sure to evenly distribute it along the bottom and sides. Chill the crust in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to firm it up.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>

<p>While the crust is chilling, prepare the peach filling. Slice fresh peaches into thin wedges and toss them with honey or maple syrup, a splash of vanilla extract, and a pinch of cinnamon. This will enhance the natural sweetness of the peaches and add a warm, aromatic flavor to the tart.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble the Tart</h3>

<p>Once the crust has chilled, arrange the peach slices in a circular pattern over the crust. You can get creative with the design, but a simple spiral pattern works beautifully. Pour any remaining syrup from the peaches over the top to ensure the tart is moist and flavorful.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Bake the Tart</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the tart for 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the peaches are tender. Keep an eye on the tart during the last few minutes of baking to prevent the crust from over-browning.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Allow the tart to cool slightly before serving. It can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature, and pairs wonderfully with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The combination of the buttery crust and the sweet, juicy peaches is sure to delight your taste buds.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Peach Tart</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen peaches instead of fresh ones?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen peaches if fresh ones are not available. However, make sure to thaw and drain them thoroughly before using to avoid excess moisture in the tart.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of almond flour?</h3>
    <p>If you have a nut allergy, you can substitute almond flour with oat flour or another gluten-free flour of your choice. Keep in mind that this may slightly alter the texture and flavor of the crust.</p>

    <h3>How do I store a gluten-free peach tart?</h3>
    <p>Store the tart in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze the tart for up to a month. To reheat, simply place it in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 10-15 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this tart vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make this tart vegan by substituting the butter with coconut oil and using a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of a regular egg.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>A gluten-free peach tart is a wonderful dessert that combines the natural sweetness of peaches with a tender, buttery crust.

With the right ingredients and a little bit of patience, you can create a dessert that is both delicious and accommodating to dietary needs. So why not give it a try?
