    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Hello Dolly Bars</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free Hello Dolly Bars is just as easy as making the traditional version. Follow these simple steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven</strong> to 350°F (175°C) and line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the crust</strong> by mixing the crushed gluten-free graham crackers with melted butter. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of the prepared pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer the ingredients</strong> by evenly sprinkling the chocolate chips, shredded coconut, and chopped nuts over the crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour the sweetened condensed milk</strong> evenly over the top, ensuring that all the layers are covered.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong> for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the edges are bubbling.</li>
