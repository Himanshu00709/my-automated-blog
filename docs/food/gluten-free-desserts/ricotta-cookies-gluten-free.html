    <h1>Gluten-Free Ricotta Cookies: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Ricotta cookies are a classic Italian dessert known for their soft, cake-like texture and delicate flavor. Traditionally made with wheat flour, these cookies can be easily adapted to a gluten-free diet without sacrificing taste or texture. Whether you're gluten-intolerant, celiac, or simply looking for a healthier alternative, gluten-free ricotta cookies are a delightful treat that everyone can enjoy. In this blog post, we'll explore the history of ricotta cookies, the benefits of going gluten-free, and provide a step-by-step recipe to make your own gluten-free ricotta cookies at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Ricotta Cookies</h2>

    <p>Ricotta cookies have their roots in Italian cuisine, where ricotta cheese is a staple ingredient in both savory and sweet dishes. The use of ricotta in baking dates back centuries, with the cheese adding moisture and richness to baked goods. Ricotta cookies, in particular, became popular in Italian-American households, often served during holidays and special occasions. The cookies are typically soft, slightly sweet, and often topped with a simple glaze or sprinkles. Over time, the recipe has evolved, and today, gluten-free versions are becoming increasingly popular as more people adopt gluten-free diets.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of health issues, including digestive problems, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. However, even for those without gluten-related health concerns, a gluten-free diet can offer benefits such as improved digestion, increased energy levels, and better overall health. Gluten-free baking has come a long way in recent years, with a wide variety of alternative flours and ingredients available that make it easy to create delicious, gluten-free versions of your favorite treats.</p>

    <p>Making gluten-free ricotta cookies is easier than you might think. The key is to use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend that mimics the texture of traditional wheat flour. Below is a detailed recipe for gluten-free ricotta cookies that are soft, moist, and absolutely delicious.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
