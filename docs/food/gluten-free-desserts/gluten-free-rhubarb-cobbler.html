    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Rhubarb Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large bowl, combine the chopped rhubarb and ½ cup of granulated sugar. Mix well and set aside to allow the rhubarb to release its juices.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, remaining ½ cup of sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract until just combined.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Transfer the rhubarb mixture to a greased baking dish. Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler topping over the rhubarb, spreading it out slightly. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the rhubarb is bubbling. Allow the cobbler to cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Rhubarb Cobbler</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will provide the best texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> When making the cobbler topping, be careful not to overmix the dough. Overmixing can lead to a tough topping.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> Rhubarb is naturally tart, so feel free to adjust the amount of sugar to suit your taste. You can also add a touch of cinnamon or nutmeg for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen rhubarb?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen rhubarb in this recipe. Just make sure to thaw and drain it well before using to avoid excess moisture in the cobbler.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative and use a non-dairy milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
