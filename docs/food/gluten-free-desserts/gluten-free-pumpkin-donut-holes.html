    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free pumpkin donut holes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and greasing a mini muffin tin or donut hole pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the pumpkin puree, eggs, coconut sugar, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the pan:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared pan, filling each cavity about three-quarters full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the donut holes to cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pumpkin Donut Holes</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free pumpkin donut holes turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use fresh ingredients:</strong> Fresh pumpkin puree and spices will give your donut holes the best flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to dense donut holes. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking your donut holes at the 12-minute mark to avoid overbaking.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with toppings:</strong> While these donut holes are delicious on their own, you can also roll them in cinnamon sugar or drizzle them with a simple glaze for extra sweetness.</li>
