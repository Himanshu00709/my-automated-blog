<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Cranberry Bliss Bars</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free cranberry bliss bars is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a batch of these delightful holiday treats:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Blondie Base</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line an 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in the dried cranberries and white chocolate chips. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the blondie base to cool completely before adding the frosting.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Make the Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>

<p>In a medium bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar, beating until well combined. Stir in the orange zest. Spread the frosting evenly over the cooled blondie base.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add the Toppings</h3>

<p>Sprinkle additional dried cranberries over the frosting. Melt the remaining white chocolate chips and drizzle the melted chocolate over the top of the bars. Allow the chocolate to set before cutting the bars into squares.</p>
