<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started on making your gluten-free blackberry cobbler. Follow these steps for a delicious dessert that’s sure to impress:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure that your cobbler bakes evenly and achieves a golden-brown crust.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Blackberries</h3>
<p>In a large bowl, combine the fresh blackberries with 1/2 cup of granulated sugar. Gently toss the blackberries to coat them evenly with the sugar. Set aside while you prepare the crust.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond flour, tapioca starch, baking powder, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, vanilla extract, and milk. Pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. The dough should be slightly sticky but manageable.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Assemble the Cobbler</h3>
<p>Transfer the sugared blackberries to a greased 9x9 inch baking dish. Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler topping over the blackberries, spreading it out slightly to cover most of the fruit. Don’t worry if some blackberries are still visible—this will give your cobbler a rustic look.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake and Serve</h3>
<p>Bake the cobbler in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the blackberries are bubbling. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra treat.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Blackberry Cobbler</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use frozen blackberries instead of fresh?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen blackberries if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in the cobbler.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I substitute the almond flour with another gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>Almond flour provides a rich, nutty flavor and a tender texture, but you can substitute it with other gluten-free flours like oat flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>3. How do I store leftover cobbler?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat it in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

    <h3>4. Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>This recipe can be made vegan by using a dairy-free butter substitute and a plant-based milk. You can also replace the egg with a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water).</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free blackberry cobbler is a delightful dessert that proves you don’t have to sacrifice flavor or texture when baking without gluten. With the right ingredients and a little bit of effort, you can create a dessert that is both healthy and indulgent. Whether you’re serving it at a family gathering or enjoying it as a special treat, this cobbler is sure to be a hit. So why not give it a try? Your taste buds—and your body—will thank you!</p>
