    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, softened butter, sugar, and salt. Mix until the ingredients form a crumbly dough. Press the dough evenly into the bottom of a greased 9x9 inch baking pan. Bake the crust for about 15 minutes, or until it turns golden brown. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Raspberry Filling</h3>

    <p>While the crust is cooling, prepare the raspberry filling. In a saucepan, combine the fresh raspberries, sugar, lemon juice, and cornstarch. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens and the raspberries break down. This should take about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>

    <p>Pour the raspberry filling over the baked crust, spreading it evenly. Return the pan to the oven and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is set. Allow the squares to cool completely before cutting them into individual servings.</p>
