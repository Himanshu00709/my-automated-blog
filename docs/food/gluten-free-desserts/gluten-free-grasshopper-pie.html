    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Grasshopper Pie</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free Grasshopper Pie is surprisingly simple. Follow these steps to create a dessert that’s sure to impress:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by crushing gluten-free chocolate cookies or graham crackers into fine crumbs. Mix the crumbs with melted butter and press the mixture into a pie dish. Bake the crust for about 10 minutes at 350°F (175°C) to set it, then let it cool completely.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine unflavored gelatin with cold water and let it bloom. Heat milk in a saucepan until warm, then dissolve the gelatin mixture into it. Add sugar, mint extract, and a few drops of green food coloring (optional) for that classic grasshopper look. Let the mixture cool slightly before folding in whipped cream or a dairy-free alternative.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Pour the mint filling into the cooled crust and smooth the top with a spatula. Refrigerate the pie for at least 4 hours, or until the filling is fully set. Before serving, garnish with additional whipped cream and gluten-free chocolate shavings for an extra touch of elegance.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Grasshopper Pie</h2>

    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh mint instead of mint extract?</h3>
        <p>While fresh mint can be used, it may not provide the same intense flavor as mint extract. If using fresh mint, steep it in the warm milk before adding the gelatin.</p>
    </div>
