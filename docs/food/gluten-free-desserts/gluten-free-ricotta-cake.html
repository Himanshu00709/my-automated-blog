    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Ricotta Cake</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free ricotta cake is straightforward, and the result is a deliciously moist and tender cake that everyone will love. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the ricotta cheese, melted butter, vanilla extract, and lemon zest (if using). Mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve plain or with your favorite toppings, such as fresh berries, whipped cream, or a dusting of powdered sugar.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Ricotta Cake</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free ricotta cake turns out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Cake Cool Completely:</strong> Allowing the cake to cool completely before serving ensures that it sets properly and is easier to slice.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add different flavors to your cake, such as orange zest, almond extract, or even chocolate chips.</li>
    </ul>
