    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free plum cobbler is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a dessert that’s sure to impress:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Plums</h3>
    <p>Start by washing and slicing the plums. Remove the pits and cut the plums into thin slices. Arrange the slices in a baking dish, spreading them out evenly. You can sprinkle a little sugar over the plums to enhance their natural sweetness.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small pieces and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to mix the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the milk and vanilla extract, stirring until the dough comes together.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler topping over the plums, spreading it out as evenly as possible. Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the plums are bubbling. Allow the cobbler to cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Plum Cobbler</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free plum cobbler turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Plums:</strong> Opt for plums that are ripe but still firm. Overripe plums can become too mushy when baked.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for creating a flaky cobbler topping. If the butter is too soft, the topping may become dense.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a tough topping. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let It Rest:</strong> Allow the cobbler to cool for at least 10 minutes before serving. This will help the flavors meld together and make it easier to serve.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Plum Cobbler</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen plums?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen plums if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in the cobbler.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cobbler vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the butter with a vegan alternative and use a non-dairy milk like almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use other fruits?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this recipe works well with other fruits like peaches, apples, or berries. Adjust the sugar accordingly based on the sweetness of the fruit.</p>
