    <h1>Gluten-Free Alfajores: A Delicious Twist on a Classic Treat</h1>

    <p>Alfajores are a beloved dessert originating from South America, particularly popular in Argentina, Peru, and Chile. These delightful sandwich cookies consist of two tender, crumbly cookies filled with a luscious layer of dulce de leche. Traditionally, alfajores are made with wheat flour, but with the rise of gluten-free diets, many bakers have adapted the recipe to cater to those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free alfajores, from their history to how you can make them at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Alfajores</h2>

    <p>Alfajores have a rich history that dates back to the Moorish influence in Spain. The name "alfajor" is derived from the Arabic word "al-hasu," which means "filled." When the Spanish colonized South America, they brought this sweet treat with them, and it quickly became a staple in the region. Over time, the recipe evolved, and today, alfajores are a symbol of South American culinary heritage.</p>

    <p>Traditional alfajores are made with wheat flour, but as gluten-free diets have gained popularity, bakers have experimented with alternative flours to create a version that everyone can enjoy. Gluten-free alfajores are just as delicious as their traditional counterparts, with a delicate texture and a rich, caramel-like filling.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease, a condition where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. However, many people without celiac disease also choose to avoid gluten due to gluten sensitivity or as part of a healthier lifestyle. Gluten-free baking can be challenging, but with the right ingredients and techniques, you can create baked goods that are just as satisfying as those made with traditional flour.</p>

    <p>When it comes to alfajores, going gluten-free doesn’t mean sacrificing flavor or texture. In fact, gluten-free flours like almond flour, rice flour, and tapioca flour can add a unique depth of flavor and a tender crumb that complements the dulce de leche filling perfectly.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Alfajores</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free alfajores is a straightforward process, but it requires attention to detail to ensure the cookies turn out perfectly. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks one at a time, mixing well after each addition. In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond flour, rice flour, and tapioca flour. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This will make the dough easier to handle and prevent it from spreading too much during baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll and Cut:</strong> On a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour), roll out the dough to about 1/4 inch thickness. Use a round cookie cutter to cut out the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Place the cookies on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool completely before filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the Cookies:</strong> Spread a generous amount of dulce de leche on the flat side of one cookie and sandwich it with another. Repeat with the remaining cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Coating:</strong> For an extra touch, you can roll the edges of the alfajores in shredded coconut or dust them with powdered sugar.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Alfajores</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use store-bought dulce de leche?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use store-bought dulce de leche for convenience. However, if you have the time, making your own dulce de leche from scratch can add an extra layer of flavor to your alfajores.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free alfajores?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free alfajores freeze well. Place them in an airtight container with parchment paper between layers to prevent sticking. They can be frozen for up to 2 months. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of almond flour?</h3>
        <p>If you have a nut allergy, you can substitute almond flour with oat flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Are gluten-free alfajores healthier?</h3>
        <p>While gluten-free alfajores are a great option for those with gluten sensitivities, they are still a treat and should be enjoyed in moderation. The nutritional content will depend on the ingredients used, such as the type of flour and the amount of sugar.</p>
