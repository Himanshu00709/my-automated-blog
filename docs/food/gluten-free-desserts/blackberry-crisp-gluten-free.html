    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Blackberry Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the fresh blackberries, granulated sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice. Gently toss the ingredients until the blackberries are evenly coated. Transfer the mixture to a greased 9x9 inch baking dish, spreading it out evenly.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Crisp Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free oats, almond flour, brown sugar, ground cinnamon, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small pieces and add it to the dry ingredients. Use your fingers or a pastry cutter to blend the butter into the mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. This will create the perfect texture for your crisp topping.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Sprinkle the crisp topping evenly over the blackberry filling. Make sure to cover the entire surface for a consistent crunch. Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the blackberry filling is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free blackberry crisp is best served warm, either on its own or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. The contrast between the warm, tart blackberries and the cold, creamy topping is simply irresistible. This dessert is perfect for summer gatherings, holiday dinners, or even as a sweet treat after a weeknight meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen blackberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blackberries if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in the filling.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of almond flour?</h3>
        <p>If you have a nut allergy, you can substitute almond flour with gluten-free oat flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover blackberry crisp in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter to make this recipe vegan-friendly.</p>
