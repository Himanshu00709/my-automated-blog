    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch square baking pan.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined. Gently fold in the blueberries.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly.</li>
        <li>To make the topping, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Cut in the cold butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the batter.</li>
        <li>Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the buckle to cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
