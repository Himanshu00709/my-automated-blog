    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free blackberry cobbler is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a dessert that’s sure to impress:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your cobbler bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Blackberries</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, toss the blackberries with ½ cup of sugar. This helps to draw out the natural juices of the berries, creating a deliciously sweet and tangy filling.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, remaining sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the cold butter pieces and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the milk and vanilla extract, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the topping dense.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Cobbler</h3>
    <p>Pour the sugared blackberries into a greased baking dish. Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler topping over the berries, spreading it out slightly but leaving some gaps for the fruit to peek through.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the blackberry filling is bubbling. Let the cobbler cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Blackberry Cobbler</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen blackberries instead of fresh ones?</h3>
        <p>Yes, frozen blackberries work just as well as fresh ones. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in your cobbler.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour to use?</h3>
        <p>A gluten-free flour blend that includes xanthan gum is ideal, as it helps to mimic the texture of traditional flour. Popular brands include Bob’s Red Mill and King Arthur Flour.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cobbler dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil, and use a non-dairy milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat it in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
