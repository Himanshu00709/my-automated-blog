    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Dirt Cake</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free dirt cake is a straightforward process that requires no baking. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating this delightful dessert:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cookie Crumbs</h3>

    <p>Start by crushing the gluten-free chocolate cookies into fine crumbs. You can do this by placing the cookies in a zip-top bag and using a rolling pin to crush them, or by pulsing them in a food processor. Set the crumbs aside for later use.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Pudding</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the instant chocolate pudding mix and milk until the mixture thickens. This usually takes about 2 minutes. Set the pudding aside to set further while you prepare the next layer.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Cream Cheese Mixture</h3>

    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and butter together until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar, continuing to beat until the mixture is light and fluffy. Fold in the whipped topping until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Layer the Dessert</h3>

    <p>In a large serving dish or individual cups, start by layering the cookie crumbs at the bottom. Next, add a layer of the chocolate pudding, followed by a layer of the cream cheese mixture. Repeat the layers until you’ve used up all the ingredients, finishing with a layer of cookie crumbs on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Gummy Worms</h3>

    <p>For the final touch, place gummy worms on top of the cake, partially burying them in the cookie crumbs to create the illusion of worms in dirt. Refrigerate the cake for at least 2 hours before serving to allow the flavors to meld together.</p>
