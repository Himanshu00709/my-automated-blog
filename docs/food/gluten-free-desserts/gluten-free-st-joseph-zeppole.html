    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Zeppole</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free zeppole can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor the oil temperature:</strong> Maintaining the correct oil temperature is crucial for achieving a light and airy texture. Use a kitchen thermometer to ensure the oil stays at 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense zeppole. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with fillings:</strong> While traditional zeppole are filled with custard or ricotta, feel free to get creative with other fillings like chocolate ganache or fruit preserves.</li>
