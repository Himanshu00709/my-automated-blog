    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Pears</h3>
    <p>Start by peeling and coring the pears. Slice them into thin wedges and place them in a mixing bowl. Add the lemon juice, vanilla extract, and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Toss the pears gently to ensure they are evenly coated. This step not only enhances the flavor but also prevents the pears from browning.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Crumble Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, rolled oats, brown sugar, and a pinch of salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the mixture. Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, work the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. This crumbly texture is what gives the dessert its signature topping.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer the prepared pears into a baking dish, spreading them out evenly. Sprinkle the crumble topping over the pears, ensuring an even layer. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the pears are tender. The aroma of cinnamon and baked pears will fill your kitchen, signaling that your dessert is ready.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free pear crumble is best served warm, straight from the oven. For an extra touch of indulgence, consider serving it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. The contrast between the warm crumble and the cold ice cream creates a delightful sensory experience. Alternatively, you can enjoy it with a drizzle of honey or a sprinkle of chopped nuts for added texture.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free pear crumble is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Pears are rich in dietary fiber, which aids in digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut. They are also a good source of vitamin C and antioxidants, which support the immune system. The gluten-free flour and oats provide a good source of complex carbohydrates, making this dessert a satisfying and energy-boosting treat.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use other fruits instead of pears?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While pears are the star of this recipe, you can easily substitute them with other fruits like apples, peaches, or berries. Just adjust the baking time accordingly, as different fruits may have varying levels of moisture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this recipe vegan by using a dairy-free butter alternative and ensuring that your oats and flour are certified gluten-free and vegan. The result will be just as delicious and satisfying.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftover gluten-free pear crumble can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply place it in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes, or until warmed through.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this dessert?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked crumble for up to 2 months. Make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. To reheat, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and then warm it in the oven.</p>
