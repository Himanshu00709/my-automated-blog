By opting for gluten-free desserts like fruit tarts, you can enjoy a sweet treat without compromising your health. Additionally, gluten-free baking often incorporates nutrient-rich ingredients like almond flour, coconut flour, and oats, which can add extra fiber and protein to your diet.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making a Gluten-Free Fruit Tart</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, combine 1 ½ cups of almond flour, ½ cup of coconut flour, and ¼ cup of tapioca starch. Add ½ cup of softened butter or coconut oil and mix until the dough comes together. Press the dough into a tart pan, making sure to evenly distribute it across the bottom and sides. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Allow it to cool completely before adding the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Gluten-Free Pastry Cream</h3>
    <p>In a saucepan, whisk together 2 cups of milk (or a dairy-free alternative), ½ cup of sugar, and 3 tablespoons of cornstarch. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly until it thickens. In a separate bowl, beat 2 egg yolks and gradually add them to the saucepan, continuing to stir. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the cream is thick and smooth. Remove from heat and stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Let the pastry cream cool before spreading it over the crust.</p>

    <h3>3. Arrange the Fresh Fruits</h3>
    <p>Once the pastry cream has set, it’s time to add the fresh fruits. Slice a variety of fruits such as strawberries, kiwi, blueberries, and mango into thin pieces. Arrange them in a decorative pattern on top of the pastry cream. You can also brush the fruits with a light glaze made from apricot jam and water to give them a shiny finish.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fruit Tarts</h2>

        <h3>Can I use other gluten-free flours?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like rice flour, oat flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. However, keep in mind that different flours have varying textures and absorption rates, so you may need to adjust the recipe accordingly.</p>
