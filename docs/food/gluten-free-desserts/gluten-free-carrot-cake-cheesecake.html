    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step instructions for making this gluten-free carrot cake cheesecake.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Carrot Cake Layer</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. In a separate bowl, combine the grated carrots, granulated sugar, brown sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Pour the batter into a greased 9-inch springform pan and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Cheesecake Layer</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth. Add the granulated sugar and continue to beat until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract and sour cream until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Pour the cheesecake batter over the carrot cake layer in the springform pan.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Place the springform pan in the preheated oven and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the cheesecake is set and the edges are lightly golden. The center should still have a slight jiggle when you gently shake the pan. Turn off the oven and let the cake cool in the oven with the door slightly ajar for about an hour. This helps prevent cracking. Once cooled, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature before refrigerating for at least 4 hours, or overnight.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfecting Your Gluten-Free Carrot Cake Cheesecake</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free carrot cake cheesecake turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use room temperature ingredients:</strong> This ensures that the batter mixes evenly and results in a smoother texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool gradually:</strong> Allowing the cake to cool slowly in the oven helps prevent cracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill thoroughly:</strong> Refrigerating the cake for several hours or overnight allows the flavors to meld and the cheesecake to set properly.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
