    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get baking! Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free peppermint brownies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking pan and line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend and cocoa powder. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, mix the melted butter (or coconut oil) and sugar until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the peppermint extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in the dark chocolate chips if using.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Sprinkle the crushed peppermint candies on top. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan before cutting them into squares. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
