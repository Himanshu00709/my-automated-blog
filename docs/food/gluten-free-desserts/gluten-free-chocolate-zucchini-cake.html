<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Follow these simple steps to bake your gluten-free chocolate zucchini cake:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the vegetable oil and vanilla extract, and mix until smooth.</li>
    <li><strong>Incorporate Zucchini:</strong> Fold the grated zucchini into the wet ingredients. The zucchini will add moisture to the cake, ensuring it stays soft and tender.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Chocolate Chips:</strong> If desired, fold in the dark chocolate chips for an extra layer of richness.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve as is or with a dusting of powdered sugar.</li>
</ol>
