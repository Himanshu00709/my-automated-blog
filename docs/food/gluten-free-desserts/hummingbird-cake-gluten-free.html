    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free Hummingbird Cake is similar to making the traditional version, with a few adjustments to ensure the cake stays moist and flavorful. Follow these steps to create your own gluten-free masterpiece:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, mix the mashed bananas, crushed pineapple, eggs, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and sugar until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Fold in the chopped pecans.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li><strong>Frost:</strong> Once the cakes are completely cool, frost them with your favorite cream cheese frosting and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfecting Your Gluten-Free Hummingbird Cake</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free Hummingbird Cake turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will give you the best texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix the ingredients until just combined to keep the cake light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Xanthan Gum:</strong> If your gluten-free flour blend doesn’t already contain xanthan gum, consider adding ½ teaspoon to help bind the ingredients together.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Cake Cool Completely:</strong> Make sure the cake is completely cool before frosting it. This will prevent the frosting from melting and sliding off the cake.</li>
    </ul>
