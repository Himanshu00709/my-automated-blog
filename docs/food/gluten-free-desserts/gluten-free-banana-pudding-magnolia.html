    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Pudding</h3>

    <p>In a medium saucepan, whisk together the milk, granulated sugar, and cornstarch. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it begins to thicken. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks. Gradually add a small amount of the hot milk mixture to the egg yolks, whisking constantly to temper the eggs. Then, pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the pudding thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and stir in the butter and vanilla extract. Let the pudding cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>2. Layer the Ingredients</h3>

    <p>In a large serving dish or individual dessert cups, layer the gluten-free vanilla wafers, sliced bananas, and pudding. Start with a layer of wafers, followed by a layer of banana slices, and then a layer of pudding. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, ending with a layer of pudding on top.</p>

    <h3>3. Make the Whipped Cream Topping</h3>

    <p>In a large bowl, whip the heavy cream and powdered sugar together until stiff peaks form. Spread the whipped cream over the top layer of pudding. For an extra touch, you can garnish with additional banana slices or crumbled gluten-free vanilla wafers.</p>

    <h3>4. Chill and Serve</h3>

    <p>Cover the pudding and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until well-chilled. This allows the flavors to meld and the wafers to soften slightly. Serve cold and enjoy!</p>
