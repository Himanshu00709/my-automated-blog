    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a food processor, pulse the pecans until they are finely ground. Mix the ground pecans with melted butter and press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake for 10 minutes, then set aside to cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Filling:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the sugar, sour cream, and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Cheesecake:</strong> Pour the filling over the cooled crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until the center is set but still slightly jiggly. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door slightly open for 1 hour.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill and Serve:</strong> Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight, before serving.</li>
    </ol>
