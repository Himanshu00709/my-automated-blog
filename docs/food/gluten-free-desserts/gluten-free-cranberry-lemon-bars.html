    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all the ingredients ready, let's walk through the steps to create these mouthwatering gluten-free cranberry lemon bars:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, cold unsalted butter, and granulated sugar. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to blend the ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press this mixture evenly into the bottom of a greased 8x8-inch baking pan. Bake the crust for about 15 minutes, or until it's lightly golden.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the crust is baking, prepare the filling. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, granulated sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice until well combined. Gently fold in the fresh cranberries. Once the crust is ready, pour the filling over the baked crust, spreading it evenly.</p>

    <h3>3. Bake the Bars</h3>
    <p>Return the pan to the oven and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is set and the edges are lightly browned. Remove the pan from the oven and let it cool completely before cutting into bars.</p>

    <h3>4. Dust with Powdered Sugar</h3>
    <p>Once the bars have cooled, dust the top with powdered sugar for a finishing touch. This not only adds a touch of sweetness but also enhances the visual appeal of the bars.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Cranberry Lemon Bars</h2>
