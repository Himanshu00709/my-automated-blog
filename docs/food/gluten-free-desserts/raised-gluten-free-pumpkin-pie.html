<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>

<p>Start by combining the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, xanthan gum, and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>2. Roll Out the Dough</h3>

<p>Once the dough has chilled, roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pie dish, pressing it gently into the edges. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges for a decorative finish. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</p>

<h3>3. Prepare the Filling</h3>

<p>In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs, heavy cream, sugar, and spices until smooth and well combined. Pour the filling into the prepared crust, spreading it evenly.</p>

<h3>4. Bake the Pie</h3>

<p>Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the filling is set and a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the pie to cool completely before serving.</p>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a store-bought gluten-free pie crust?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use a store-bought gluten-free pie crust if you’re short on time. However, making your own crust allows you to control the ingredients and achieve a fresher, more flavorful result.</p>

    <h3>2. How do I store leftover pumpkin pie?</h3>
    <p>Store leftover pumpkin pie in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, for up to 4 days. You can also freeze the pie for up to 2 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator before serving.</p>
