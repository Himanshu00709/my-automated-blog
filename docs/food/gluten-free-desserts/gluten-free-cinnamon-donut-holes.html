    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free cinnamon donut holes:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, salt, and ground cinnamon. In a separate bowl, combine the granulated sugar, egg, milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a smooth dough forms.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Shape the Donut Holes</h3>
    <p>Using a small cookie scoop or your hands, shape the dough into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Place the dough balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Fry the Donut Holes</h3>
    <p>Heat oil in a deep fryer or a heavy-bottomed pot to 350°F (175°C). Carefully drop the dough balls into the hot oil, frying them in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry for about 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown, turning occasionally to ensure even cooking. Remove the donut holes with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Coat with Cinnamon Sugar</h3>
    <p>While the donut holes are still warm, roll them in a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. This will give them a sweet, crispy coating that’s absolutely irresistible.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cinnamon Donut Holes</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free donut holes can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to achieve perfect results every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense, tough donut holes. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor the oil temperature:</strong> If the oil is too hot, the donut holes will burn on the outside while remaining raw on the inside. If it’s too cool, they’ll absorb too much oil and become greasy.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with toppings:</strong> While cinnamon sugar is a classic choice, you can also try glazing your donut holes with chocolate, vanilla, or even a maple glaze for a different flavor profile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cinnamon Donut Holes</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I bake these donut holes instead of frying them?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can bake gluten-free cinnamon donut holes if you prefer a healthier option. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and bake the donut holes on a parchment-lined baking sheet for about 10-12 minutes, or until they’re golden brown. Keep in mind that baked donut holes will have a slightly different texture than fried ones.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these donut holes ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. When you’re ready to cook, simply shape the dough into balls and fry or bake as directed. You can also freeze the cooked donut holes for up to a month. Just reheat them in the oven before serving.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour to use?</h3>
        <p>For the best results, use a gluten-free flour blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten. Popular brands include Bob’s Red Mill and King Arthur Flour. If your blend doesn’t contain xanthan gum, you may need to add about ½ teaspoon to the recipe.</p>
