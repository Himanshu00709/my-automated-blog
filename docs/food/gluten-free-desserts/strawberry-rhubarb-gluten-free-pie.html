    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Pie Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by making the pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Divide the dough into two equal portions, shape them into discs, wrap them in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the filling. In a large bowl, combine the sliced strawberries, chopped rhubarb, granulated sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Mix well to ensure that the fruit is evenly coated. Set the filling aside to allow the flavors to meld while you roll out the dough.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out one disc of dough on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking) to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Carefully transfer the dough to the pie dish and press it into the bottom and sides. Pour the prepared filling into the crust. Roll out the second disc of dough and place it over the filling. You can create a lattice pattern or simply cover the pie with the dough, cutting a few slits in the top to allow steam to escape. Trim and crimp the edges to seal the pie.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Pie</h3>
    <p>Place the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips and bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. If the edges of the crust begin to brown too quickly, cover them with aluminum foil to prevent burning. Once baked, remove the pie from the oven and let it cool completely before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Strawberry Rhubarb Pie</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use frozen strawberries and rhubarb?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries and rhubarb if fresh ones are not available. However, be sure to thaw and drain them thoroughly before using to prevent the pie from becoming too watery.</p>

        <h3>2. What is the best gluten-free flour blend for pie crust?</h3>
        <p>There are several gluten-free flour blends available, but a blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch tends to work well for pie crusts. You can also make your own blend by combining these flours in equal parts.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make the pie crust ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the pie crust ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Just be sure to let it thaw in the refrigerator before rolling it out.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store leftover pie?</h3>
        <p>Leftover pie can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To maintain the crust’s texture, cover the pie loosely with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. You can also freeze the pie for up to 2 months, but be sure to wrap it tightly to prevent freezer burn.</p>
