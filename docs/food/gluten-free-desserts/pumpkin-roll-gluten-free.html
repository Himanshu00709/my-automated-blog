    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Pumpkin Cake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a 15x10-inch jelly roll pan with parchment paper and lightly grease it. In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt. In a separate large bowl, beat the eggs and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the pumpkin puree and mix until well combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.</p>

    <h3>2. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Bake the cake for 12-15 minutes, or until the top springs back when lightly touched. While the cake is baking, lay out a clean kitchen towel and dust it generously with powdered sugar. Once the cake is done, immediately invert it onto the towel. Carefully peel off the parchment paper, then roll the cake up in the towel, starting from the short end. Let it cool completely on a wire rack.</p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Cream Cheese Filling</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar, beating until the filling is creamy and well combined.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Pumpkin Roll</h3>
    <p>Once the cake has cooled, carefully unroll it from the towel. Spread the cream cheese filling evenly over the cake, leaving a small border around the edges. Gently roll the cake back up, this time without the towel. Wrap the pumpkin roll in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll the cake while it's warm:</strong> Rolling the cake while it's still warm helps prevent cracking. Be sure to dust the towel with powdered sugar to avoid sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill before serving:</strong> Chilling the pumpkin roll allows the flavors to meld and makes it easier to slice.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>Can I make this pumpkin roll ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make the pumpkin roll a day in advance. Simply wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator. It will stay fresh for up to 3 days.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze a gluten-free pumpkin roll?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Wrap the pumpkin roll tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. It can be frozen for up to 2 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator before serving.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of cream cheese for the filling?</h3>
        <p>If you're looking for a dairy-free alternative, you can use a vegan cream cheese substitute. Just make sure it has a similar consistency to regular cream cheese.</p>

        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin puree?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh pumpkin puree. Just make sure it's smooth and free of excess moisture. You may need to strain it to achieve the right consistency.</p>
