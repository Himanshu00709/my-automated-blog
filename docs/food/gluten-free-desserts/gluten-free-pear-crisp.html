    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pears</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Peel and core the pears, then slice them into thin wedges. Toss the pear slices with lemon juice in a large bowl to prevent browning and add a hint of tanginess.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free oats, almond flour, coconut sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of the spices. Cut the cold butter into small pieces and add it to the mixture. Use your fingers or a pastry cutter to blend the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Crisp</h3>
    <p>Transfer the prepared pear slices to a baking dish, spreading them out evenly. Sprinkle the oat mixture over the pears, covering them completely. Press the topping down gently to create a compact layer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the pears are tender. The aroma of cinnamon and baked pears will fill your kitchen, signaling that your gluten-free pear crisp is ready.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the crisp to cool slightly before serving. It pairs wonderfully with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. Enjoy this warm, comforting dessert that’s both delicious and gluten-free!</p>
