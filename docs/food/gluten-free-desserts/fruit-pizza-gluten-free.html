    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, softened butter, sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Mix until a dough forms. Press the dough into a greased pizza pan or baking sheet, shaping it into a round crust. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the crust to cool completely.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Creamy Layer:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the softened cream cheese, Greek yogurt, and honey until smooth and creamy. Spread this mixture evenly over the cooled crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Fruits:</strong> Wash and slice your chosen fruits. Arrange them on top of the creamy layer in a decorative pattern. You can create concentric circles, a rainbow design, or simply scatter the fruits for a more rustic look.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill and Serve:</strong> Refrigerate the fruit pizza for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Slice and serve chilled.</li>
