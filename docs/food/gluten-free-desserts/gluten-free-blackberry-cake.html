    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free blackberry cake is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a cake that is both delicious and visually appealing:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream together the unsalted butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for creating a tender crumb in the cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla extract for added flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in Blackberries</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the fresh blackberries, being careful not to crush them. The blackberries will add bursts of flavor and color throughout the cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra touch of indulgence.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Blackberries</h2>
    <p>Blackberries are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. They are an excellent source of vitamins C and K, as well as dietary fiber, which aids in digestion. Additionally, blackberries are rich in antioxidants, which help protect the body from oxidative stress and inflammation. Incorporating blackberries into your diet, whether in a cake or as a snack, can provide numerous health benefits.</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>Can I use frozen blackberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blackberries if fresh ones are not available. However, be sure to thaw and drain them thoroughly before adding them to the batter to prevent excess moisture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the unsalted butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter, to make the cake dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute blackberries with other berries, such as raspberries or blueberries, or even use a combination of different fruits for a unique flavor profile.</p>
