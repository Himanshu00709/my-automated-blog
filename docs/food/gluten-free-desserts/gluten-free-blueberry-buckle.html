    <h1>Gluten-Free Blueberry Buckle: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>If you're looking for a delightful dessert that's both gluten-free and bursting with flavor, look no further than the gluten-free blueberry buckle. This classic dessert combines the sweetness of blueberries with a tender, crumbly cake base, making it a perfect treat for any occasion. Whether you're gluten-intolerant or simply looking to explore healthier dessert options, this recipe is sure to satisfy your sweet tooth.</p>

    <h2>What is a Blueberry Buckle?</h2>
    <p>A blueberry buckle is a type of coffee cake that features a layer of cake topped with fresh blueberries and a streusel-like crumb topping. As the cake bakes, the blueberries sink into the batter, creating a "buckled" appearance, hence the name. The result is a moist, flavorful cake with a delightful contrast of textures—soft cake, juicy berries, and a crunchy topping.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has gained popularity in recent years, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also among health-conscious individuals. Gluten-free diets can help reduce inflammation, improve digestion, and promote overall well-being. By using gluten-free flours and ingredients, you can enjoy your favorite desserts without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free blueberry buckle:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch square baking pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the Blueberries:</strong> Gently fold the fresh blueberries into the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Topping:</strong> In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar and cinnamon.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Buckle:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and sprinkle the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture evenly over the top.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the buckle to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Blueberry Buckle</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Blueberries:</strong> Fresh blueberries are ideal for this recipe, but frozen blueberries can also be used. If using frozen, do not thaw them before adding to the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense cake. Mix until just combined to ensure a light and tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flours:</strong> Feel free to experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as oat flour or coconut flour, to find the texture and flavor you prefer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add a Citrus Twist:</strong> For an extra burst of flavor, add the zest of a lemon or orange to the batter.</li>
    </ul>
