    <h1>Gluten-Free Oreo Cheesecake: A Delicious Dessert for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Cheesecake is a timeless dessert that has been enjoyed by people all over the world for centuries. Its creamy texture and rich flavor make it a favorite for many.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (163°C). Crush 24 gluten-free Oreo cookies into fine crumbs using a food processor or by placing them in a zip-top bag and crushing them with a rolling pin. Mix the crumbs with the melted butter until well combined. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, ensuring an even layer. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Cheesecake Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the granulated sugar, mixing until fully incorporated. Add the sour cream and vanilla extract, and mix until smooth. Finally, add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Be careful not to overmix, as this can incorporate too much air and cause the cheesecake to crack during baking.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the cheesecake filling over the cooled crust, spreading it evenly. Sprinkle the crushed gluten-free Oreo cookies on top for added texture and flavor. Place the springform pan in a larger baking dish and fill the dish with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the springform pan. This water bath helps to prevent the cheesecake from cracking. Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle.</p>

    <h3>4. Cool and Chill</h3>
    <p>Once baked, turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the door slightly ajar for about an hour. This gradual cooling process helps to prevent cracks. After an hour, remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature. Once cooled, refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow it to set completely.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Oreo Cheesecake</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Ensure that your cream cheese, eggs, and sour cream are at room temperature before mixing. This helps to create a smooth and lump-free filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Overmixing:</strong> Overmixing the batter can incorporate too much air, leading to cracks during baking. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Water Bath:</strong> Don’t skip the water bath! It’s essential for even baking and preventing cracks.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill Thoroughly:</strong> Allow the cheesecake to chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or overnight, to ensure it sets properly.</li>
    </ul>
