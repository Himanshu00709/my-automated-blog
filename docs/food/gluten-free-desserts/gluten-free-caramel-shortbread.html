    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Shortbread Base</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 180°C (160°C fan) and lining a baking tin with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, cold unsalted butter, and caster sugar. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Press the mixture firmly into the prepared tin, ensuring an even layer. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the shortbread is golden brown. Allow it to cool completely before adding the caramel layer.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Caramel Layer</h3>

    <p>In a saucepan, combine the condensed milk, golden syrup, and unsalted butter. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring continuously, until it thickens and turns a rich golden color. This should take about 10-15 minutes. Be careful not to let the caramel burn. Once the caramel is ready, pour it over the cooled shortbread base and spread it evenly. Allow the caramel to set for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>3. Adding the Chocolate Topping</h3>

    <p>Break the dark chocolate into pieces and melt it in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, or in the microwave in short bursts. Once the chocolate is melted and smooth, pour it over the set caramel layer. Use a spatula to spread the chocolate evenly. Allow the chocolate to set completely before cutting the shortbread into squares or rectangles.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Caramel Shortbread</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours such as almond flour or oat flour, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly. It's best to use a gluten-free flour blend specifically designed for baking to achieve the best results.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative and use dairy-free condensed milk and chocolate. Just make sure to check the labels to ensure all ingredients are gluten-free and dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free caramel shortbread?</h3>
        <p>Store the shortbread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. If the weather is warm, you may want to keep it in the refrigerator to prevent the chocolate from melting.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free caramel shortbread?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the shortbread for up to 3 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer-safe container. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>
