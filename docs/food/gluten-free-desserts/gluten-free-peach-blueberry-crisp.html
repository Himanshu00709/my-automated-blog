    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make this gluten-free peach blueberry crisp.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This will ensure that your crisp bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown topping.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Fruit Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced peaches and blueberries. Add the lemon juice and honey (or maple syrup) to the fruit mixture. Gently toss the fruit until it is evenly coated. The lemon juice will enhance the natural flavors of the fruit, while the honey will add a touch of sweetness.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Crisp Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free oats, almond flour, melted coconut oil, cinnamon, and salt. Stir until the mixture is well combined and forms a crumbly texture. This will be your crisp topping, which will add a delightful crunch to the dessert.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Transfer the fruit mixture to a baking dish, spreading it out evenly. Sprinkle the crisp topping over the fruit, ensuring that it covers the entire surface. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the crisp is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Serve it warm, either on its own or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. Enjoy the delightful combination of sweet peaches, tangy blueberries, and crunchy topping!</p>
