    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (163°C). In a medium bowl, combine the crushed gluten-free graham crackers with the melted butter. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, ensuring an even layer. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Cheesecake Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar, mixing until fully incorporated. Add the vanilla extract and eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Pour the filling over the cooled crust, spreading it evenly.</p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Apple Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, toss the sliced apples with cinnamon and lemon juice. Arrange the apple slices on top of the cheesecake filling in a decorative pattern. You can layer them in concentric circles or create a more rustic look by scattering them randomly.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Cheesecake</h3>
    <p>Place the cheesecake in the preheated oven and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door slightly ajar for about an hour. This helps prevent cracking.</p>

    <h3>5. Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the cheesecake has cooled to room temperature, transfer it to the refrigerator and let it chill for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. This allows the flavors to meld and the cheesecake to set completely. When ready to serve, remove the cheesecake from the springform pan, slice, and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this cheesecake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this cheesecake dairy-free by using dairy-free cream cheese and substituting the butter with coconut oil or a dairy-free margarine. Be sure to check the labels to ensure all ingredients are dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While apples are a classic choice, you can experiment with other fruits like pears, peaches, or berries. Just adjust the sugar and spice levels accordingly to complement the fruit you choose.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover cheesecake?</h3>
        <p>Leftover cheesecake should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will keep for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cheesecake for up to 2 months. To serve, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cheesecake ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this cheesecake is an excellent make-ahead dessert. It actually tastes better after chilling overnight, as the flavors have more time to develop. Just be sure to cover it well to prevent it from absorbing any odors from the refrigerator.</p>
