    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with butter or a non-stick cooking spray.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Fruit Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced peaches, blueberries, ½ cup of sugar, and lemon juice. Toss gently to coat the fruit evenly. Let the mixture sit for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</p>

    <h3>3. Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, remaining ½ cup of sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the almond milk and vanilla extract until just combined.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the fruit mixture into the prepared baking dish. Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler topping evenly over the fruit. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling.</p>

    <h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cobbler to cool slightly before serving. It pairs wonderfully with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra treat.</p>
