            <tr>
                <td>Don't Overmix the Batter</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Use Fresh Ingredients</td>
                <td>Fresh spices, baking powder, and baking soda are essential for achieving the best flavor and rise in your gluten-free desserts.</td>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fall Desserts</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour in these recipes?</h3>
        <p>No, regular flour contains gluten, which is a protein that gives structure to baked goods. Using gluten-free flour is essential for those who need to avoid gluten. However, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends to find the one that works best for your recipe.</p>

        <h3>2. Are gluten-free desserts healthier than regular desserts?</h3>
        <p>Not necessarily. While gluten-free desserts can be a healthier option for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, they can still be high in sugar and calories. It's important to enjoy them in moderation as part of a balanced diet.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make these desserts dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, many gluten-free desserts can easily be made dairy-free by substituting ingredients like butter with coconut oil or vegan butter, and milk with almond milk or another plant-based milk.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store gluten-free baked goods?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free baked goods tend to dry out faster than traditional baked goods. Store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for longer storage.</p>
