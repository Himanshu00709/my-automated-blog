    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free apple tart.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by making the crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and sugar. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add a tablespoon of cold water at a time, mixing until the dough comes together. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Apples</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, peel and slice the apples thinly. Toss the apple slices with lemon juice, sugar, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Set aside to allow the flavors to meld.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Tart</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) to fit your tart pan. Carefully transfer the dough to the pan, pressing it into the edges. Arrange the apple slices in a circular pattern over the crust, starting from the outside and working your way in.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Tart</h3>
    <p>Brush the edges of the crust with an egg wash for a golden finish. Bake the tart in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the apples are tender. Allow the tart to cool slightly before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use any type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>While you can use any gluten-free flour, it's best to use a blend specifically designed for baking. These blends often include xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this tart ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the tart up to a day in advance. Store it in an airtight container at room temperature. If you prefer to serve it warm, simply reheat it in the oven for a few minutes before serving.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I freeze the gluten-free apple tart?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can freeze the baked tart for up to 2 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and reheat in the oven before serving.</p>
    </div>
