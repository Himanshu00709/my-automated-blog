    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (163°C). In a medium bowl, combine the crushed gluten-free graham crackers with the melted butter. Mix until the crumbs are evenly coated. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, making sure to create an even layer. Bake the crust for about 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Cheesecake Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until it's smooth and creamy. Gradually add the granulated sugar, continuing to beat until well combined. Next, add the pumpkin puree, eggs, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt. Mix until all the ingredients are fully incorporated and the filling is smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Cheesecake</h3>
    <p>Pour the cheesecake filling over the cooled crust in the springform pan. Smooth the top with a spatula to ensure an even layer. Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 50-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool inside with the door slightly ajar for about an hour. This helps prevent cracking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the cheesecake has cooled, remove it from the oven and let it come to room temperature. Then, cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight, to allow it to set completely. When you're ready to serve, carefully remove the cheesecake from the springform pan, slice, and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular graham crackers instead of gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have a gluten intolerance, you can certainly use regular graham crackers for the crust. However, if you're serving this dessert to someone with gluten sensitivity, it's important to stick with gluten-free graham crackers to ensure the entire dish is safe for them to eat.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cheesecake ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! In fact, this cheesecake tastes even better when made a day in advance. The flavors have more time to meld together, and the texture becomes even creamier. Just make sure to store it in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this cheesecake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze this gluten-free pumpkin cheesecake. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn. It can be stored in the freezer for up to 2 months. When you're ready to enjoy it, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>
