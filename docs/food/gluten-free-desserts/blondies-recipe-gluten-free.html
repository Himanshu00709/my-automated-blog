    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your blondies bake evenly and achieve the perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Baking Pan</h3>
    <p>Line an 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper or lightly grease it with butter. This will prevent the blondies from sticking to the pan and make it easier to remove them once they’re baked.</p>

    <h3>3. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. This step ensures that the dry ingredients are evenly distributed, which is crucial for achieving a consistent texture in your blondies.</p>

    <h3>4. Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate large bowl, mix the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Finally, stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense blondies. If you’re using chocolate chips or other add-ins, fold them in at this stage.</p>

    <h3>6. Bake the Blondies</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs.</p>

    <h3>7. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the blondies to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, cut them into squares and serve.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Blondies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense blondies. Mix until just combined to ensure a light and chewy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to customize your blondies with your favorite add-ins, such as nuts, dried fruit, or white chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Blondies are done when the edges are golden brown and the center is set. Avoid overbaking to prevent dry blondies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as oat flour or coconut flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary depending on the flour you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these blondies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter, to make the recipe dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free blondies?</h3>
        <p>Store the blondies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 2 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I reduce the sugar in this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can reduce the amount of sugar if you prefer a less sweet treat. However, keep in mind that sugar contributes to the texture and moisture of the blondies, so reducing it may affect the final result.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free blondies are a delightful treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and a few simple steps, you can create a batch of blondies that are just as delicious as their traditional counterparts. Whether you’re serving them at a party, enjoying them as a snack, or indulging in a sweet dessert, these gluten-free blondies are sure to satisfy your cravings.
