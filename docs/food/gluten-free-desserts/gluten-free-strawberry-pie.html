<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Gluten-Free Pie Crust</h3>

<p>If you’re using a store-bought gluten-free pie crust, follow the package instructions for pre-baking. If you’re making your own, combine 1 1/2 cups of gluten-free flour (such as almond or rice flour), 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 cup of cold butter (cut into small pieces), and 3-4 tablespoons of ice water in a food processor. Pulse until the mixture forms a dough. Roll out the dough on a floured surface and press it into a pie dish. Pre-bake the crust at 375°F (190°C) for about 10 minutes, or until lightly golden.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Strawberry Filling</h3>

<p>Wash and hull the strawberries, then slice them into halves or quarters, depending on their size. In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and water. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and becomes translucent. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Gently fold in the strawberries, ensuring they are evenly coated with the glaze.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble the Pie</h3>

<p>Pour the strawberry filling into the pre-baked gluten-free pie crust. Spread the strawberries evenly and allow the pie to cool at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Once cooled, refrigerate the pie for at least 2 hours to allow the filling to set.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Before serving, you can top the pie with whipped cream or a dollop of vanilla ice cream for an extra touch of indulgence. Slice the pie into wedges and enjoy your gluten-free strawberry creation!</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Strawberry Pie</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen strawberries instead of fresh ones?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries, but make sure to thaw and drain them thoroughly before using. Frozen strawberries may release more liquid, so you might need to adjust the amount of cornstarch to achieve the desired consistency.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>What can I use instead of cornstarch as a thickener?</h3>
    <p>If you prefer not to use cornstarch, you can substitute it with arrowroot powder or tapioca starch. Both are excellent gluten-free thickeners and will work well in this recipe.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make this pie ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! This pie can be made a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator. Just make sure to cover it with plastic wrap or place it in an airtight container to prevent it from absorbing any odors.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Is this pie suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>This recipe can be made vegan by using a vegan gluten-free pie crust and substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative. Additionally, ensure that the sugar used is vegan-friendly, as some sugars are processed with bone char.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free strawberry pie is a delightful dessert that proves you don’t have to sacrifice flavor for health. Whether you’re catering to dietary restrictions or simply exploring new baking techniques, this recipe offers a delicious way to enjoy the classic combination of strawberries and pie crust. With its vibrant color, sweet taste, and gluten-free goodness, this pie is sure to become a favorite at your table.
