<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions for making this delicious gluten-free upside-down apple cake.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with butter or a non-stick cooking spray. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper to ensure the cake comes out easily after baking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Apples</h3>
<p>Peel, core, and thinly slice the apples. In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar and cinnamon. Arrange the apple slices in a single layer at the bottom of the prepared cake pan. Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over the apples. This will create a caramelized topping once the cake is baked and flipped.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Make the Batter</h3>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. In a separate large bowl, cream the butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix the batter.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Bake the Cake</h3>
<p>Pour the batter over the arranged apples in the cake pan, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. The top of the cake should be golden brown, and the apples should be tender and caramelized.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Cool and Flip</h3>
<p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, carefully run a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the cake. Place a serving plate upside down over the cake pan, and quickly flip the pan and plate together. Gently lift the pan off the cake, revealing the beautiful caramelized apple topping. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! While apples are the traditional choice for an upside-down cake, you can experiment with other fruits like pears, peaches, or even pineapple. Just make sure to adjust the baking time accordingly, as different fruits may release more or less moisture during baking.</p>

    <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour blend to use?</h3>
    <p>There are many gluten-free flour blends available on the market, and the best one to use depends on your personal preference. Look for a blend that contains a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch, as these tend to produce a light and fluffy texture. You can also make your own blend at home if you prefer.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can easily make this cake dairy-free by substituting the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and using a non-dairy milk such as almond milk or oat milk. The result will be just as delicious!</p>

    <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
    <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply warm individual slices in the microwave or oven.</p>
