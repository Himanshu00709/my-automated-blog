    <h1>Blueberry Gluten-Free Pie: A Delicious and Healthy Dessert</h1>
    <p>When it comes to desserts, few things are as comforting and satisfying as a slice of pie. But for those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding a pie that meets dietary restrictions without sacrificing flavor can be a challenge. Enter the <strong>blueberry gluten-free pie</strong>—a delightful treat that combines the natural sweetness of blueberries with a flaky, gluten-free crust. Whether you're gluten-intolerant or simply looking for a healthier dessert option, this pie is sure to impress.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Pie?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity in recent years, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals seeking healthier eating habits. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and inflammation in some people. By opting for a gluten-free pie, you can enjoy a delicious dessert without the discomfort or health risks associated with gluten consumption.</p>

    <h2>The Perfect Gluten-Free Crust</h2>
    <p>The key to a great gluten-free pie lies in the crust. Traditional pie crusts rely on wheat flour for their structure and flakiness, but with the right combination of gluten-free flours and binders, you can achieve a crust that is just as delicious. Here’s a simple recipe for a gluten-free pie crust:</p>

            <td>1/2 cup</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, rice flour, tapioca flour, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Gradually add cold water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough.</li>
        <li>Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) and transfer it to a pie dish. Trim the edges and crimp as desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Blueberry Filling</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your gluten-free crust ready, it’s time to prepare the star of the show—the blueberry filling. Blueberries are not only delicious but also packed with antioxidants, vitamins, and fiber, making them a nutritious addition to your dessert.</p>

            <th>Quantity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Fresh blueberries</td>
            <td>4 cups</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Granulated sugar</td>
            <td>1/2 cup</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cornstarch</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Vanilla extract</td>
            <td>1 teaspoon</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Mix well to ensure the blueberries are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Pour the blueberry mixture into the prepared gluten-free pie crust.</li>
        <li>If desired, you can add a lattice top or a full crust on top of the filling. Be sure to cut slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.</li>
        <li>Bake the pie in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</li>
        <li>Allow the pie to cool completely before serving to allow the filling to set.</li>
    </ol>
