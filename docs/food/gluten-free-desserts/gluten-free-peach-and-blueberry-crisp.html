<h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Dessert?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity over the years, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also among individuals looking to improve their overall health.

By opting for gluten-free desserts, you can enjoy your favorite treats without the discomfort or health risks associated with gluten consumption.</p>

<p>Moreover, gluten-free baking often incorporates nutrient-dense ingredients like almond flour, oats, and coconut oil, which can add extra fiber, healthy fats, and vitamins to your diet. This peach and blueberry crisp is a perfect example of how gluten-free desserts can be both delicious and nutritious.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make this delightful gluten-free peach and blueberry crisp.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C). This ensures that your crisp bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown topping.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Fruit Filling</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced peaches, blueberries, lemon juice, granulated sugar, and cornstarch. Gently toss the fruits until they are evenly coated with the sugar and cornstarch mixture. This will help thicken the filling as it bakes, creating a luscious, gooey texture.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Make the Crisp Topping</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, mix together the gluten-free rolled oats, almond flour, brown sugar, ground cinnamon, and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter to the mixture and use your fingers or a pastry cutter to work the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. This crumbly topping will give your crisp its signature texture.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>
<p>Transfer the fruit mixture to a greased baking dish, spreading it out evenly. Sprinkle the crisp topping over the fruit, covering it completely. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit filling is bubbling.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Allow the crisp to cool for a few minutes before serving. You can enjoy it as is or top it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra indulgent treat.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen fruit instead of fresh?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen peaches and blueberries if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them well before using to prevent excess moisture in the filling.</p>

    <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>This recipe can be made vegan by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan margarine. Ensure that all other ingredients, like the sugar, are also vegan-friendly.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this crisp ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the crisp up to a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. When ready to serve, simply reheat it in the oven at 350째F (175째C) for about 10-15 minutes, or until warmed through.</p>

    <h3>What other fruits can I use in this recipe?</h3>
    <p>This recipe is versatile and can be adapted to include other fruits like apples, strawberries, or blackberries. Feel free to experiment with your favorite combinations!</p>
