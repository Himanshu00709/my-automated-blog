    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free Italian Rainbow Cookies is a labor of love, but the results are well worth the effort. Follow these steps to create your own batch:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Batter:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the almond paste, butter, and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the almond extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Whip the Egg Whites:</strong> In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the egg whites into the almond mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Flour:</strong> Gradually add the gluten-free flour to the batter, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Divide and Color:</strong> Divide the batter into three equal parts. Color one part red, one part green, and leave the third part plain.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Layers:</strong> Spread each colored batter into a separate parchment-lined baking pan. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 10-12 minutes, or until the layers are set but not browned.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Cookies:</strong> Once cooled, spread apricot jam between the layers, stacking them in the order of red, white, and green. Place a heavy object on top to compress the layers for a few hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat with Chocolate:</strong> Melt the dark chocolate and spread it over the top and sides of the assembled layers. Allow the chocolate to set before cutting into small rectangles.</li>
    </ol>
