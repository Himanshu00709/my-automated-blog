<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Batter</h3>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond paste, butter, and sugar. Beat until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Stir in the almond extract.</p>

<h3>2. Divide and Color the Batter</h3>
<p>Divide the batter evenly into three separate bowls. Add red food coloring to one bowl and green food coloring to another, leaving the third bowl uncolored. Mix each bowl until the colors are evenly distributed.</p>

<h3>3. Bake the Layers</h3>
<p>Line three 9x13-inch baking pans with parchment paper and lightly grease them. Spread each colored batter evenly into its own pan. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the layers are set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the layers to cool completely in the pans.</p>

<h3>4. Assemble the Cookies</h3>
<p>Once the layers are cool, spread a thin layer of apricot or raspberry jam on top of the green layer. Carefully place the white layer on top of the green layer and spread another thin layer of jam on top. Finally, place the red layer on top of the white layer. Press the layers together gently but firmly. Wrap the assembled layers in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until firm.</p>

<h3>5. Coat with Chocolate</h3>
<p>Melt the dark chocolate in a double boiler or microwave. Remove the assembled layers from the refrigerator and trim the edges to create a neat rectangle. Cut the rectangle into individual cookies. Dip each cookie into the melted chocolate, coating the top and sides. Place the cookies on a wire rack to allow the chocolate to set.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of jam?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use any type of jam you prefer. Apricot and raspberry are traditional choices, but feel free to experiment with other flavors like strawberry or blackberry.</p>

    <h3>How should I store gluten-free Italian Rainbow Cookies?</h3>
    <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or margarine. Just make sure to use a dairy-free chocolate for coating as well.</p>

    <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best?</h3>
    <p>A blend of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch works well for these cookies. You can also use a pre-made gluten-free flour blend from the store.</p>
