<h1>Gluten-Free Dutch Oven Peach Cobbler: A Delicious Summer Dessert</h1>

<p>When it comes to summer desserts, few things can beat the comforting taste of a warm peach cobbler. But what if you're following a gluten-free diet? Fear not! This gluten-free Dutch oven peach cobbler is here to satisfy your sweet tooth without compromising your dietary needs. Made with fresh peaches, a gluten-free flour blend, and baked to perfection in a Dutch oven, this dessert is a crowd-pleaser that everyone can enjoy.</p>

<h2>Why Choose a Dutch Oven for Baking?</h2>

<p>Dutch ovens are versatile kitchen tools that are perfect for baking, especially when it comes to desserts like cobblers. The heavy cast iron construction ensures even heat distribution, which is crucial for achieving a perfectly baked cobbler. The lid traps moisture, creating a steamy environment that helps the peaches soften and the topping to become golden and crispy. Plus, Dutch ovens are incredibly durable and can be used on the stovetop, in the oven, or even over a campfire, making them ideal for outdoor cooking adventures.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Peaches</h3>

<p>Start by peeling and slicing the fresh peaches. If you prefer, you can leave the skins on for added texture and nutrients. In a large bowl, toss the peach slices with 1/2 cup of granulated sugar and let them sit for about 15 minutes. This will help draw out the natural juices, creating a delicious syrup for your cobbler.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, salt, and the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a tough topping.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble the Cobbler</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer the peach mixture to your Dutch oven, spreading it out evenly. Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler topping over the peaches, leaving some space between each dollop. Sprinkle the top with ground cinnamon for added flavor.</p>

<h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>

<p>Cover the Dutch oven with its lid and bake for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, remove the lid and continue baking for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the peaches are bubbling. The aroma filling your kitchen will be irresistible!</p>

<h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>

<p>This gluten-free Dutch oven peach cobbler is best served warm, straight from the oven. For an extra indulgent treat, top it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. The contrast between the warm cobbler and the cold ice cream is simply divine. If you're serving a crowd, consider doubling the recipe—this dessert tends to disappear quickly!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen peaches instead of fresh?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen peaches if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in your cobbler.</p>

    <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best?</h3>
    <p>Any high-quality gluten-free flour blend should work well. Look for one that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten. Popular brands include Bob's Red Mill and King Arthur Flour.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this cobbler dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a dairy-free milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
