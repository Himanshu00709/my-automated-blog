    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by making the gluten-free crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, granulated sugar, and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Preparing the Plum Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the plum filling. Wash and slice the plums into thin wedges, removing the pits. In a separate bowl, mix the plum slices with brown sugar, cinnamon (if using), and lemon juice. Set aside to allow the flavors to meld.</p>

    <h3>3. Assembling the Tart</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking) into a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Carefully transfer the dough to a tart pan, pressing it gently into the edges. Trim any excess dough. Arrange the plum slices in a circular pattern over the crust, starting from the outside and working your way in. Sprinkle any remaining sugar mixture over the plums.</p>

    <h3>4. Baking the Tart</h3>
    <p>Bake the tart in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the plums are tender. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving. For an extra touch, you can dust the tart with powdered sugar or serve it with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use other fruits instead of plums?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While plums are the star of this recipe, you can easily substitute them with other fruits like peaches, apricots, or even apples. Just adjust the sugar and spices accordingly to complement the fruit you choose.</p>

        <h3>How do I store the gluten-free plum tart?</h3>
        <p>Store the tart in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. If you need to store it longer, refrigerate it for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the tart for up to 3 months. Just make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the crust ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the crust ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or freeze it for up to 3 months. If you freeze the dough, make sure to thaw it in the refrigerator before rolling it out.</p>
