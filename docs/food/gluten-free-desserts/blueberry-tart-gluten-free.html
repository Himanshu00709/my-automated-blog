    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free blueberry tart is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a dessert that will impress your family and friends:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a food processor, combine the gluten-free flour blend, cold butter, sugar, and salt. Pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press the dough into a tart pan, making sure to evenly distribute it across the bottom and up the sides. Bake the crust for about 15 minutes, or until it’s lightly golden. Let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Blueberry Filling</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, combine the blueberries, lemon zest, cornstarch, and honey or maple syrup. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the blueberries release their juices and the mixture thickens. This should take about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Tart</h3>
    <p>Once the crust has cooled, pour the blueberry filling into the tart shell, spreading it evenly. You can garnish the tart with additional fresh blueberries or a sprinkle of lemon zest for an extra touch of flavor. Chill the tart in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving to allow the filling to set.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Blueberry Tart</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free blueberry tart turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use cold butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for creating a flaky crust. Make sure your butter is straight from the fridge.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a tough crust. Pulse the ingredients just until they come together.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the filling cool:</strong> Allowing the blueberry filling to cool slightly before pouring it into the crust will prevent the crust from becoming soggy.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill before serving:</strong> Chilling the tart helps the filling set and makes it easier to slice.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Blueberry Tart</h2>
        <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in the filling.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of honey or maple syrup?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer, you can use granulated sugar or a sugar substitute like stevia. Adjust the quantity to taste.</p>

        <h3>How long does the tart last?</h3>
        <p>The tart can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the crust ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the crust a day in advance. Simply wrap it in plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator until you’re ready to bake.</p>
