<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Gulab Jamun</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Sugar Syrup</h3>
<p>In a saucepan, combine sugar and water. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely. Add cardamom powder and rose water or saffron strands for added flavor. Simmer the syrup for 5-7 minutes until it slightly thickens. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Make the Gulab Jamun Dough</h3>
<p>In a mixing bowl, combine gluten-free flour, khoya (or milk powder), and baking powder. Mix well to ensure there are no lumps. Add ghee and mix until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Gradually add milk, a little at a time, and knead the mixture into a soft, smooth dough. Be careful not to over-knead, as this can make the Gulab Jamun dense.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Shape the Gulab Jamun</h3>
<p>Divide the dough into small, equal-sized portions. Roll each portion into smooth, crack-free balls. Ensure the balls are uniform in size to ensure even cooking.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Fry the Gulab Jamun</h3>
<p>Heat ghee or oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, reduce the heat to low and gently add the Gulab Jamun balls. Fry them slowly, turning occasionally, until they turn golden brown. This slow frying process ensures that the Gulab Jamun cook evenly and remain soft inside.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Soak the Gulab Jamun in Syrup</h3>
<p>Once the Gulab Jamun are fried, drain them on a paper towel to remove excess oil. While they are still warm, transfer them to the prepared sugar syrup. Let them soak for at least 1-2 hours to absorb the syrup and become soft and juicy.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Gulab Jamun</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh khoya or milk powder and gluten-free flour are essential for the best results.</li>
    <li><strong>Control the Heat:</strong> Frying the Gulab Jamun on low heat ensures they cook evenly without burning.</li>
    <li><strong>Soak Well:</strong> Allow the Gulab Jamun to soak in the syrup for at least 1-2 hours to achieve the perfect texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add a pinch of nutmeg or cinnamon to the dough for a unique twist.</li>
</ul>
