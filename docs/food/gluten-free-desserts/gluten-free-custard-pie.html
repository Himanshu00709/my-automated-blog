    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Pie Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by making the gluten-free pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, and salt. Add the cold butter pieces and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has chilled, roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) to fit your pie dish. Carefully transfer the dough to the pie dish, pressing it gently into the bottom and sides. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges as desired. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork to prevent air bubbles during baking.</p>

    <h3>3. Blind Bake the Crust</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C). Line the pie crust with parchment paper and fill it with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove the parchment paper and weights and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the crust is lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly while you prepare the custard filling.</p>

    <h3>4. Make the Custard Filling</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat until it is warm but not boiling. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract until well combined. Slowly pour the warm milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly to prevent the eggs from curdling. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the custard thickens and coats the back of a spoon.</p>

    <h3>5. Assemble and Bake the Pie</h3>
    <p>Pour the custard filling into the pre-baked pie crust. Place the pie in the oven and bake at 350째F (175째C) for 25-30 minutes, or until the custard is set and the top is lightly golden. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool completely before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a store-bought gluten-free pie crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a store-bought gluten-free pie crust if you're short on time. However, making your own crust allows you to control the ingredients and ensure the best flavor and texture.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this pie dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a dairy-free version of this pie by using a dairy-free milk alternative, such as almond milk or coconut milk, and a dairy-free butter substitute for the crust.</p>
    </div>

        <h3>How should I store leftover gluten-free custard pie?</h3>
