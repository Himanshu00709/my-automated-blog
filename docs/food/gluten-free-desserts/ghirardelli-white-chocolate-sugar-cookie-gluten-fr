    <h3>Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In addition to the cookie mix, you’ll need a few basic ingredients that you likely already have in your kitchen:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) of unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the softened butter, egg, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined. Gradually add the Ghirardelli White Chocolate Sugar Cookie Gluten-Free mix and stir until a dough forms. The dough should be soft but not sticky.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape and Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of dough and roll them into balls. Place the dough balls on a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Flatten each ball slightly with the palm of your hand or the bottom of a glass. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
