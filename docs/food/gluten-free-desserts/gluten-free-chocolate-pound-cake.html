    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free chocolate pound cake:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan and line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Vanilla:</strong> Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Chocolate Chips:</strong> Gently fold in the dark chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Baking</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to achieve a perfect gluten-free chocolate pound cake every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking and contains a mix of flours like rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense and tough cake. Mix the ingredients until just combined to ensure a light and tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure Ingredients Accurately:</strong> Baking is a science, and accurate measurements are crucial. Use a kitchen scale for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Cake Cool Completely:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be more delicate when warm. Allow the cake to cool completely before slicing to prevent it from falling apart.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chocolate Pound Cake</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>No, using regular flour will introduce gluten into the recipe, making it unsuitable for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Stick to a gluten-free flour blend for the best results.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I substitute buttermilk with another ingredient?</h3>
        <p>Yes, if you don’t have buttermilk, you can make a substitute by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar to 1 cup of milk. Let it sit for 5 minutes before using.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store the gluten-free chocolate pound cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, wrap the cake tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I add nuts or other mix-ins to the cake?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Feel free to add chopped nuts, dried fruit, or even a swirl of peanut butter to the batter for added flavor and texture.</p>
