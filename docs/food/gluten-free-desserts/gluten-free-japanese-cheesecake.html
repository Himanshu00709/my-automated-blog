    <h1>Gluten-Free Japanese Cheesecake: A Light and Fluffy Delight</h1>

    <p>Japanese cheesecake, often referred to as "cotton cheesecake," is renowned for its light, airy texture and delicate flavor. Unlike traditional cheesecakes, which are dense and rich, Japanese cheesecake is more akin to a soufflé, offering a melt-in-your-mouth experience. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, this dessert can be easily adapted without compromising its signature texture or taste. In this article, we’ll explore the magic of gluten-free Japanese cheesecake, its unique characteristics, and how you can make it at home.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Japanese Cheesecake Unique?</h2>

    <p>Japanese cheesecake stands out due to its unique preparation method. It combines elements of traditional cheesecake with techniques borrowed from soufflés. The result is a cake that is incredibly light, fluffy, and slightly jiggly. The key ingredients include cream cheese, eggs, sugar, and milk, with a small amount of flour typically used to stabilize the structure. However, for a gluten-free version, alternative flours like rice flour or almond flour can be used.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Batter</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 160°C (320°F). In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add the sugar and continue to mix until well combined. Separate the egg yolks from the whites, and add the yolks to the cream cheese mixture one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the milk, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Finally, sift in the gluten-free flour and mix until just combined.</p>

    <h3>2. Whipping the Egg Whites</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks form. This step is crucial for achieving the cake’s signature fluffiness. Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the cream cheese mixture, being careful not to deflate the air bubbles.</p>

    <h3>3. Baking the Cheesecake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into a lined and greased cake pan. Place the pan in a larger baking dish and fill the dish with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the cake pan. This water bath method ensures even baking and prevents cracking. Bake for about 60-70 minutes, or until the top is golden and the center is set but still slightly jiggly.</p>

    <h3>4. Cooling and Serving</h3>
    <p>Once baked, let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door slightly ajar to prevent sudden temperature changes. After cooling, refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. Dust with powdered sugar or top with fresh berries for an elegant finish.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Japanese Cheesecake</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> This ensures a smoother batter and better incorporation of air.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can deflate the egg whites, resulting in a denser cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Baking Time:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so keep an eye on the cake to avoid overbaking.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add matcha powder, cocoa, or citrus zest for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>
