<h2>Tips for Gluten-Free Baking</h2>

<p>Baking gluten-free can be a bit tricky, especially if you're new to it. Here are some tips to help you achieve the best results:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a blend of flours:</strong> Gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour each have different properties. Using a blend can help you achieve a texture that's closer to traditional baked goods.</li>
    <li><strong>Add xanthan gum:</strong> Xanthan gum is a common ingredient in gluten-free baking that helps to bind the ingredients together, mimicking the elasticity that gluten provides.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't overmix:</strong> Overmixing gluten-free batter can lead to a dense and heavy texture. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with moisture:</strong> Gluten-free flours tend to absorb more moisture, so you may need to adjust the amount of liquid in your recipes. Adding ingredients like applesauce or pumpkin puree can help keep your desserts moist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Desserts</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>No, regular flour contains gluten, which is a protein that gives baked goods their structure and elasticity. If you're making gluten-free desserts, it's important to use gluten-free flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or rice flour.</p>

    <h3>2. Are gluten-free desserts healthier?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free desserts can be healthier for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, as they avoid the digestive issues and inflammation caused by gluten. However, gluten-free desserts can still be high in sugar and calories, so it's important to enjoy them in moderation.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make gluten-free desserts vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, many gluten-free desserts can also be made vegan by substituting dairy and eggs with plant-based alternatives. For example, you can use almond milk instead of cow's milk and flaxseed meal instead of eggs.</p>

    <h3>4. What are some common gluten-free flours?</h3>
    <p>Some common gluten-free flours include almond flour, coconut flour, rice flour, tapioca flour, and oat flour (make sure it's certified gluten-free). Each flour has its own unique properties, so it's often best to use a blend for the best results.</p>
