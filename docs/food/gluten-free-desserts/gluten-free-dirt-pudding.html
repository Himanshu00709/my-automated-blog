    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Pudding:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the instant vanilla pudding mix and milk until thickened. Fold in the whipped topping until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Crush the Cookies:</strong> Place the gluten-free chocolate cookies in a resealable plastic bag and crush them using a rolling pin or the bottom of a glass. You want the cookies to resemble dirt, so aim for a fine crumb.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer the Dessert:</strong> In individual serving cups or a large trifle dish, layer the pudding mixture and crushed cookies. Start with a layer of pudding, followed by a layer of cookies, and repeat until the cups are full.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Gummy Worms:</strong> Top the dessert with gummy worms, pushing some into the layers to create the illusion of worms crawling through dirt.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill and Serve:</strong> Refrigerate the dirt pudding for at least 1 hour before serving to allow the flavors to meld and the dessert to set.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Dirt Pudding</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Cookies:</strong> Not all gluten-free cookies are created equal. Look for gluten-free chocolate cookies that have a rich, chocolatey flavor and a crumbly texture. Popular brands include Glutino and Kinnikinnick.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize the Pudding:</strong> While vanilla pudding is traditional, you can experiment with other flavors like chocolate or butterscotch for a unique twist.</li>
        <li><strong>Make it Dairy-Free:</strong> If you're avoiding dairy, use a dairy-free milk alternative like almond or oat milk and a dairy-free whipped topping.</li>
        <li><strong>Get Creative with Toppings:</strong> In addition to gummy worms, consider adding other fun toppings like crushed nuts, sprinkles, or even edible flowers for a more sophisticated presentation.</li>
    </ul>
