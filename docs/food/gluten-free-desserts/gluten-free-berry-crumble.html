<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure that your crumble bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown topping.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Berry Filling</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the mixed berries, lemon juice, and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Toss the berries gently to coat them evenly. The lemon juice will enhance the natural sweetness of the berries and add a subtle tanginess to the filling.</p>

<h3>3. Make the Crumble Topping</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free flour, rolled oats, remaining brown sugar, ground cinnamon, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small pieces and add it to the dry ingredients. Use your fingers or a pastry cutter to blend the butter into the mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. This will create the perfect texture for your crumble topping.</p>

<h3>4. Assemble the Crumble</h3>
<p>Transfer the berry mixture to a baking dish, spreading it out evenly. Sprinkle the crumble topping over the berries, making sure to cover them completely. The topping will crisp up as it bakes, creating a delightful contrast to the soft, juicy berries.</p>

<h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the berry filling is bubbling. The aroma of baked berries and cinnamon will fill your kitchen, making it hard to wait for the crumble to cool!</p>

<h3>6. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once the crumble is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Serve it warm, either on its own or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. The combination of warm berries and cold ice cream is simply divine.</p>

<h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Berry Crumble</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Choose the Right Berries:</strong> You can use any combination of berries you like, such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, or blackberries. Fresh berries are ideal, but frozen berries work just as well and are often more convenient.</li>
    <li><strong>Gluten-Free Flour Options:</strong> Almond flour, oat flour, and rice flour are all excellent choices for a gluten-free crumble. Each flour will give the topping a slightly different texture, so feel free to experiment to find your favorite.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Some Nuts:</strong> For an extra crunch, consider adding chopped nuts like almonds or pecans to the crumble topping. This will add a rich, nutty flavor and make the dessert even more satisfying.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust the Sweetness:</strong> Depending on the sweetness of your berries, you may want to adjust the amount of sugar in the filling. Taste the berries before adding the sugar to ensure the perfect balance of flavors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Berry Crumble</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen berries for this recipe?</h3>
    <p>Yes, frozen berries work perfectly fine for this recipe. Just make sure to thaw them slightly before using, and drain any excess liquid to prevent the filling from becoming too watery.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this crumble dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. The crumble will still turn out deliciously crisp and flavorful.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftover crumble?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover crumble in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat it in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this crumble ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the crumble topping and berry filling separately and store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before assembling and baking. This is a great time-saving tip for entertaining.</p>
