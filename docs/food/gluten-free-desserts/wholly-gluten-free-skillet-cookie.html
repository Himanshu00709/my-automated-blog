    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>No, using regular flour will introduce gluten into the recipe, making it unsuitable for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Stick to certified gluten-free flours for the best results.</p>

        <h3>2. How do I store leftover skillet cookies?</h3>

        <h3>4. What’s the best skillet to use?</h3>
        <p>A cast-iron skillet is ideal for even heat distribution and a crispy edge. However, any oven-safe skillet will work in a pinch.</p>
