<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, granulated sugar, and salt. Cut in the cold butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press the mixture evenly into the bottom of a greased 9x13-inch baking pan. Bake the crust for about 15 minutes, or until it is lightly golden. Remove from the oven and set aside.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, brown sugar, corn syrup, and vanilla extract until well combined. Stir in the chopped pecans. Pour the filling mixture over the pre-baked crust, spreading it evenly with a spatula.</p>

<h3>3. Bake the Bars</h3>

<p>Return the pan to the oven and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes, or until the filling is set and the top is golden brown. Keep an eye on the bars during the last few minutes of baking to prevent over-browning.</p>

<h3>4. Cool and Slice</h3>

<p>Allow the bars to cool completely in the pan before slicing into squares. This will ensure that the filling sets properly and the bars hold their shape. For best results, let the bars cool for at least 2 hours before serving.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pecan Pie Bars</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture and flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't overmix the crust:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a tough crust. Mix just until the ingredients are combined and the dough holds together when pressed.</li>
    <li><strong>Toast the pecans:</strong> For an extra layer of flavor, consider toasting the pecans before adding them to the filling. Simply spread them on a baking sheet and toast in the oven at 350°F for 5-7 minutes, or until fragrant.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the bars cool completely:</strong> Patience is key when it comes to slicing the bars. Allowing them to cool completely will ensure clean, even slices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of nut?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute pecans with other nuts like walnuts or almonds. However, keep in mind that this will alter the traditional flavor of the bars.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these bars ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Gluten-free pecan pie bars can be made a day or two in advance. Store them in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator.</p>

    <h3>Are these bars suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>This recipe contains eggs and butter, so it is not vegan. However, you can experiment with vegan substitutes like flax eggs and plant-based butter to make a vegan version.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free pecan pie bars?</h3>
    <p>Yes, these bars freeze well. Wrap them individually in plastic wrap and store them in a freezer-safe container for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>
