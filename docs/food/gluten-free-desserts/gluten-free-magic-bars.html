        <li><strong>Add the Condensed Milk:</strong> Drizzle the sweetened condensed milk evenly over the top of the layers.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the center is set.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the bars to cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares. Serve and enjoy!</li>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free magic bars turn out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>
