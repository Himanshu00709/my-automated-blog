    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Blondies?</h2>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free peanut butter blondies:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper or lightly grease it to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the wet ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract. Mix until smooth and well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt to the wet ingredients. Stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the blondies tough.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the chocolate chips:</strong> If you're using chocolate chips, gently fold them into the batter until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it out evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the blondies to cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, cut into squares and serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Blondies</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free peanut butter blondies turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use room temperature ingredients:</strong> This helps the ingredients mix more evenly and results in a better texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense and tough blondies. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Ovens can vary, so start checking your blondies at the 20-minute mark. The edges should be golden brown, and a toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean or with a few crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Let them cool:</strong> Allowing the blondies to cool completely before cutting ensures they hold their shape and don't crumble.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond butter instead of peanut butter?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond butter for peanut butter if you prefer or have a peanut allergy. The flavor will be slightly different, but the texture should remain similar.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these blondies vegan?</h3>

        <h3>How should I store these blondies?</h3>
        <p>Store the blondies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other mix-ins?</h3>
