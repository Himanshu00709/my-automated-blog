    <h1>Apple Betty Gluten-Free: A Delicious and Healthy Dessert Option</h1>

    <p>When it comes to desserts, few things are as comforting as a warm, spiced apple dessert. Apple Betty, a classic American dessert, is a perfect example of this. Traditionally made with a buttery crumb topping and layers of spiced apples, it’s a dessert that evokes nostalgia and warmth. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying this classic dessert can be a challenge. That’s where the gluten-free version of Apple Betty comes in. In this blog post, we’ll explore everything you need to know about making a delicious and healthy gluten-free Apple Betty, from the ingredients to the step-by-step process, and even some tips for perfecting the recipe.</p>

    <h2>What is Apple Betty?</h2>

    <p>Apple Betty is a traditional American dessert that dates back to the colonial era. It’s similar to an apple crisp or apple crumble, but with a few key differences. The dessert typically consists of layers of spiced apples topped with a crumbly mixture made from flour, sugar, and butter. The dish is then baked until the apples are tender and the topping is golden and crispy. The result is a dessert that’s both sweet and tart, with a satisfying contrast between the soft apples and the crunchy topping.</p>

    <p>While the traditional recipe calls for wheat flour, making a gluten-free version is easier than you might think. By substituting gluten-free flour and ensuring that all other ingredients are gluten-free, you can enjoy this classic dessert without compromising your dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free Apple Betty:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your dessert bakes evenly and the topping gets crispy.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Apples</h3>
    <p>Peel, core, and slice the apples into thin slices. Toss the apple slices with lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. This will help to enhance the flavor of the apples and prevent them from browning.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Topping</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, rolled oats, and brown sugar. Cut in the cold butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. This crumbly mixture will be the topping for your Apple Betty.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Dessert</h3>
    <p>Spread the prepared apple slices evenly in a baking dish. Sprinkle the crumbly topping mixture over the apples, making sure to cover them completely. You can press the topping down slightly to ensure it sticks to the apples.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the apples are tender. You can test the apples by inserting a knife; it should go through easily.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the Apple Betty to cool slightly before serving. It’s delicious on its own, but you can also serve it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra treat.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfecting Your Gluten-Free Apple Betty</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free Apple Betty turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Apples:</strong> A mix of sweet and tart apples will give your dessert a balanced flavor. Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, and Fuji apples are great options.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for creating a crumbly topping. If the butter is too soft, the topping will be dense rather than light and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Topping:</strong> Mix the topping ingredients just until they come together. Overmixing can result in a tough topping.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the Sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a less sweet dessert, you can reduce the amount of brown sugar in the topping or use a sugar substitute like coconut sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Keep an eye on the dessert as it bakes. If the topping starts to brown too quickly, you can cover it with aluminum foil to prevent burning.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Can I make this dessert dairy-free?</h3>
