<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Crush the gluten-free graham crackers into fine crumbs using a food processor or by placing them in a sealed bag and crushing them with a rolling pin. Mix the crumbs with melted butter until well combined. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie dish. Bake for 8-10 minutes, then let it cool completely.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth. Add the powdered sugar and continue to beat until fully incorporated. Next, add the peanut butter and vanilla extract, mixing until the filling is creamy and uniform. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture until no streaks remain.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble the Pie</h3>
<p>Pour the peanut butter filling into the cooled crust, spreading it evenly with a spatula. If desired, drizzle chocolate sauce over the top for an extra touch of indulgence. Refrigerate the pie for at least 4 hours, or until it’s fully set. For best results, let it chill overnight.</p>

<h3>4. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once the pie is set, slice it into portions and serve chilled. You can garnish with additional whipped cream, chocolate shavings, or a sprinkle of crushed peanuts for added texture and flavor.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Pie</h2>

    <h3>1. Can I use almond butter instead of peanut butter?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute almond butter for peanut butter if you prefer or have a peanut allergy. The flavor will be slightly different, but the texture and consistency will remain similar.</p>

    <h3>2. How long does gluten-free peanut butter pie last in the fridge?</h3>
    <p>When stored in an airtight container, gluten-free peanut butter pie can last up to 5 days in the refrigerator. Be sure to cover it well to prevent it from absorbing other odors.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make this pie dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! To make a dairy-free version, use dairy-free cream cheese, coconut cream instead of heavy cream, and a plant-based butter substitute for the crust.</p>

    <h3>4. Is this pie suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>With a few modifications, yes. Use vegan cream cheese, coconut cream, and a plant-based butter substitute. Ensure all other ingredients, like the chocolate sauce, are vegan-friendly.</p>
