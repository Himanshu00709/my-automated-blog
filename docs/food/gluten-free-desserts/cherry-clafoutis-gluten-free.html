    <h1>Cherry Clafoutis: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>Cherry Clafoutis is a classic French dessert that combines the sweetness of cherries with a custard-like batter. Traditionally, this dish is made with wheat flour, but for those who follow a gluten-free diet, it can be easily adapted without sacrificing flavor or texture. In this article, we’ll explore how to make a delicious gluten-free Cherry Clafoutis, discuss its origins, and provide tips for perfecting this dessert.</p>

    <h2>What is Cherry Clafoutis?</h2>
    <p>Cherry Clafoutis (pronounced kla-foo-TEE) is a rustic French dessert that originated in the Limousin region of France. It is made by baking fresh cherries in a thick, pancake-like batter. The result is a dessert that is both light and rich, with a slightly custardy texture. Traditionally, the cherries are left unpitted, as the pits are believed to add a subtle almond flavor to the dish. However, many modern recipes call for pitted cherries for convenience.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular due to the rise in gluten intolerance and celiac disease. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and other health problems for those with sensitivities. Fortunately, gluten-free alternatives like almond flour, rice flour, and tapioca flour can be used to create a delicious Cherry Clafoutis that everyone can enjoy.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9-inch pie dish or baking pan with butter or coconut oil.</li>
        <li>Spread the pitted cherries evenly across the bottom of the prepared dish.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the almond flour, tapioca flour, sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk and vanilla extract. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, whisking until the batter is smooth and free of lumps.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter over the cherries in the baking dish, ensuring that the cherries are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the clafoutis is set and the top is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving. Dust with powdered sugar if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cherry Clafoutis</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Cherries:</strong> Fresh cherries provide the best flavor and texture. If fresh cherries are not available, you can use frozen cherries, but make sure to thaw and drain them well before using.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flours:</strong> Almond flour and tapioca flour work well in this recipe, but you can also try other gluten-free flours like rice flour or oat flour. Just keep in mind that the texture may vary slightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense clafoutis. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Warm:</strong> Cherry Clafoutis is best served warm, straight from the oven. It can also be enjoyed at room temperature, but avoid refrigerating it, as this can alter the texture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use other fruits instead of cherries?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other fruits like blueberries, raspberries, or peaches. Just make sure to adjust the sugar quantity based on the sweetness of the fruit.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the milk with almond milk or another dairy-free alternative, and use coconut oil instead of butter.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover Cherry Clafoutis?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. Reheat in the oven before serving to restore the texture.</p>

        <h3>Is Cherry Clafoutis suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe contains eggs, so it is not vegan. However, you can experiment with egg substitutes like flax eggs or chia eggs to make a vegan version.</p>
