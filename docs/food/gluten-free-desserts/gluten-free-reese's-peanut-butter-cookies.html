    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free Reese's Peanut Butter Cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Reese's Peanut Butter Cookies</h2>
    <p>While these cookies are a treat, they also offer some nutritional benefits, especially when made with high-quality ingredients. Peanut butter is a good source of protein and healthy fats, which can help keep you full and satisfied. Additionally, using gluten-free flour can make these cookies easier to digest for those with gluten sensitivities. However, it's important to enjoy these cookies in moderation, as they do contain sugar and calories.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Reese's Peanut Butter Cookies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need to avoid gluten. However, the recipe is specifically designed to be gluten-free, so using regular flour will change the texture and nutritional profile of the cookies.</p>

        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cookies for up to 3 months. Simply thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these cookies dairy-free by using a dairy-free butter substitute and ensuring that the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups you use are also dairy-free. Some brands offer dairy-free versions of peanut butter cups.</p>
