<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper. This will ensure that your cake comes out easily after baking.</p>

<h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

<h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

<h3>4. Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Add the lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</p>

<h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

<h3>6. Fold in Blueberries</h3>
<p>Gently fold in the fresh blueberries using a spatula. This will ensure that the blueberries are evenly distributed throughout the batter without being crushed.</p>

<h3>7. Bake the Cake</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>8. Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can dust the cake with powdered sugar or top it with a lemon glaze for added flavor.</p>
