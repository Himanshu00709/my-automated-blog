<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p><strong>Step 1: Prepare the Shortbread Base</strong></p>
<p>Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C fan) and line a 20cm square baking tin with parchment paper. In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, cold butter, and caster sugar. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Press the mixture firmly into the prepared tin, ensuring it is evenly distributed. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the shortbread is golden brown. Allow it to cool completely.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Make the Caramel Filling</strong></p>
<p>In a saucepan, combine the condensed milk, golden syrup, and butter. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring continuously until the butter has melted and the mixture is smooth. Increase the heat slightly and bring the mixture to a gentle boil, stirring constantly. Cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the caramel has thickened and turned a golden color. Pour the caramel over the cooled shortbread base and spread it evenly. Allow the caramel to set for at least 1 hour.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Add the Chocolate Topping</strong></p>
<p>Break the dark chocolate into pieces and melt it in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, ensuring the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Once the chocolate has melted, pour it over the set caramel layer and spread it evenly. If desired, sprinkle a pinch of sea salt over the chocolate for a gourmet touch. Allow the chocolate to set completely before cutting the shortbread into squares.</p>
