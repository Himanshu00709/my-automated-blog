<h1>Gluten-Free Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Bars: A Perfect Fall Treat</h1>

<p>As the leaves change color and the air turns crisp, there's nothing quite like the comforting aroma of pumpkin and chocolate wafting through your kitchen. Gluten-free pumpkin chocolate chip bars are the perfect treat to celebrate the season. These bars are not only delicious but also cater to those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. In this blog post, we'll dive into the recipe, nutritional benefits, and some frequently asked questions about this delightful dessert.</p>

<h2>Why Gluten-Free Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Bars?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free baking has gained immense popularity over the years, and for good reason. Many people suffer from gluten intolerance or celiac disease, which makes it essential to find alternatives to traditional wheat-based recipes. Pumpkin is a fantastic ingredient for gluten-free baking because it adds moisture and a rich, earthy flavor. When combined with chocolate chips, it creates a dessert that is both indulgent and wholesome.</p>

<p>Moreover, pumpkin is packed with nutrients. It's rich in vitamins A and C, which are essential for maintaining healthy skin and boosting the immune system. Pumpkin also contains fiber, which aids in digestion. By incorporating pumpkin into your gluten-free bars, you're not just satisfying your sweet tooth but also nourishing your body.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the recipe:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking pan and line it with parchment paper, leaving some overhang on the sides for easy removal.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and vanilla extract until well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. Fold in the chocolate chips.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the bars to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then use the parchment paper to lift them out of the pan. Let them cool completely on a wire rack before cutting into squares.</p>
