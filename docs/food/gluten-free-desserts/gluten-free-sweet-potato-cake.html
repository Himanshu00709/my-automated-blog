    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making this delightful gluten-free sweet potato cake:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sweet Potatoes:</strong> If you haven't already, cook and mash the sweet potatoes until smooth. Ensure there are no lumps for a consistent texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, melted coconut oil, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and almond milk. Add the mashed sweet potatoes and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Cake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve as is or with a dollop of whipped cream or a drizzle of maple syrup.</li>
