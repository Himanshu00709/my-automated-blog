    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Rice Pudding</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free rice pudding is simple and requires only a few basic ingredients. Below is a step-by-step guide to creating this delicious dessert:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of gluten-free rice (e.g., Arborio, jasmine, or basmati)</li>
        <li>4 cups of milk (dairy or non-dairy)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>Optional: raisins, nuts, or fruit for topping</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and prevents the pudding from becoming too sticky.</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the rinsed rice and milk. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for about 25-30 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the mixture has thickened. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, stir in the sugar, vanilla extract, and ground cinnamon. Continue to cook for an additional 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the pudding cool slightly before serving. You can serve it warm or chilled, depending on your preference.</li>
        <li>If desired, top with raisins, nuts, or fresh fruit before serving.</li>
    </ol>
