    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free mini pumpkin pies is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create your own delicious treats:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> Start by preparing the gluten-free pie crust according to the package instructions. Roll out the dough and cut it into small circles that will fit into your mini pie tins.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Filling:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs, heavy cream, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Pies:</strong> Place the pie crust circles into the mini pie tins. Fill each crust with the pumpkin filling, leaving a little space at the top.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the mini pies in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the pies to cool completely before serving. Enjoy them as is or with a dollop of whipped cream on top.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Mini Pumpkin Pies</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free mini pumpkin pies turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Pie Crust:</strong> Not all gluten-free pie crusts are created equal. Choose a high-quality mix or make your own from scratch for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overfill the Crusts:</strong> Be careful not to overfill the pie crusts with the pumpkin filling. Leave a little space at the top to prevent overflow during baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> To check if the pies are done, insert a toothpick into the center of one. If it comes out clean, the pies are ready.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Store any leftover pies in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>
