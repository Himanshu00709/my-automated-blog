<h1>Gluten-Free Bakewell Slice: A Delicious Treat for Everyone</h1>

<p>The Bakewell slice is a classic British dessert that combines the rich flavors of almond, raspberry, and buttery pastry. Traditionally, this treat is made with wheat flour, but with the rise of gluten-free diets, many people are looking for alternatives that cater to their dietary needs without compromising on taste. Enter the gluten-free Bakewell slice—a delightful adaptation that retains all the charm of the original while being accessible to those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. In this article, we’ll explore the history of the Bakewell slice, how to make a gluten-free version, and answer some frequently asked questions about this delicious dessert.</p>

<h2>The History of the Bakewell Slice</h2>

<p>The Bakewell slice, also known as the Bakewell tart, originates from the town of Bakewell in Derbyshire, England.

The result was so delicious that it became a local specialty and eventually a beloved treat across the UK. Today, the Bakewell slice is enjoyed in many forms, from traditional tarts to modern adaptations like the gluten-free version we’re discussing here.</p>

Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and other health problems for some people. By using gluten-free ingredients, you can enjoy the same delicious flavors of a Bakewell slice without the adverse effects of gluten.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Pastry:</strong> In a large bowl, mix the gluten-free flour and caster sugar. Add the cold butter and rub it into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the egg yolk and mix until a dough forms. Wrap the dough in cling film and chill for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C fan) or 350°F.</li>
    <li><strong>Roll Out the Pastry:</strong> Roll out the chilled dough on a floured surface and line a greased baking tin. Prick the base with a fork and blind bake for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the Jam:</strong> Spread the raspberry jam evenly over the baked pastry base.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the Frangipane:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and caster sugar. Add the eggs one at a time, followed by the almond extract. Fold in the ground almonds.</li>
    <li><strong>Assemble and Bake:</strong> Pour the frangipane mixture over the jam layer and sprinkle with flaked almonds. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the Bakewell slice to cool completely before cutting into squares and serving.</li>
