<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<p>Now that we have all the ingredients ready, let's move on to the step-by-step recipe for making this delicious gluten-free apple and almond cake:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper to prevent the cake from sticking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of the baking powder and salt.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract until well combined. The mixture should be smooth and slightly frothy.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Add Apples</h3>
<p>Fold in the diced apples into the batter, ensuring they are evenly distributed. The apples will add moisture and natural sweetness to the cake.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Pour Batter into Pan</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Sprinkle the almond slices on top for added crunch and flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Bake</h3>
<p>Bake the cake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The top should be golden brown and slightly firm to the touch.</p>

<h3>Step 8: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and serve. Enjoy your gluten-free apple and almond cake!</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

<p>This gluten-free apple and almond cake is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Almond flour is rich in healthy fats, protein, and fiber, making it a great alternative to traditional wheat flour. Apples are a good source of vitamins, particularly vitamin C, and dietary fiber. The use of honey or maple syrup as a sweetener adds natural sweetness without the need for refined sugars. Overall, this cake is a healthier option that doesn't compromise on taste.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use other types of flour instead of almond flour?</h3>
    <p>While almond flour is the primary ingredient in this recipe, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours such as coconut flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I make this cake vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make this cake vegan by substituting the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and using a plant-based sweetener like agave syrup.</p>

    <h3>3. How should I store the cake?</h3>
    <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I add other fruits to the cake?</h3>
