    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (163°C). In a medium-sized bowl, combine the gluten-free graham cracker crumbs or almond flour with the melted butter. Mix until the crumbs are evenly coated. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, ensuring an even layer. Bake the crust for about 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Cheesecake Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until it’s smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar, sour cream, and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, beating just until each egg is incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cheesecake. Pour the filling over the cooled crust and smooth the top with a spatula.</p>

    <h3>3. Baking the Cheesecake</h3>
    <p>Place the springform pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 50-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door slightly open for about an hour. This gradual cooling process helps prevent cracks from forming on the surface of the cheesecake.</p>

    <h3>4. Preparing the Blueberry Topping</h3>
    <p>While the cheesecake is cooling, prepare the blueberry topping. In a small saucepan, combine the fresh blueberries, lemon juice, and cornstarch. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the blueberries release their juices and the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly before spreading it over the cooled cheesecake.</p>

    <h3>5. Chilling and Serving</h3>
    <p>Once the cheesecake has cooled completely, cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. This allows the flavors to meld and the cheesecake to set properly. When you’re ready to serve, remove the cheesecake from the springform pan, slice, and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Blueberry Cheesecake</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use room temperature ingredients:</strong> This ensures a smooth and creamy filling without lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can incorporate too much air, leading to cracks in the cheesecake.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool the cheesecake gradually:</strong> Allowing the cheesecake to cool in the oven with the door slightly open helps prevent cracks.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill thoroughly:</strong> A well-chilled cheesecake is easier to slice and has a better texture.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries if fresh ones are not available. Just be sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in the topping.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cheesecake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the cream cheese and sour cream with dairy-free alternatives. Look for vegan cream cheese and sour cream at your local grocery store.</p>

        <h3>How long does this cheesecake last in the fridge?</h3>
        <p>This cheesecake can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Be sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container to keep it fresh.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the cheesecake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cheesecake for up to 2 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>
