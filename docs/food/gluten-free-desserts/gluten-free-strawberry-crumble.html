<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make this delightful gluten-free strawberry crumble.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This will ensure that your crumble bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown topping.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Strawberries</h3>
<p>Wash and slice the strawberries, then place them in a mixing bowl. If you prefer a sweeter dessert, you can add a tablespoon of maple syrup to the strawberries and toss them gently to coat. This step is optional, as the natural sweetness of the strawberries is usually sufficient.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Make the Crumble Topping</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free oats, almond flour, solid coconut oil, maple syrup, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt. Use your fingers or a fork to mix the ingredients until they form a crumbly texture. The coconut oil should be evenly distributed, creating small clumps that will crisp up beautifully in the oven.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Assemble the Crumble</h3>
<p>Transfer the sliced strawberries to a baking dish, spreading them out evenly. Sprinkle the crumble topping over the strawberries, covering them completely. Make sure to distribute the topping evenly to ensure every bite has the perfect balance of fruit and crunch.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the strawberries are bubbling. The aroma of baked strawberries and cinnamon will fill your kitchen, making it hard to wait until it's done!</p>

<h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once the crumble is out of the oven, let it cool for a few minutes before serving. You can enjoy it as is, or pair it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra indulgent treat. The warm, gooey strawberries combined with the crunchy topping make for a dessert that's hard to resist.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Strawberry Crumble</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use frozen strawberries instead of fresh ones?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries if fresh ones are not available. However, make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in the crumble.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I substitute almond flour with another gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! If you have a nut allergy or prefer a different flour, you can use coconut flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Keep in mind that the texture may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>3. How should I store leftover crumble?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover crumble in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat it in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, this recipe is already vegan-friendly as it uses coconut oil instead of butter. Just make sure to use a vegan-friendly sweetener like maple syrup.</p>

    <h3>5. Can I add other fruits to the crumble?</h3>
