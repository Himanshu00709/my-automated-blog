    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Fruit Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced peaches, blueberries, ¼ cup of granulated sugar, and lemon juice. Toss the fruit gently to coat it evenly. The lemon juice not only enhances the flavor but also helps to balance the sweetness of the fruit. Let the mixture sit while you prepare the biscuit topping.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Biscuit Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, salt, and the remaining ½ cup of sugar. Add the cold, cubed butter to the dry ingredients. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the milk and vanilla extract, stirring until a soft dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the topping dense.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Cobbler</h3>
    <p>Transfer the fruit mixture to a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Drop spoonfuls of the biscuit dough evenly over the fruit. Don't worry about covering every inch; the dough will spread as it bakes. For an extra touch, sprinkle a little sugar on top of the dough to create a golden, slightly crunchy crust.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit filling is bubbling. The aroma of peaches and blueberries will fill your kitchen, signaling that your cobbler is ready. Allow it to cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free blueberry peach cobbler is delicious on its own, but you can elevate it with a few serving suggestions. A scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream adds a creamy contrast to the warm, fruity cobbler. For a dairy-free option, try coconut whipped cream. You can also serve it with a drizzle of honey or a sprinkle of cinnamon for added flavor.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen fruit instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen peaches and blueberries if fresh ones are not available. However, make sure to thaw and drain them well to avoid excess liquid in the filling.</p>

        <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best?</h3>
        <p>Any high-quality gluten-free flour blend that contains xanthan gum will work well. Popular brands include Bob's Red Mill and King Arthur Flour.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cobbler ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the cobbler up to a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. Bake it just before serving for the best texture.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>To make this recipe vegan, substitute the butter with a plant-based alternative and use a dairy-free milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>
