    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined—avoid overmixing to prevent a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>6. Fold in the Apples</h3>
    <p>Peel, core, and dice the apples into small pieces. Gently fold them into the batter, ensuring they’re evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>8. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature, optionally with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Apples:</strong> Tart apples like Granny Smith or Honeycrisp work best, as they hold their shape and provide a nice contrast to the sweet cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until just combined for a light and tender crumb.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking the cake at the 35-minute mark to avoid overbaking.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like almond flour or oat flour. However, the texture and flavor may vary, so adjust the recipe accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and use a non-dairy milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or refrigerate for up to 5 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>
