    <h1>Gluten-Free Alfajores de Maicena: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Alfajores de Maicena are a beloved traditional dessert in many Latin American countries, particularly in Argentina, Uruguay, and Peru. These delicate, melt-in-your-mouth cookies are typically made with cornstarch (maicena), giving them a unique texture that is both crumbly and tender. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, alfajores de maicena are a perfect treat, as they are naturally free from gluten when made with the right ingredients. In this article, we will explore the history of alfajores, the benefits of a gluten-free version, and provide a detailed recipe for you to try at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Alfajores</h2>

    <p>The origins of alfajores can be traced back to the Middle East, where they were introduced to Spain during the Moorish occupation. From Spain, the recipe made its way to Latin America during the colonial period. Over time, the recipe evolved, and each country developed its own unique version. In Argentina, alfajores de maicena became particularly popular, and today they are a staple in bakeries and households across the country.</p>

    <p>Traditionally, alfajores are made with a combination of flour, cornstarch, butter, sugar, and eggs. The cookies are then sandwiched together with dulce de leche, a rich and creamy caramel-like spread, and often dusted with powdered sugar or coated in chocolate. The result is a sweet, indulgent treat that is enjoyed by people of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of health issues, including digestive problems, fatigue, and nutrient deficiencies. Even for those without gluten-related disorders, reducing gluten intake can sometimes lead to improved digestion and overall well-being.</p>

    <p>By making alfajores de maicena gluten-free, you can enjoy this classic dessert without worrying about the potential negative effects of gluten. The key to achieving the perfect gluten-free alfajor lies in the use of high-quality cornstarch and ensuring that all other ingredients are free from gluten contamination.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the cornstarch, gluten-free flour blend, and baking powder.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the egg yolks and vanilla:</strong> Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the cookies:</strong> Roll the dough into small balls (about 1 inch in diameter) and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Flatten each ball slightly with the palm of your hand.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake, as the cookies should remain tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the alfajores:</strong> Once cooled, spread a generous amount of dulce de leche on the flat side of one cookie and sandwich it with another cookie. Repeat with the remaining cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Dust with powdered sugar:</strong> Lightly dust the assembled alfajores with powdered sugar before serving.</li>
    </ol>
