    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the process of making a gluten-free fruit crisp:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Fruit Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Wash and chop your chosen fruit into bite-sized pieces. If you’re using berries, you can leave them whole. Place the fruit in a large mixing bowl and toss it with a tablespoon of coconut sugar or maple syrup, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and a splash of vanilla extract. This will help enhance the natural sweetness of the fruit. Transfer the fruit mixture to a baking dish and spread it out evenly.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Crisp Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free oats, almond flour, remaining coconut sugar or maple syrup, and a pinch of salt. Mix well to ensure all the ingredients are evenly distributed. Add the butter or coconut oil and use your fingers or a pastry cutter to work it into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. This will create the perfect crunchy topping for your fruit crisp.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Sprinkle the crisp topping evenly over the fruit in the baking dish. Make sure to cover the fruit completely for the best texture. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free fruit crisp is incredibly versatile and can be served in a variety of ways. Here are a few ideas to get you started:</p>

        <li><strong>With Ice Cream:</strong> A scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of warm fruit crisp is a classic combination that never disappoints.</li>
        <li><strong>With Whipped Cream:</strong> For a lighter option, try topping your crisp with a dollop of whipped cream or coconut whipped cream.</li>
        <li><strong>With Yogurt:</strong> For a healthier twist, serve your fruit crisp with a side of Greek yogurt or a dairy-free alternative.</li>
        <li><strong>As a Breakfast Treat:</strong> Leftover fruit crisp can be enjoyed as a sweet and satisfying breakfast option. Pair it with a cup of coffee or tea for a delightful start to your day.</li>
