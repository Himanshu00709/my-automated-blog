    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free dirt cups is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create your own:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pudding</h3>
    <p>Start by preparing the chocolate pudding according to the instructions on the box. If you’re using a dairy-free milk alternative, ensure it’s well-mixed and smooth. Allow the pudding to set in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Crush the Cookies</h3>
    <p>While the pudding is setting, crush the gluten-free chocolate cookies into small, dirt-like pieces. You can use a food processor or place the cookies in a zip-top bag and crush them with a rolling pin.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Dirt Cups</h3>
    <p>Once the pudding has set, it’s time to assemble the dirt cups. Start by layering a spoonful of crushed cookies at the bottom of each cup. Next, add a layer of chocolate pudding, followed by another layer of crushed cookies. Repeat the layers until the cup is nearly full.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Gummy Worms</h3>
    <p>To give your dirt cups a playful touch, add a few gummy worms on top. You can partially bury them in the crushed cookies to make it look like they’re crawling through the dirt.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Optional Toppings</h3>
    <p>For an extra touch of indulgence, top your dirt cups with a dollop of whipped cream. You can also sprinkle a few extra cookie crumbs on top for added texture.</p>

    <h2>Customization Tips</h2>

    <p>One of the best things about gluten-free dirt cups is how customizable they are. Here are a few ideas to make your dirt cups unique:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Different Flavors:</strong> Swap out the chocolate pudding for vanilla, butterscotch, or even banana pudding for a different flavor profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Fresh Fruit:</strong> Incorporate fresh berries or sliced bananas between the layers for a fruity twist.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> Try using crushed gluten-free graham crackers, nuts, or even coconut flakes as a topping.</li>
        <li><strong>Make It Vegan:</strong> Use dairy-free pudding and whipped cream to create a vegan-friendly version.</li>
    </ul>
