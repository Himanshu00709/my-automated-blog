    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free s'mores bars:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a medium-sized bowl, combine the crushed gluten-free graham crackers, melted butter, and granulated sugar. Mix until the ingredients are well combined and the mixture resembles wet sand. Press this mixture firmly into the bottom of a greased 9x9 inch baking pan to form the crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Chocolate Layer</h3>

    <p>Once the crust is prepared, sprinkle the chocolate chips evenly over the top. You can use any type of chocolate chips you prefer, but dark chocolate adds a rich, decadent flavor that pairs beautifully with the marshmallows.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Top with Marshmallows</h3>

    <p>Next, layer the marshmallows on top of the chocolate chips. If you're using regular-sized marshmallows, you may want to cut them in half to ensure even coverage. Mini marshmallows work perfectly as they are and provide a nice, even layer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake to Perfection</h3>

    <p>Place the baking pan in the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the marshmallows are golden brown and slightly puffed. Keep an eye on the bars as they bake to prevent the marshmallows from burning.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>

    <p>Once the bars are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely in the pan. This will allow the chocolate to set and the bars to firm up. Once cooled, cut into squares and serve. Enjoy your gluten-free s'mores bars!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free S'mores Bars</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these bars dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make these bars dairy-free by substituting the butter with coconut oil and using dairy-free chocolate chips. Ensure that the marshmallows you use are also dairy-free, as some brands may contain dairy derivatives.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free s'mores bars?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free s'mores bars can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate them for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months. If freezing, wrap the bars individually in plastic wrap before placing them in a freezer-safe container.</p>

        <h3>Can I use homemade marshmallows?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Homemade marshmallows can be a great addition to your gluten-free s'mores bars. Just ensure that any ingredients used in the marshmallows are also gluten-free to maintain the integrity of the recipe.</p>

        <h3>Are there any nut-free options for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>This recipe is naturally nut-free, but always check the labels of your ingredients to ensure they haven't been processed in a facility that handles nuts if you have a severe allergy.</p>
