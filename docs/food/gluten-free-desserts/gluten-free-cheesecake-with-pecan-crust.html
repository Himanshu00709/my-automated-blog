    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Pecan Crust</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a food processor, pulse the pecans until they are finely ground. Be careful not to over-process, as you don’t want to turn them into pecan butter. In a mixing bowl, combine the ground pecans, melted butter, and 1/4 cup of granulated sugar. Mix until the ingredients are well combined and the mixture resembles wet sand. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, ensuring an even layer. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Cheesecake Filling</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until it is smooth and creamy. Add the sour cream, 1 cup of granulated sugar, vanilla extract, and lemon juice, and continue to beat until the mixture is well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Be careful not to overmix, as this can incorporate too much air into the batter, leading to cracks in the cheesecake. Pour the filling over the cooled pecan crust, spreading it evenly with a spatula.</p>

    <h3>3. Baking the Cheesecake</h3>

    <p>Place the springform pan in the preheated oven and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle. Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside with the door slightly ajar for about an hour. This gradual cooling process helps prevent cracks from forming on the surface of the cheesecake. After an hour, remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature. Once cooled, refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow it to set completely.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>

    <p>When you’re ready to serve, carefully remove the cheesecake from the springform pan. You can garnish it with fresh berries, a drizzle of caramel sauce, or a dusting of powdered sugar for an extra touch of elegance. Slice the cheesecake with a sharp knife, wiping the blade clean between cuts to ensure neat slices. Serve chilled and enjoy the rich, creamy texture paired with the crunchy, nutty crust.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of nut for the crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute pecans with other nuts like almonds, walnuts, or hazelnuts. Each nut will impart a slightly different flavor, so feel free to experiment based on your preferences.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover cheesecake?</h3>
        <p>Leftover cheesecake should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will keep well for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cheesecake for up to 2 months. To freeze, wrap individual slices in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe container.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cheesecake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a dairy-free version by using dairy-free cream cheese and sour cream alternatives. Be sure to check the labels to ensure they are gluten-free as well.</p>

        <h3>Why did my cheesecake crack?</h3>
        <p>Cracks in cheesecake are often caused by overmixing the batter, baking at too high a temperature, or cooling the cheesecake too quickly. To prevent cracks, avoid overmixing, bake at the recommended temperature, and allow the cheesecake to cool gradually in the oven.</p>
