    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Crust</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, tapioca flour, and a pinch of salt. Add the melted coconut oil and maple syrup, and mix until the dough comes together. Press the dough evenly into a tart pan, making sure to cover the bottom and sides. Bake the crust for about 10-12 minutes, or until it turns golden brown. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Blueberry Filling</h3>

    <p>While the crust is cooling, prepare the blueberry filling. In a medium saucepan, combine the fresh blueberries, lemon juice, and maple syrup. Cook over medium heat until the blueberries start to release their juices. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with a little water to create a slurry, then add it to the blueberry mixture. Stir continuously until the filling thickens. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Let the filling cool slightly before pouring it into the prepared crust.</p>

    <h3>3. Assembling and Serving</h3>

    <p>Once the crust and filling have cooled, carefully pour the blueberry filling into the crust. Spread it evenly with a spatula. You can garnish the tart with additional fresh blueberries or a sprinkle of powdered sugar if desired. Allow the tart to set in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving. Slice and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in the filling.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute almond flour with another gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can use other gluten-free flours like oat flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>How long does the tart last in the refrigerator?</h3>
        <p>The gluten-free blueberry tart can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container to maintain freshness.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this recipe is vegan-friendly as it uses coconut oil and maple syrup instead of dairy and refined sugars. Just ensure that all other ingredients used are also vegan.</p>
