    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Rinse the Rice:</strong> Start by rinsing the gluten-free rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and prevents the pudding from becoming too sticky.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Rice:</strong> In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the rinsed rice and 2 cups of milk. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer, stirring occasionally, until the rice is tender and most of the milk has been absorbed (about 20-25 minutes).</li>
        <li><strong>Add Sweeteners and Flavorings:</strong> Stir in the sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon (if using). Continue to cook the mixture, adding the remaining 2 cups of milk gradually, until the pudding reaches your desired consistency. This should take about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate Optional Ingredients:</strong> If you’re using raisins or other dried fruits, add them during the last few minutes of cooking to allow them to plump up.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Once the pudding has thickened to your liking, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly. Serve warm or chilled, garnished with a sprinkle of cinnamon or a dollop of whipped cream if desired.</li>
    </ol>
