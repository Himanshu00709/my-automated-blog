Whether you're hosting a fall gathering or simply looking for a cozy treat to enjoy with a cup of tea, these whoopie pies are sure to impress.</p>

    <h2>What Are Whoopie Pies?</h2>

    <p>Whoopie pies are a classic American dessert that originated in the New England region. They consist of two soft, cake-like cookies sandwiched together with a creamy filling.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free pumpkin whoopie pies is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create your own batch of fall-inspired treats:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cookie Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and spices. In a separate bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs, melted butter or coconut oil, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the cookies are set and lightly golden around the edges. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the cookies are cooling, prepare the filling. You can use store-bought marshmallow fluff or make your own cream cheese filling by beating together cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Whoopie Pies</h3>
    <p>Once the cookies are completely cool, spread a generous amount of filling on the flat side of one cookie and sandwich it with another cookie. Repeat with the remaining cookies and filling. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</p>
