<h1>Gluten-Free Rhubarb Pie: A Delicious and Healthy Dessert</h1>

<p>Rhubarb pie is a classic dessert that has been enjoyed for generations. Its tangy flavor and sweet filling make it a favorite among pie lovers.

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Pie Crust</h3>

<p>Start by making the gluten-free pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Divide the dough into two equal portions, shape them into discs, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Rhubarb Filling</h3>

<p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the rhubarb filling. In a large bowl, combine the chopped rhubarb, granulated sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Mix well to ensure that the rhubarb is evenly coated. Set aside to allow the flavors to meld while you roll out the dough.</p>

<h3>3. Roll Out the Dough</h3>

<p>Once the dough has chilled, remove one disc from the refrigerator and roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Roll the dough into a circle large enough to fit your pie dish. Carefully transfer the dough to the pie dish, pressing it gently into the bottom and sides. Trim any excess dough from the edges.</p>

<h3>4. Assemble the Pie</h3>

<p>Pour the prepared rhubarb filling into the pie crust. Roll out the second disc of dough and place it over the filling. You can create a lattice top or simply cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape. Seal the edges by crimping them with a fork or your fingers.</p>

<h3>5. Bake the Pie</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the pie on the middle rack and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. If the edges of the crust begin to brown too quickly, cover them with aluminum foil to prevent burning.</p>

<h3>6. Cool and Serve</h3>

<p>Once the pie is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours. This allows the filling to set properly. Serve the pie warm or at room temperature, optionally with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Rhubarb Pie</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use frozen rhubarb for this recipe?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen rhubarb, but make sure to thaw and drain it thoroughly before using. Excess moisture can affect the texture of the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. What gluten-free flour blend works best for pie crust?</h3>
    <p>A blend that includes xanthan gum, such as Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free 1-to-1 Baking Flour, works well for pie crusts. Xanthan gum helps mimic the elasticity of gluten, resulting in a flakier crust.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make this pie ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the pie up to a day in advance. Store it in the refrigerator and reheat it in the oven before serving to restore the crust's crispiness.</p>

    <h3>4. How do I store leftover gluten-free rhubarb pie?</h3>
    <p>Store leftover pie in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze the pie for up to 2 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator before reheating.</p>
