<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk, vanilla extract, and melted butter. Mix until well combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li><strong>Poke Holes:</strong> Once the cake is out of the oven, use the handle of a wooden spoon to poke holes all over the cake.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Filling:</strong> Prepare the Jello or pudding mix according to the package instructions, then pour it over the cake, making sure it seeps into the holes.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill:</strong> Refrigerate the cake for at least 2 hours to allow the filling to set.</li>
    <li><strong>Top and Serve:</strong> Before serving, spread whipped topping over the cake if desired. Slice and enjoy!</li>

<h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Poke Cake</h2>

<p>Creating the perfect gluten-free poke cake requires a bit of attention to detail. Here are some tips to ensure your cake turns out moist, flavorful, and perfectly textured:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flour blends are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as these often contain a mix of flours and starches that mimic the properties of wheat flour.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense, tough cake. Mix until just combined to keep the cake light and fluffy.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Using room temperature eggs and milk helps the ingredients blend more easily, resulting in a smoother batter.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill Thoroughly:</strong> Allowing the cake to chill in the refrigerator ensures that the filling sets properly and the flavors meld together.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Don’t be afraid to get creative with your flavors. Try different Jello or pudding flavors, or even add fresh fruit or chocolate chips to the batter for an extra twist.</li>
</ul>
