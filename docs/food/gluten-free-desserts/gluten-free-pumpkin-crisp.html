    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free pumpkin crisp is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a dessert that will impress your family and friends:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your crisp bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown topping.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Pumpkin Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Mix until well combined. This will be the base of your crisp, so make sure the flavors are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Crisp Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free flour blend, rolled oats, brown sugar, and melted butter. Stir until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. This will create the crunchy topping that makes the crisp so irresistible.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Spread the pumpkin mixture evenly in a greased baking dish. Sprinkle the crisp topping over the pumpkin layer, making sure to cover it completely. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the crisp to cool slightly before serving. It pairs wonderfully with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Enjoy the warm, spiced flavors of fall in every bite!</p>

        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh pumpkin puree if you prefer. Just make sure it's smooth and free of any stringy bits. You'll need about 2 cups of fresh puree to replace the canned version.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover pumpkin crisp in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat it in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
