    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all the necessary ingredients, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free banana pudding:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pudding</h3>
    <p>Start by preparing the gluten-free pudding mix according to the package instructions. Typically, this involves whisking the pudding mix with cold milk until it thickens. Set the pudding aside to cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Layer the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large serving dish or individual dessert cups, begin layering the ingredients. Start with a layer of gluten-free vanilla wafers at the bottom. Next, add a layer of sliced bananas, followed by a layer of the prepared pudding. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of pudding on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Chill the Pudding</h3>
    <p>Cover the pudding with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until it is fully set. This allows the flavors to meld together and the wafers to soften slightly, creating the perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Toppings (Optional)</h3>
    <p>Before serving, you can add a dollop of whipped cream on top of each serving for an extra touch of indulgence. You can also garnish with additional banana slices or gluten-free wafer crumbs for added texture and visual appeal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Banana Pudding</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use homemade gluten-free cookies instead of store-bought wafers?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer to make your own gluten-free cookies, you can use a recipe for gluten-free vanilla cookies or shortbread. Just ensure that they are fully cooled before layering them in the pudding.</p>

        <h3>Is gluten-free banana pudding suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free banana pudding can easily be made vegan by using a plant-based milk (such as almond, soy, or oat milk) and a vegan-friendly pudding mix. Additionally, you can use a dairy-free whipped cream alternative for the topping.</p>

        <h3>How long does gluten-free banana pudding last in the refrigerator?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free banana pudding can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. However, it is best enjoyed within the first 24-48 hours to ensure the bananas remain fresh and the pudding maintains its texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free banana pudding?</h3>
        <p>While it is possible to freeze gluten-free banana pudding, the texture may change upon thawing. The bananas may become mushy, and the pudding may separate slightly. It is generally recommended to enjoy the pudding fresh or refrigerated.</p>
