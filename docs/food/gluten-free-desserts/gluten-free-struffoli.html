    <h1>Gluten-Free Struffoli: A Delicious Twist on a Classic Italian Dessert</h1>

    <p>Struffoli, a traditional Italian dessert, is a beloved treat often enjoyed during the holiday season. These small, fried dough balls are typically coated in honey and adorned with colorful sprinkles, creating a festive and irresistible dessert. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying traditional struffoli can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free struffoli—a delightful alternative that allows everyone to savor this classic Italian treat without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>What is Struffoli?</h2>

    <p>Struffoli, also known as "honey balls," is a traditional Italian dessert that originated in Naples. It is made by frying small balls of dough, which are then coated in a sweet honey syrup and often decorated with sprinkles, candied fruit, or nuts. The dessert is typically served during Christmas and Easter, making it a staple of Italian holiday celebrations.</p>

    <p>The name "struffoli" is derived from the Greek word "strongoulos," meaning "round in shape." This perfectly describes the small, round dough balls that are the hallmark of this dessert. Struffoli is not only a treat for the taste buds but also a feast for the eyes, often arranged in a wreath or pyramid shape and garnished to perfection.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular in recent years, not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals with gluten sensitivities or those seeking a healthier lifestyle. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and other health problems for some people. By opting for gluten-free struffoli, you can enjoy this traditional dessert without the adverse effects of gluten.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free baking has come a long way, with a variety of alternative flours and ingredients now available that can replicate the texture and flavor of traditional wheat-based recipes. This means that gluten-free struffoli can be just as delicious and satisfying as the original version.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Struffoli</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free struffoli is a straightforward process, but it does require some patience and attention to detail. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create this delicious dessert:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and xanthan gum. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, softened butter, granulated sugar, vanilla extract, and lemon zest. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Knead the dough gently until it becomes smooth and elastic.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Shape the Dough Balls</h3>

    <p>Divide the dough into small portions and roll each portion into a thin rope, about 1/2 inch in diameter. Cut the ropes into small pieces, approximately 1/2 inch in length. Roll each piece into a small ball, ensuring they are uniform in size for even cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Fry the Dough Balls</h3>

    <p>Heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or pot to 350°F (175°C). Carefully add the dough balls to the hot oil in small batches, frying until they are golden brown and crispy. Use a slotted spoon to remove the fried balls from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Prepare the Honey Syrup</h3>

    <p>In a small saucepan, heat the honey over medium heat until it becomes thin and runny. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Coat the Struffoli</h3>

    <p>Once the dough balls have cooled slightly, transfer them to a large bowl. Pour the warm honey syrup over the balls, gently tossing to ensure they are evenly coated. Allow the struffoli to sit for a few minutes to absorb the honey.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Decorate and Serve</h3>

    <p>Arrange the honey-coated struffoli on a serving platter, shaping them into a wreath or pyramid. Decorate with sprinkles, candied fruit, or nuts as desired. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container for later enjoyment.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Struffoli</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make struffoli ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare gluten-free struffoli ahead of time. Once the struffoli are coated in honey and decorated, they can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. However, for the best texture and flavor, it's recommended to serve them within 24 hours of preparation.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different sweetener instead of honey?</h3>
        <p>While honey is traditional for struffoli, you can experiment with other sweeteners such as maple syrup or agave nectar. Keep in mind that the flavor and texture may vary slightly depending on the sweetener you choose.</p>

        <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best for struffoli?</h3>
        <p>A gluten-free flour blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch works well for struffoli. You can also use a pre-made gluten-free flour blend designed for baking. Be sure to check the blend's instructions, as some may already contain xanthan gum.</p>

        <h3>Can I bake the struffoli instead of frying them?</h3>
        <p>While frying is traditional and gives struffoli their characteristic crispy texture, you can bake them as an alternative. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and bake the dough balls on a parchment-lined baking sheet for about 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown. Keep in mind that baked struffoli may have a slightly different texture compared to the fried version.</p>
