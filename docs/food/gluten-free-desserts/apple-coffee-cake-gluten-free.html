<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get baking! Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free apple coffee cake:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with a little oil or butter, and line the bottom with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, tapioca flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk these ingredients together until well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, honey (or maple syrup), applesauce, and vanilla extract. Make sure the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined, being careful not to overmix. The batter should be thick but pourable.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Add Apples and Cinnamon</h3>
<p>Gently fold in the diced apples and cinnamon into the batter. If you’re using nuts, you can also add them at this stage.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve with a cup of coffee or tea for the perfect treat!</p>
