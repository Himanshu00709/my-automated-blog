    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free microwave brownie is incredibly straightforward. Follow these steps to create your delicious treat:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a microwave-safe mug or small bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Stir until well mixed.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Wet Ingredients:</strong> Pour in the milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Stir until the mixture is smooth and free of lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Chocolate Chips (Optional):</strong> If you want an extra chocolatey brownie, fold in a tablespoon of chocolate chips into the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Microwave:</strong> Place the mug or bowl in the microwave and cook on high for about 1 minute. Keep an eye on it to prevent overcooking. The brownie should be moist but not runny.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the brownie to cool for a minute or two before digging in. You can top it with a scoop of ice cream, a drizzle of chocolate sauce, or simply enjoy it as is.</li>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Microwave Brownies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, almond flour can be used as a substitute for gluten-free flour. However, keep in mind that almond flour has a different texture and may result in a denser brownie. You may need to adjust the quantity slightly to achieve the desired consistency.</p>

        <h3>Can I double the recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can double or even triple the recipe if you're making brownies for more people. Just make sure to use a larger microwave-safe container and adjust the cooking time accordingly.</p>
