    <h1>Gooey Butter Cake: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>Gooey Butter Cake is a classic dessert that has been delighting taste buds for generations. Originating from St. Louis, Missouri, this rich and decadent cake is known for its unique texture—a soft, gooey center paired with a slightly crisp crust. Traditionally made with wheat flour, the rise of gluten-free diets has led to the creation of a gluten-free version that is just as delicious. In this blog post, we’ll explore the history of Gooey Butter Cake, how to make a gluten-free version, and answer some frequently asked questions about this delightful treat.</p>

    <h2>The History of Gooey Butter Cake</h2>
    <p>The origins of Gooey Butter Cake date back to the 1930s in St. Louis. Legend has it that a baker accidentally mixed up the proportions of ingredients while making a regular cake, resulting in a gooey, buttery delight. Instead of discarding the mistake, the baker decided to sell it, and it quickly became a local favorite. Over the years, the recipe has evolved, but the essence of the cake—its gooey, buttery center—has remained the same.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular due to the rise in gluten intolerance and celiac disease. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and other health problems for those with sensitivities. Fortunately, with the availability of gluten-free flours and baking techniques, it’s now possible to enjoy traditional recipes like Gooey Butter Cake without the gluten.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Gooey Butter Cake</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free version of Gooey Butter Cake is easier than you might think. The key is to use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend that mimics the texture of wheat flour. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating this delicious dessert:</p>

    </table>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, 1/2 cup of sugar, and softened butter. Mix until the dough comes together. Press the dough evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Filling:</strong> In another bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the remaining 1 cup of sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, baking powder, and salt. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Cake:</strong> Pour the cream cheese mixture over the crust in the pan, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the center is set but still slightly jiggly.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool completely before dusting with powdered sugar. Cut into squares and serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Gooey Butter Cake</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overbake:</strong> The key to a gooey center is to avoid overbaking. The cake should be set around the edges but still slightly jiggly in the center when you take it out of the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it Cool:</strong> Allow the cake to cool completely before cutting. This will help the filling set and make it easier to slice.</li>
    </ul>
