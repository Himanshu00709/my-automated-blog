    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free Gooey Butter Cake is surprisingly simple. Follow these steps to create a delicious dessert that everyone can enjoy:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.</li>

        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool completely in the pan before dusting with powdered sugar and slicing into squares.</li>
    </ol>
