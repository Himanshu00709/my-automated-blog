However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying this treat can be a challenge. Enter the Gluten-Free Apple Betty—a delicious and healthy alternative that doesn’t compromise on taste or texture. In this blog post, we’ll explore the history of Apple Betty, the benefits of going gluten-free, and provide a step-by-step recipe to create your own gluten-free version at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Apple Betty</h2>
    <p>Apple Betty, also known as Apple Brown Betty, is a traditional American dessert that dates back to colonial times. The dish is believed to have originated in the 19th century and was a popular way to use up stale bread. The name "Betty" is thought to be derived from the Old English word "bett," meaning "to beat," which refers to the process of crushing the bread crumbs for the topping. Over time, the recipe evolved, and today, it is typically made with a mixture of apples, sugar, spices, and a crumbly topping made from flour, butter, and sugar.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity in recent years, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals looking to improve their overall health. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems for some people. By opting for gluten-free alternatives, you can enjoy your favorite foods without the negative side effects. Additionally, gluten-free baking often incorporates nutrient-dense ingredients like almond flour, coconut flour, and oats, which can add extra fiber, protein, and healthy fats to your diet.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Apple Betty Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that we’ve covered the history and benefits of going gluten-free, let’s dive into the recipe for a delicious Gluten-Free Apple Betty. This recipe is easy to follow and uses simple, wholesome ingredients that you can find at your local grocery store.</p>
