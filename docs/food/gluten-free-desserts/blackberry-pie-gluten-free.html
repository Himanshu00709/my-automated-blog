<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Pie Crust</h3>

<p>Start by making the gluten-free pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Divide the dough into two equal portions, shape them into discs, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Blackberry Filling</h3>

<p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the blackberry filling. In a large bowl, combine the fresh blackberries, granulated sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice. Gently toss the ingredients together until the blackberries are evenly coated. Set the mixture aside to allow the flavors to meld.</p>

<h3>3. Roll Out the Dough</h3>

<p>Once the dough has chilled, remove it from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured surface (using gluten-free flour), roll out one disc of dough into a circle large enough to fit your pie dish. Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough to the pie dish, pressing it gently into the bottom and sides. Trim any excess dough hanging over the edges.</p>

<h3>4. Assemble the Pie</h3>

<p>Pour the blackberry filling into the prepared pie crust. Roll out the second disc of dough and place it over the filling. You can create a lattice pattern or simply cover the pie with the dough, cutting a few slits in the top to allow steam to escape. Seal the edges by crimping them with a fork or your fingers.</p>

<h3>5. Bake the Pie</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a small bowl, beat the egg and brush it over the top crust to give the pie a golden finish. Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Allow the pie to cool completely before serving.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen blackberries instead of fresh?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen blackberries if fresh ones are not available. However, make sure to thaw and drain them before using to prevent the pie from becoming too watery.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best for pie crust?</h3>
    <p>A blend of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch is commonly used for gluten-free pie crusts. You can also find pre-made gluten-free flour blends at most grocery stores.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>How do I store leftover gluten-free blackberry pie?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover pie in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze the pie for up to 2 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator before serving.</p>
</div>
