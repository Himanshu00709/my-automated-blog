    <h1>Gluten-Free Butter Tarts: A Delicious Twist on a Classic Treat</h1>

    <p>Butter tarts are a quintessential Canadian dessert, known for their rich, gooey filling and flaky pastry crust. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic treat can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free butter tarts—a delightful alternative that allows everyone to indulge in this beloved dessert. In this article, we’ll explore the history of butter tarts, the benefits of going gluten-free, and provide a step-by-step guide to making your own gluten-free butter tarts at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Butter Tarts</h2>

    <p>Butter tarts have a long and storied history in Canadian cuisine. Believed to have originated in the early 1900s, these sweet pastries quickly became a staple in Canadian households. The traditional recipe consists of a buttery pastry shell filled with a mixture of butter, sugar, syrup, and eggs, often enhanced with raisins or pecans. Over the years, butter tarts have evolved, with various regions adding their own unique twists to the recipe.</p>

    <p>Despite their popularity, traditional butter tarts are off-limits for those who need to avoid gluten. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause serious health issues for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Fortunately, with the rise of gluten-free baking, it’s now possible to enjoy butter tarts without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Pastry:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and cold butter. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to blend the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> On a lightly floured surface (using gluten-free flour), roll out the dough to about ¼ inch thickness. Use a round cutter to cut out circles that will fit into your tart pans or muffin tin.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, corn syrup, egg, and vanilla extract until well combined. If desired, stir in raisins or pecans.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Tarts:</strong> Place the pastry circles into the tart pans or muffin tin. Fill each shell about two-thirds full with the filling mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the filling is set and the pastry is golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the tarts to cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
