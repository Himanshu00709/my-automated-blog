    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create your gluten-free pumpkin cheesecake cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the cheesecake filling:</strong> In a small bowl, mix the cream cheese, 1/4 cup of granulated sugar, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the cookie dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter, remaining granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg, pumpkin puree, and remaining vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the cookies:</strong> Scoop about 1 tablespoon of dough and flatten it slightly in your hand. Place a small dollop of the cheesecake filling in the center, then top with another tablespoon of dough. Seal the edges and roll into a ball. Place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the cookies for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow them to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Cookies</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free pumpkin cheesecake cookies turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky to handle, chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before assembling the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> These cookies are best enjoyed fresh, but they can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the cookies to be gluten-free. However, the texture may be slightly different.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I freeze these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! These cookies freeze well. Place them in an airtight container or freezer bag and store for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of pumpkin puree?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh pumpkin puree. Just make sure it's well-drained and has a similar consistency to canned pumpkin puree.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free pumpkin cheesecake cookies are the perfect treat to celebrate the flavors of fall. With their soft, chewy texture and rich, creamy filling, they're sure to become a favorite in your household. Whether you're baking for a special occasion or just want to enjoy a cozy afternoon with a cup of tea, these cookies are a delightful choice.
