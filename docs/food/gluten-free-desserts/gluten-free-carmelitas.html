<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Carmelitas</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use regular oats instead of gluten-free oats?</h3>
    <p>While regular oats are naturally gluten-free, they are often processed in facilities that also process wheat, which can lead to cross-contamination. To ensure your carmelitas are truly gluten-free, it’s best to use certified gluten-free oats.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these carmelitas dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can easily make these carmelitas dairy-free by using a dairy-free butter alternative and ensuring that your caramel sauce is also dairy-free. Many brands offer dairy-free caramel sauce, or you can make your own at home.</p>

    <h3>How should I store gluten-free carmelitas?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free carmelitas can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate them for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I add nuts or other toppings?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Feel free to customize your gluten-free carmelitas by adding chopped nuts, such as pecans or walnuts, to the oat mixture or sprinkling them on top before baking. You can also experiment with other toppings like shredded coconut or dried fruit.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
