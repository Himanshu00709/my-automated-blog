    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum, and salt. Cut in the cold butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, mixing until the dough comes together. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the sliced apples, sugar, cinnamon, raisins, and nuts (if using). Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a rectangle about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Strudel:</strong> Spread the apple filling evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Carefully roll the dough into a log, sealing the edges.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the strudel on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Allow the strudel to cool slightly before slicing. Serve warm with a dusting of powdered sugar or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.</li>
