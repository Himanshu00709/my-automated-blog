    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by making the gluten-free pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Cranberry Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough chills, prepare the cranberry filling. In a medium saucepan, combine the fresh cranberries, orange zest, maple syrup, and cornstarch. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the cranberries burst and the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>3. Assembling and Baking the Pie</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface and transfer it to a pie dish. Pour the cranberry filling into the crust. If desired, you can create a lattice top with additional dough or simply leave the pie open-faced. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Allow the pie to cool before serving.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Cranberry Pie</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free cranberry pie is not only delicious but also offers several nutritional benefits. Cranberries are a powerhouse of antioxidants, which help combat oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. The gluten-free crust, made with a blend of alternative flours, is easier to digest for those with gluten sensitivities. Additionally, using natural sweeteners like maple syrup reduces the overall sugar content, making this pie a healthier option compared to traditional desserts.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen cranberries instead of fresh ones?</h3>
        <p>Yes, frozen cranberries can be used as a substitute for fresh cranberries. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in the filling.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What can I use instead of maple syrup?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have maple syrup, you can use honey or agave syrup as a natural sweetener. Adjust the quantity to taste.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I store leftover pie?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover pie in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze the pie for up to 2 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before serving.</p>
    </div>
