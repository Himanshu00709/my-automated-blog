    <h1>Gluten-Free Berry Crisp with Oats: A Delicious and Healthy Dessert</h1>

    <p>When it comes to desserts, few things are as comforting and satisfying as a warm berry crisp. The combination of sweet, juicy berries and a crunchy oat topping is simply irresistible. But what if you're following a gluten-free diet? Fear not! This gluten-free berry crisp with oats is here to save the day. Not only is it delicious, but it's also packed with nutrients, making it a guilt-free treat you can enjoy any time of the year.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Berry Crisp?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not just for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also for people looking to improve their overall health. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and inflammation in some individuals. By opting for a gluten-free dessert like this berry crisp, you can enjoy a sweet treat without the worry of gluten-related discomfort.</p>

    <p>Moreover, this recipe uses oats, which are naturally gluten-free (as long as they are certified gluten-free). Oats are a great source of fiber, which aids in digestion and helps keep you feeling full longer. Combined with the antioxidants found in berries, this dessert is not only tasty but also beneficial for your health.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make this delicious gluten-free berry crisp:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your crisp bakes evenly and gets that perfect golden-brown topping.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Berry Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the mixed berries, lemon juice, and 1/4 cup of coconut sugar. Gently toss the berries until they are evenly coated. Transfer the berry mixture to a baking dish and spread it out evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Oat Topping</h3>
    <p>In another bowl, mix together the gluten-free oats, almond flour, remaining 1/4 cup of coconut sugar, and salt. Add the melted butter (or coconut oil) and vanilla extract, and stir until the mixture is crumbly and well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Sprinkle the oat topping evenly over the berry mixture in the baking dish. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the berries are bubbling.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Remove the berry crisp from the oven and let it cool for about 10 minutes before serving. This allows the filling to set slightly, making it easier to serve. Enjoy your gluten-free berry crisp warm, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream if desired.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen berries?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen berries if fresh ones are not available. There's no need to thaw them before using; just add a couple of extra minutes to the baking time.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with coconut oil, and you'll have a delicious vegan berry crisp.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat it in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours like oat flour or a gluten-free all-purpose blend. However, the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>
