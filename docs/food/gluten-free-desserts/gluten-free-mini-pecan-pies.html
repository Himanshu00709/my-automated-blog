    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free mini pecan pies is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create your own delicious mini pies:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preparing the gluten-free crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, granulated sugar, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the pecan pie filling. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, corn syrup, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined. Stir in the chopped pecans. Set the filling aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Mini Pies</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Use a round cookie cutter or the rim of a glass to cut out circles of dough. Press each circle into the cups of a mini muffin tin, making sure to press the dough up the sides. Fill each crust with the pecan filling, being careful not to overfill.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake and Cool</h3>
    <p>Bake the mini pecan pies in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown. Allow the pies to cool in the muffin tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Mini Pecan Pies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free mini pecan pies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking to ensure the best texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep the butter cold:</strong> Cold butter is essential for creating a flaky crust. If the butter starts to soften while you're working with it, pop the dough back in the fridge for a few minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overfill the crusts:</strong> The filling will expand as it bakes, so be careful not to overfill the crusts to avoid spills.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the pies cool completely:</strong> Allowing the pies to cool completely will help the filling set and make them easier to remove from the muffin tin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Mini Pecan Pies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I make these pies ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make gluten-free mini pecan pies ahead of time. They can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I use a different type of nut?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While pecans are traditional, you can experiment with other nuts like walnuts or almonds for a different flavor profile.</p>

        <h3>3. Are these pies suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This particular recipe contains eggs and butter, so it is not vegan. However, you can try substituting the eggs with a flax egg and using a vegan butter alternative to make a vegan version.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I use a store-bought gluten-free crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, if you're short on time, you can use a store-bought gluten-free pie crust. Just make sure to follow the package instructions for baking.</p>
