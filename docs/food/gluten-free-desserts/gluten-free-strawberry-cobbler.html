<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Strawberry Filling</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced strawberries, granulated sugar, and cornstarch. Toss the mixture gently until the strawberries are evenly coated. The sugar will help draw out the natural juices of the strawberries, while the cornstarch will thicken the filling as it bakes. Set the mixture aside while you prepare the cobbler topping.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the milk and vanilla extract, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense topping.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>

<p>Transfer the strawberry filling to a greased 9x9-inch baking dish. Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler topping over the strawberries, spreading it out slightly but leaving some gaps for the filling to peek through. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Allow the cobbler to cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

<h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>

<p>This gluten-free strawberry cobbler is delicious on its own, but you can elevate it with a few simple additions. Serve it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for a decadent treat. For a healthier option, pair it with a drizzle of honey or a sprinkle of chopped nuts. The possibilities are endless!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use frozen strawberries instead of fresh?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries if fresh ones are not available. However, be sure to thaw and drain them before using to prevent the filling from becoming too watery.</p>

    <h3>2. What gluten-free flour blend works best for this recipe?</h3>
    <p>Any high-quality gluten-free flour blend should work well. Look for one that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch for the best texture.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a dairy-free milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

    <h3>4. How should I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free strawberry cobbler is a delightful dessert that proves you don’t need gluten to enjoy a sweet, comforting treat. With its juicy strawberry filling and tender, fluffy topping, this cobbler is perfect for any occasion—whether it’s a family dinner, a summer picnic, or a cozy night in.
