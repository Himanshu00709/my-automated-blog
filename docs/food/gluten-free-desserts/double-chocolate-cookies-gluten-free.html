    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Double Chocolate Cookies</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use any gluten-free flour for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend, but make sure it contains xanthan gum, which helps bind the ingredients together. If your blend doesn’t include xanthan gum, you may need to add ½ teaspoon to the recipe.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. Additionally, ensure that the chocolate chips you use are dairy-free.</p>

        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 3 months. Simply thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>4. Why are my cookies spreading too much?</h3>
        <p>If your cookies are spreading too much, it could be due to the butter being too soft or the dough being too warm. Try chilling the dough in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before baking to help the cookies hold their shape.</p>
