    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free pear crumble is straightforward and requires minimal effort. Follow these steps to create a dessert that will impress your family and friends:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pears</h3>
    <p>Start by peeling and coring the pears. Slice them into thin wedges and place them in a mixing bowl. Add a tablespoon of coconut sugar and a pinch of cinnamon to the pears, tossing them gently to coat. This step helps to enhance the natural sweetness of the pears and infuse them with flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Crumble Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the almond flour, gluten-free oats, remaining coconut sugar, and cinnamon. Mix well to ensure even distribution of the ingredients. Add the cold butter (or coconut oil) and use your fingers to rub it into the dry mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. This process is crucial for achieving the perfect crumble texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Transfer the prepared pears to a baking dish, spreading them out evenly. Sprinkle the crumble topping over the pears, ensuring they are fully covered. Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the pears are tender. Allow the crumble to cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>A gluten-free pear crumble is versatile and can be served in various ways. Here are a few ideas to elevate your dessert:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Ice Cream:</strong> A scoop of vanilla ice cream pairs beautifully with the warm crumble.</li>
        <li><strong>With Whipped Cream:</strong> For a lighter option, top with freshly whipped cream.</li>
