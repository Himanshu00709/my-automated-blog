    <h1>Gluten-Free Pecan Tarts: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular as more people discover the benefits of a gluten-free diet, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply a desire for healthier eating.

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Pecan Tarts?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free pecan tarts are not only delicious but also offer several health benefits. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, avoiding gluten is essential to prevent adverse health effects.

By opting for gluten-free pecan tarts, you can enjoy a sweet treat without the risk of gluten-related health issues.</p>
    <p>Additionally, gluten-free diets have been associated with improved digestion, increased energy levels, and better nutrient absorption. Pecans, the star ingredient in these tarts, are packed with essential nutrients, including healthy fats, fiber, and antioxidants. They are also a good source of vitamins and minerals such as vitamin E, magnesium, and zinc, which contribute to overall health and well-being.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free pecan tarts.</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, cold unsalted butter, granulated sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Mix until the dough comes together. Press the dough into tart pans, ensuring an even layer on the bottom and sides. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork to prevent it from puffing up during baking.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the chopped pecans, brown sugar, corn syrup, and salt. Stir until the ingredients are well combined. Pour the filling into the prepared tart crusts, spreading it evenly.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Tarts</h3>
    <p>Place the tart pans in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown. Remove the tarts from the oven and let them cool completely before serving.</p>
