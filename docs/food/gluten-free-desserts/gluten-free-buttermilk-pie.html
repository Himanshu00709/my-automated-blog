    <h1>Gluten-Free Buttermilk Pie: A Delicious Twist on a Classic Dessert</h1>

    <p>Buttermilk pie is a classic Southern dessert known for its creamy, custard-like filling and flaky crust.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Crust</h3>

    <p>Start by making the gluten-free pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and a pinch of salt. Add the cold, cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Roll Out the Dough</h3>

    <p>Once the dough has chilled, roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking) to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Carefully transfer the dough to the pie dish, pressing it gently into the edges. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges for a decorative finish. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Filling</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar and eggs until well combined. Add the buttermilk, vanilla extract, and lemon zest (if using), and mix until smooth. Pour the filling into the prepared pie crust.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Pie</h3>

    <p>Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the filling is set and the top is lightly golden. A knife inserted into the center should come out clean. Allow the pie to cool completely before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Buttermilk Pie</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a store-bought gluten-free pie crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a store-bought gluten-free pie crust if you’re short on time. Just make sure to follow the package instructions for pre-baking, if necessary.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of buttermilk?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have buttermilk on hand, you can make a substitute by adding 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar to 1 cup of milk. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes before using.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this pie dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a dairy-free version by using a dairy-free butter substitute and a non-dairy milk alternative (like almond or oat milk) mixed with lemon juice to mimic buttermilk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftover pie?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover pie in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container, for up to 3 days. You can also freeze the pie for up to 2 months.</p>
