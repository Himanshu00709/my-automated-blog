    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Hello Dolly Bars</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free Hello Dolly Bars is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create your own batch of these delicious treats:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your bars bake evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> Crush the gluten-free graham crackers into fine crumbs. Mix the crumbs with melted butter and press the mixture into the bottom of a greased 9x13 inch baking dish to form the crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer the Ingredients:</strong> Evenly sprinkle the gluten-free chocolate chips, shredded coconut, and chopped nuts over the crust. Drizzle the sweetened condensed milk over the top, ensuring it covers all the layers.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the center is set.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the bars to cool completely before cutting them into squares. Serve and enjoy!</li>
