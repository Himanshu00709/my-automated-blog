    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making this gluten-free lemon raspberry cake:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Flavorings:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Then, mix in the lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. Fold in the Greek yogurt until the batter is smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Raspberries:</strong> Gently fold in the fresh raspberries, being careful not to crush them too much. This will ensure that you get bursts of raspberry flavor throughout the cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can dust it with powdered sugar or top it with a lemon glaze for extra flavor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Lemon Raspberry Cake</h2>
    <p>To ensure your cake turns out perfectly every time, here are a few tips to keep in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh lemon zest and juice, as well as fresh raspberries, will give your cake the best flavor. Avoid using bottled lemon juice if possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking your cake at the 30-minute mark. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it Cool:</strong> Allow the cake to cool completely before slicing. This will help it set and make it easier to cut into neat slices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen raspberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen raspberries, but be sure to thaw and drain them well before adding them to the batter. Frozen raspberries can release more moisture, which may affect the texture of the cake.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and use a dairy-free yogurt in place of Greek yogurt.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend you prefer. Just make sure it’s a 1:1 substitute for all-purpose flour to ensure the right texture.</p>
    </div>
