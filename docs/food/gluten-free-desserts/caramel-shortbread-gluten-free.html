<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>1. Preparing the Shortbread Base</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 160°C (325°F). In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, softened butter, and caster sugar. Mix until the ingredients come together to form a dough. Press the dough evenly into a lined baking tin, ensuring it is compact and smooth. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the base to cool completely before adding the caramel layer.</p>

<h3>2. Making the Caramel Layer</h3>

<p>In a saucepan, combine the condensed milk, golden syrup, and the remaining butter. Heat the mixture over low heat, stirring continuously until it thickens and turns a rich caramel color. This process can take around 10-15 minutes. Once the caramel is ready, pour it over the cooled shortbread base and spread it evenly. Allow the caramel to set for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>3. Adding the Chocolate Topping</h3>

<p>Melt the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water, or in the microwave in short bursts. Once the chocolate is smooth and fully melted, pour it over the set caramel layer. Use a spatula to spread the chocolate evenly. If desired, sprinkle a pinch of sea salt over the chocolate for a touch of contrast. Allow the chocolate to set completely before cutting the shortbread into squares or bars.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Caramel Shortbread</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a good-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that contains xanthan gum, which helps to bind the ingredients and mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t rush the caramel:</strong> Making caramel requires patience. Cook it slowly over low heat to avoid burning and to achieve the perfect consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Let each layer set completely:</strong> Rushing the process can result in messy layers. Allow the shortbread base, caramel, and chocolate to set fully before moving on to the next step.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use dairy-free ingredients for this recipe?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make this recipe dairy-free by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using dairy-free condensed milk and chocolate. Just ensure that all ingredients are gluten-free as well.</p>

    <h3>How should I store gluten-free caramel shortbread?</h3>
    <p>Store the shortbread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. If the weather is warm, you may want to keep it in the refrigerator to prevent the chocolate from melting.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free caramel shortbread?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the shortbread for up to 3 months. Wrap individual pieces in cling film and place them in a freezer-safe container. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>
