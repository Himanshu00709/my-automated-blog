    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Shortbread Base:</strong> Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, cold butter, and caster sugar. Use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Press the mixture into a lined baking tin and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow to cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Caramel Layer:</strong> In a saucepan, combine the condensed milk, golden syrup, and butter. Heat gently, stirring continuously, until the mixture thickens and turns a golden caramel color. Pour the caramel over the cooled shortbread base and spread evenly. Allow to set in the fridge for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Chocolate Topping:</strong> Melt the dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Once melted, pour the chocolate over the caramel layer and spread evenly. Allow to set in the fridge for another hour before cutting into squares and serving.</li>
    </ol>
