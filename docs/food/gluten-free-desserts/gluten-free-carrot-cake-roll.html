    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free carrot cake roll may seem intimidating, but with the right steps, it’s easier than you think. Follow these instructions to create a perfect roll every time.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cake Batter</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. In a separate large bowl, beat the eggs and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract and mix well. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in the grated carrots.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Line a 15x10-inch jelly roll pan with parchment paper and lightly grease it. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the cake is set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. While the cake is baking, lay out a clean kitchen towel and dust it with powdered sugar.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Roll the Cake</h3>
    <p>Once the cake is done, immediately invert it onto the prepared towel. Carefully peel off the parchment paper. Starting from one of the short ends, roll the cake and towel together into a log. Let it cool completely on a wire rack.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the cake is cooling, prepare the cream cheese filling. In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and butter together until smooth and creamy.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Assemble the Roll</h3>
    <p>Once the cake has cooled, carefully unroll it. Spread the cream cheese filling evenly over the cake, leaving a small border around the edges. Gently roll the cake back up, this time without the towel. Wrap the roll in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfecting Your Gluten-Free Carrot Cake Roll</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free carrot cake roll turns out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll the cake while it’s warm:</strong> Rolling the cake while it’s still warm helps prevent cracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill before serving:</strong> Chilling the roll helps it set and makes it easier to slice.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this recipe dairy-free by using dairy-free cream cheese and butter substitutes. Just make sure to check the labels to ensure they are gluten-free as well.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the carrot cake roll?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the carrot cake roll. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. It can be stored in the freezer for up to 2 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before serving.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of cream cheese for the filling?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have cream cheese, you can use mascarpone cheese or a mixture of Greek yogurt and whipped cream for a lighter filling.</p>
