    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free carrot cake roll may seem intimidating, but with the right steps, it’s actually quite straightforward. Follow these instructions to create a delicious and visually stunning dessert:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Cake Batter</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. In a separate large bowl, beat the eggs and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract and mix well. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in the grated carrots.</p>

    <h3>2. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Line a 15x10-inch jelly roll pan with parchment paper and lightly grease it. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the cake is set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. While the cake is baking, lay out a clean kitchen towel and dust it with powdered sugar.</p>

    <h3>3. Roll the Cake</h3>
    <p>Once the cake is done baking, immediately invert it onto the prepared towel. Carefully peel off the parchment paper. Starting from one of the short ends, roll the cake up in the towel. Let it cool completely while rolled up.</p>

    <h3>4. Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the cake is cooling, prepare the cream cheese filling. In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and butter together until smooth and creamy.</p>

    <h3>5. Assemble the Cake Roll</h3>
    <p>Once the cake has cooled, carefully unroll it from the towel. Spread the cream cheese filling evenly over the cake, leaving a small border around the edges. Gently roll the cake back up, this time without the towel. Wrap the rolled cake in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this recipe dairy-free by substituting the cream cheese and butter with dairy-free alternatives. There are many dairy-free cream cheese and butter options available in most grocery stores.</p>

        <h3>How long does a gluten-free carrot cake roll last?</h3>
        <p>A gluten-free carrot cake roll can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Make sure to keep it wrapped in plastic wrap or in an airtight container to maintain its freshness.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the cake roll?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cake roll for up to 2 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil before placing it in the freezer. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have a gluten-free flour blend, you can use almond flour or coconut flour as alternatives. However, keep in mind that these flours may alter the texture of the cake slightly.</p>
