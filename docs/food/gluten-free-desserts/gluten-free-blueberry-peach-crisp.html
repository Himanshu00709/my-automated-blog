    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your crisp bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown topping.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Fruit Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the fresh blueberries, sliced peaches, lemon juice, and honey or maple syrup. Gently toss the fruits to ensure they are evenly coated. The lemon juice adds a touch of acidity that balances the sweetness of the fruits, while the honey or maple syrup enhances their natural flavors.</p>

    <h3>3. Make the Crisp Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the almond flour, gluten-free oats, melted coconut oil, cinnamon, and salt. Stir until the mixture is well combined and crumbly. The almond flour provides a nutty flavor and a gluten-free base, while the oats add a satisfying crunch. The coconut oil binds the ingredients together and adds a subtle richness to the topping.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Transfer the fruit mixture to a baking dish and spread it out evenly. Sprinkle the crisp topping over the fruit, ensuring it covers the entire surface. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling. The aroma of baked peaches and blueberries will fill your kitchen, making it hard to wait for the crisp to cool!</p>

    <h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the crisp to cool for a few minutes before serving. You can enjoy it as is or pair it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra indulgent treat. The combination of warm, juicy fruit and crunchy topping is simply irresistible.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

    <p>This gluten-free blueberry peach crisp is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants, which help protect your body from oxidative stress and inflammation. Peaches are a good source of vitamins A and C, which support immune function and skin health. Almond flour provides healthy fats and protein, while gluten-free oats offer fiber that aids in digestion. By choosing natural sweeteners like honey or maple syrup, you avoid the refined sugars found in many traditional desserts.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen fruits instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries and peaches if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to prevent excess moisture in the crisp.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe can easily be made vegan by substituting honey with maple syrup. Ensure that the gluten-free oats you use are certified vegan, as some brands may process oats in facilities that handle dairy products.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this crisp ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the crisp up to a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. Simply reheat it in the oven before serving to restore the crispiness of the topping.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of almond flour?</h3>
        <p>If you have a nut allergy, you can substitute almond flour with oat flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Keep in mind that this may slightly alter the texture and flavor of the topping.</p>
