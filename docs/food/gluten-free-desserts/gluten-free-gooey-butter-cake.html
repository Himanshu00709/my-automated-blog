    <h1>Gluten-Free Gooey Butter Cake: A Delicious Twist on a Classic</h1>
    <p>Gooey Butter Cake is a beloved dessert that originated in St. Louis, Missouri, and has since become a favorite across the United States. Known for its rich, buttery flavor and irresistibly gooey texture, this cake is a treat that’s hard to resist. But what if you’re following a gluten-free diet? Fear not! With a few simple substitutions, you can enjoy a gluten-free version of this classic dessert that’s just as delicious as the original.</p>

    <h2>What is Gooey Butter Cake?</h2>
    <p>Gooey Butter Cake is a unique dessert that consists of two layers: a dense, cake-like bottom layer and a soft, gooey top layer.

The result is a dessert that’s just as rich and indulgent as the original, but without the gluten.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Gooey Butter Cake</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free Gooey Butter Cake is surprisingly easy. Follow these steps to create a dessert that will impress your friends and family:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x9 inch baking pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Bottom Layer:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Spread this mixture evenly into the prepared baking pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Gooey Layer:</strong> In another bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth. Add the powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and one egg, and mix until well combined. Pour this mixture over the bottom layer in the baking pan, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the center is still slightly jiggly. Be careful not to overbake, as the gooey texture is what makes this cake special.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares and serving. Dust with additional powdered sugar if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Gooey Butter Cake</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free Gooey Butter Cake turns out perfectly, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Make sure your butter, cream cheese, and eggs are at room temperature before you start. This will help them blend together more smoothly.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> When combining the dry and wet ingredients, mix until just combined. Overmixing can lead to a dense cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> The cake is done when the edges are golden brown and the center is still slightly jiggly. Overbaking can result in a cake that’s too firm.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it Cool:</strong> Allow the cake to cool completely before cutting into it. This will help the layers set and make it easier to slice.</li>
    </ul>
