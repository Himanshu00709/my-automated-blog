<h2>How to Make Rhubarb Gluten-Free Crumble</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Rhubarb</h3>

<p>Start by washing and chopping the rhubarb into 1-inch pieces. Place the rhubarb in a mixing bowl and toss it with granulated sugar. Let it sit for about 15 minutes to allow the sugar to draw out some of the rhubarb’s natural juices.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Make the Crumble Topping</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, rolled oats, brown sugar, and ground cinnamon. Cut the butter into small pieces and add it to the dry ingredients. Use your fingers to rub the butter into the mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the vanilla extract for added flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Transfer the rhubarb mixture to a baking dish and spread it out evenly. Sprinkle the crumble topping over the rhubarb, making sure to cover it completely. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the rhubarb is bubbling.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Allow the crumble to cool slightly before serving. It pairs wonderfully with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. Enjoy your gluten-free rhubarb crumble warm or at room temperature.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan margarine. The rest of the ingredients are naturally vegan-friendly.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
