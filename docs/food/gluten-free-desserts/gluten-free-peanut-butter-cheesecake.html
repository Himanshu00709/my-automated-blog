    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's walk through the steps to create this delectable gluten-free peanut butter cheesecake. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure a perfect result.</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (163°C). In a medium-sized bowl, combine the crushed gluten-free graham crackers with the melted butter. Mix until the crumbs are evenly coated. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, ensuring an even layer. Bake the crust for about 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Cheesecake Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until it is smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar, continuing to beat until well combined. Next, add the peanut butter and vanilla extract, mixing until the ingredients are fully incorporated. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Finally, pour in the heavy cream and salt, and mix until the filling is smooth and uniform.</p>

    <h3>3. Bake the Cheesecake</h3>
    <p>Pour the cheesecake filling over the cooled crust in the springform pan. Smooth the top with a spatula to ensure an even surface. Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 50-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center is still slightly jiggly. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool inside with the door slightly ajar for about an hour. This gradual cooling process helps prevent cracking.</p>

    <h3>4. Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the cheesecake has cooled to room temperature, transfer it to the refrigerator and let it chill for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. This allows the flavors to meld and the texture to set perfectly. When ready to serve, remove the cheesecake from the springform pan, slice, and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different nut butter instead of peanut butter?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute peanut butter with almond butter, cashew butter, or any other nut butter of your choice. Just keep in mind that the flavor profile will change slightly depending on the nut butter you use.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover cheesecake?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover cheesecake in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It will keep well for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cheesecake for up to 2 months. To serve, simply thaw it in the refrigerator overnight.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cheesecake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a dairy-free version by using dairy-free cream cheese and butter substitutes. There are many plant-based options available that work well in cheesecake recipes.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free graham crackers for the crust?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have gluten-free graham crackers, you can use gluten-free cookies, almond flour, or even crushed nuts mixed with a bit of sugar and butter to create a crust.</p>
