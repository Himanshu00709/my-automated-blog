    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Pie Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by making the pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and a pinch of salt. Add the cold butter cubes and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has chilled, roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pie dish, pressing it gently into the edges. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges for a decorative finish. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork to prevent air bubbles during baking.</p>

    <h3>3. Prepare the Strawberry Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, combine the sliced strawberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Mix well to ensure the strawberries are evenly coated. Let the mixture sit for about 10 minutes to allow the strawberries to release their juices.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble and Bake the Pie</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Pour the strawberry filling into the prepared pie crust. If desired, you can add a lattice top or a full crust on top. Bake the pie for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Allow the pie to cool completely before serving to let the filling set.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Strawberry Pie</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen strawberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries, but make sure to thaw and drain them thoroughly to avoid excess moisture in the filling.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of cornstarch for thickening?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use cornstarch, you can substitute it with tapioca starch or arrowroot powder. Both work well as thickeners in gluten-free pies.</p>

        <h3>How do I store gluten-free strawberry pie?</h3>
        <p>Store the pie in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container, for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the pie for up to 2 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the pie crust ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the pie crust up to 2 days in advance and keep it refrigerated. Alternatively, you can freeze the dough for up to 3 months.</p>
    </div>
