    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make these delicious gluten-free blueberry crumble bars:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crumble Mixture:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, rolled oats, coconut sugar, and salt. Mix well. Add the melted butter (or coconut oil) and vanilla extract, and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>

        <li><strong>Add the Topping:</strong> Sprinkle the remaining crumble mixture over the blueberry layer, ensuring an even distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the blueberry filling is bubbling.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the bars to cool completely in the pan before cutting them into squares. Serve and enjoy!</li>
