    <h1>Gluten-Free Brookies: A Perfect Blend of Brownies and Cookies</h1>
    <p>Brookies, the delightful combination of brownies and cookies, have taken the dessert world by storm.

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Brookies</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free brookies is a straightforward process, but it requires attention to detail to ensure that both the brownie and cookie layers come out perfectly. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Brownie Batter</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking dish with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in half of the chocolate chips.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Cookie Dough</h3>
    <p>In another bowl, mix together the almond flour, gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Fold in the remaining chocolate chips.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Layer the Batter and Dough</h3>
    <p>Spread the brownie batter evenly in the prepared baking dish. Drop spoonfuls of the cookie dough on top of the brownie batter, spreading it out as evenly as possible. Use a knife or spatula to gently swirl the two layers together, creating a marbled effect.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Brookies</h3>
    <p>Bake the brookies in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs. Be careful not to overbake, as the brookies will continue to cook slightly as they cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the brookies to cool in the baking dish for at least 15 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, cut into squares and serve. Enjoy your gluten-free brookies with a glass of milk or a scoop of ice cream for an extra treat!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Brookies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. However, keep in mind that different blends may affect the texture and flavor of the brookies. It’s best to use a blend that is specifically designed for baking.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these brookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or margarine. Just make sure that the chocolate chips you use are also dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free brookies?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free brookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 2 months. Just make sure to wrap them tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil before freezing.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or other mix-ins?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize your brookies by adding nuts, dried fruit, or other mix-ins. Just be sure to chop any large pieces into smaller, bite-sized chunks so that they distribute evenly throughout the batter.</p>
