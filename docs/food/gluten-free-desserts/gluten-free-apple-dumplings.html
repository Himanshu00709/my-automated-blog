<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free apple dumplings is a straightforward process that involves preparing the dough, filling the apples, and baking them to perfection. Follow these steps to create your own gluten-free apple dumplings:</p>

<h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour and xanthan gum (if needed). Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the cold water, mixing until the dough comes together. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Apples</h3>

<p>While the dough is chilling, peel and core the apples. In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Stuff each apple with this mixture, ensuring that the filling is evenly distributed.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble the Dumplings</h3>

<p>Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Cut the dough into four equal pieces. Place an apple in the center of each piece of dough and wrap the dough around the apple, sealing the edges. Place the wrapped apples in a baking dish.</p>

<h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the apple dumplings for 35-40 minutes, or until the dough is golden brown and the apples are tender. Allow the dumplings to cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>

<p>Gluten-free apple dumplings are best served warm, ideally with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a drizzle of caramel sauce. The combination of the warm, spiced apples and the cool, creamy ice cream is simply irresistible. You can also serve them with a dollop of whipped cream or a sprinkle of powdered sugar for an extra touch of sweetness.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as almond flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary depending on the type of flour you use.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these dumplings ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the dough and stuff the apples a day in advance. Simply wrap the assembled dumplings in plastic wrap and refrigerate until you're ready to bake them.</p>

    <h3>Are gluten-free apple dumplings healthier?</h3>
    <p>While gluten-free apple dumplings are a great option for those with gluten sensitivities, they are still a dessert and should be enjoyed in moderation. However, using gluten-free ingredients can make them a healthier choice for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
