    <h1>Gluten-Free Key Lime Bars: A Zesty Delight</h1>
    <p>Key lime bars are a classic dessert that combines the tangy flavor of key limes with a sweet, buttery crust. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying this treat might seem challenging, but with the right ingredients and techniques, you can create a delicious gluten-free version that rivals the traditional recipe. In this blog post, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free key lime bars, from their history to a step-by-step recipe, and answer some common questions about this delightful dessert.</p>

    <h2>The History of Key Lime Bars</h2>
    <p>Key lime bars, also known as key lime pie bars, are a variation of the famous key lime pie. The key lime pie itself has its roots in the Florida Keys, where key limes were abundant. The pie became popular in the early 20th century, and its tangy, refreshing flavor quickly made it a favorite dessert across the United States. The bar version of this dessert offers a more portable and shareable option, making it perfect for picnics, parties, and potlucks.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity in recent years, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals looking to reduce inflammation or improve digestive health. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause adverse reactions in some people. By using gluten-free ingredients, you can enjoy the same delicious flavors without the discomfort or health risks associated with gluten.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free key lime bars:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a medium bowl, combine the crushed gluten-free graham crackers, melted butter, and granulated sugar. Mix until the crumbs are evenly coated. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of an 8x8-inch baking dish lined with parchment paper. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and let it cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sweetened condensed milk until smooth. Gradually add the key lime juice and zest, continuing to whisk until the mixture is well combined and slightly thickened. Pour the filling over the pre-baked crust, spreading it evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake and Chill</h3>
    <p>Bake the bars in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the filling is set but still slightly jiggly in the center. Remove from the oven and let the bars cool to room temperature. Once cooled, transfer the dish to the refrigerator and chill for at least 2 hours, or until the bars are firm.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the bars are fully chilled, lift them out of the baking dish using the parchment paper. Cut into squares and dust with powdered sugar if desired. Serve chilled and enjoy the tangy, creamy goodness of your gluten-free key lime bars!</p>
