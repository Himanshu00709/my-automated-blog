    <h1>Gluten-Free Pear Cake: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>When it comes to desserts, few things are as comforting and satisfying as a moist, flavorful cake. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding the perfect cake recipe can be a challenge. Enter the gluten-free pear cake—a delightful dessert that combines the natural sweetness of pears with a light, fluffy texture. This cake is not only gluten-free but also packed with nutrients, making it a guilt-free indulgence for everyone.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Pear Cake?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has gained immense popularity in recent years, and for good reason. Many people suffer from gluten intolerance or celiac disease, which makes consuming gluten-containing foods harmful to their health. Even for those without gluten sensitivities, reducing gluten intake can lead to better digestion and overall well-being. Pears, on the other hand, are a fantastic fruit to incorporate into desserts. They are naturally sweet, high in fiber, and rich in vitamins like vitamin C and potassium. Combining these two elements results in a cake that is not only delicious but also nutritious.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free pear cake is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a delicious dessert that will impress your family and friends:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes using an electric mixer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined; do not overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the Pears:</strong> Gently fold the sliced pears into the batter. Be careful not to break the pear slices.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Cake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
