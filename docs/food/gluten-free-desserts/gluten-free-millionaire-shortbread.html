    <h1>Gluten-Free Millionaire Shortbread: A Decadent Treat for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Millionaire shortbread is a classic dessert that combines a buttery shortbread base, a rich caramel layer, and a smooth chocolate topping. Traditionally, this indulgent treat contains gluten, making it off-limits for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, with the rise of gluten-free baking, it's now possible to enjoy this luxurious dessert without compromising on taste or texture. In this article, we'll explore the world of gluten-free millionaire shortbread, from its origins to how you can make it at home.</p>

    <h2>The Origins of Millionaire Shortbread</h2>

    <p>Millionaire shortbread, also known as caramel shortbread, is believed to have originated in Scotland.

The traditional recipe consists of three layers: a crumbly shortbread base, a gooey caramel middle, and a glossy chocolate topping. Over the years, this dessert has gained popularity worldwide, and today, it's a staple in bakeries and home kitchens alike.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Shortbread Base</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 180°C (160°C fan) and lining a baking tin with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, caster sugar, and cold, cubed butter. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Press the mixture firmly into the prepared tin, ensuring it's evenly distributed. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the base to cool completely before adding the caramel layer.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Caramel Layer</h3>

    <p>In a saucepan, combine the condensed milk, golden syrup, and the remaining butter. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring continuously until it thickens and turns a rich caramel color. This process can take around 10-15 minutes. Once the caramel is ready, pour it over the cooled shortbread base and spread it evenly. Allow the caramel to set in the fridge for at least 1 hour.</p>

    <h3>3. Adding the Chocolate Topping</h3>

    <p>Break the dark chocolate into pieces and melt it in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, or in the microwave in short bursts. Once melted, pour the chocolate over the set caramel layer and spread it evenly. Return the tin to the fridge and allow the chocolate to set completely, which should take about 1-2 hours. Once set, remove the shortbread from the tin and cut it into squares or rectangles.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Millionaire Shortbread</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't rush the caramel:</strong> Cooking the caramel slowly ensures it thickens properly and doesn't burn. Stir continuously to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill between layers:</strong> Allowing each layer to set completely before adding the next ensures clean, distinct layers.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with toppings:</strong> While dark chocolate is traditional, you can also use milk chocolate, white chocolate, or even a drizzle of salted caramel for a twist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this recipe dairy-free by using dairy-free butter and condensed milk, as well as dairy-free chocolate for the topping. Many brands offer dairy-free alternatives that work well in baking.</p>

        <h3>How long does gluten-free millionaire shortbread last?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free millionaire shortbread can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze it for up to 3 months. Just make sure to wrap it well to prevent freezer burn.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of sugar?</h3>
        <p>While caster sugar is recommended for the shortbread base, you can experiment with other sugars like coconut sugar or brown sugar for a different flavor profile. Keep in mind that this may alter the texture slightly.</p>

        <h3>Is gluten-free millionaire shortbread healthier?</h3>
        <p>While gluten-free millionaire shortbread is suitable for those with gluten intolerance, it's still a rich and indulgent dessert. It contains high amounts of sugar and fat, so it's best enjoyed in moderation as part of a balanced diet.</p>
