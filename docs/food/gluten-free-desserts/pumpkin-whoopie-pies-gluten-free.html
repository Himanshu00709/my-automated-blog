    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free pumpkin whoopie pies:</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Pumpkin Cookies</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract and pumpkin puree. Gradually mix in the dry ingredients until a smooth batter forms.</p>

    <h3>2. Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Drop spoonfuls of the batter onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the cookies are set and lightly golden around the edges. Allow them to cool completely on a wire rack.</p>

    <h3>3. Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the cookies are cooling, prepare the filling. In a mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar, mixing until the filling is creamy and well combined. If desired, you can add a splash of vanilla extract for extra flavor.</p>

    <h3>4. Assemble the Whoopie Pies</h3>
    <p>Once the cookies are completely cool, spread a generous amount of the cream cheese filling onto the flat side of one cookie. Top with another cookie, pressing gently to create a sandwich. Repeat with the remaining cookies and filling.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Whoopie Pies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free pumpkin whoopie pies turn out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a reliable gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the cookies cool completely:</strong> This will prevent the filling from melting and make the whoopie pies easier to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Keep the whoopie pies in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. They can also be frozen for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these whoopie pies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make these whoopie pies dairy-free by using a dairy-free butter alternative and a dairy-free cream cheese substitute. Just make sure to check the labels to ensure they are also gluten-free.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin puree?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer to use fresh pumpkin, simply roast or steam a small sugar pumpkin, then puree the flesh until smooth. Make sure to drain any excess liquid to achieve the right consistency.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I know if my gluten-free flour blend is good for baking?</h3>
        <p>Look for a gluten-free flour blend that contains a mix of flours and starches, such as rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch. These blends are typically designed to mimic the texture of all-purpose flour and work well in baking.</p>
    </div>
