    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Cake Batter</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and greasing a 9-inch square baking pan. In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>2. Adding the Apples</h3>

    <p>Once the batter is ready, gently fold in the diced apples. The apples will add moisture and flavor to the cake, so make sure they are evenly distributed throughout the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it out evenly with a spatula.</p>

    <h3>3. Making the Crumb Topping</h3>

    <p>In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, and a few tablespoons of gluten-free flour. Cut in the softened butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle the crumb topping evenly over the cake batter.</p>

    <h3>4. Baking the Cake</h3>

    <p>Place the cake in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The crumb topping should be golden brown and the cake should be firm to the touch. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Serving and Storing</h2>

    <p>Once the cake has cooled, it's ready to be served. You can enjoy it as is, or with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra treat. Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months. Simply wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer-safe bag.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the apples with other fruits like pears, peaches, or berries. Just make sure to adjust the baking time if necessary, as different fruits may release more or less moisture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine. Just make sure to use a dairy-free version of all other ingredients as well.</p>

        <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best?</h3>
        <p>A blend that includes xanthan gum, such as Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free 1-to-1 Baking Flour, works well for this recipe. It helps to mimic the texture of traditional flour.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the cake a day in advance. Store it in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator. You can also freeze it for longer storage.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Gluten-free apple crumb cake is a delightful dessert that combines the flavors of sweet apples, a moist cake base, and a crunchy crumb topping. With the right ingredients and a little bit of patience, you can create a gluten-free version of this classic treat that everyone will love.
