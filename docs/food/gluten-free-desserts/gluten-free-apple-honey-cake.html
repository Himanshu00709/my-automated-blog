    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Apple Honey Cake</h2>
    <p>Now that we’ve covered the key ingredients, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making this delicious gluten-free apple honey cake:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 ½ cups of almond flour, ½ cup of coconut flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Whisk these dry ingredients together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together 3 large eggs, ½ cup of honey, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract until smooth. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a thick batter forms.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Apples</h3>
    <p>Peel and dice 2 medium-sized apples into small pieces. Fold the apple pieces into the batter, ensuring they are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve with a drizzle of honey or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra touch of indulgence.</p>
