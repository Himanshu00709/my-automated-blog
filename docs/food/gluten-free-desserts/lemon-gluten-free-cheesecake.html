    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (160°C). In a food processor, pulse the gluten-free graham crackers (or almond flour) until they form fine crumbs. Mix the crumbs with melted butter until well combined. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, ensuring an even layer. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract, mixing until fully incorporated. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Finally, fold in the sour cream until the mixture is smooth and uniform.</p>

    <h3>3. Baking the Cheesecake</h3>
    <p>Pour the filling over the cooled crust and smooth the top with a spatula. Place the springform pan in a larger baking dish and fill the dish with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the pan. This water bath will help prevent cracks in the cheesecake. Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door slightly ajar for about an hour. Then, refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Lemon Gluten-Free Cheesecake</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Ensure that your cream cheese and eggs are at room temperature before mixing. This helps create a smoother filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Water Bath:</strong> Don’t skip the water bath! It’s crucial for preventing cracks and ensuring even baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill Time:</strong> Allow the cheesecake to chill thoroughly in the refrigerator. This helps it set properly and enhances the flavors.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish:</strong> Before serving, garnish with fresh lemon slices, whipped cream, or a dusting of powdered sugar for an extra touch of elegance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular graham crackers instead of gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have a gluten intolerance, you can certainly use regular graham crackers for the crust. However, for a truly gluten-free dessert, stick to gluten-free graham crackers or almond flour.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this cheesecake ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! In fact, cheesecake often tastes better the next day after the flavors have had time to meld. You can make it up to 2 days in advance and store it in the refrigerator.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I freeze lemon gluten-free cheesecake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze this cheesecake. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, then store it in the freezer for up to 2 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What can I use instead of sour cream?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have sour cream, you can substitute it with Greek yogurt. It will provide a similar tanginess and creaminess to the cheesecake.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <p>The <strong>Lemon Gluten-Free Cheesecake</strong> is a delightful dessert that combines the creamy richness of traditional cheesecake with the bright, zesty flavor of lemon.
