    <h1>Gluten-Free Berry Cake: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>In recent years, gluten-free diets have gained immense popularity, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also among health-conscious individuals looking to reduce their gluten intake. One of the most delightful ways to enjoy a gluten-free lifestyle is by indulging in a moist, flavorful, and nutrient-packed gluten-free berry cake. This cake is not only a treat for your taste buds but also a healthier alternative to traditional cakes. In this blog post, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free baking, provide a detailed recipe for a gluten-free berry cake, and answer some frequently asked questions about gluten-free desserts.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Baking?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking has become a cornerstone of modern culinary practices, especially for those who need to avoid gluten for health reasons. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and other health problems for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. However, even for those without these conditions, reducing gluten intake can lead to improved digestion, reduced inflammation, and better overall health.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free baking often relies on alternative flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or rice flour, which are naturally gluten-free and packed with nutrients. These flours not only provide a unique texture and flavor but also offer additional health benefits, such as higher protein content and lower glycemic index. When combined with fresh berries, which are rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and fiber, a gluten-free berry cake becomes a powerhouse of nutrition and flavor.</p>

    <p>Now that we’ve discussed the benefits of gluten-free baking, let’s dive into the recipe for a delicious gluten-free berry cake. This recipe is easy to follow and yields a moist, fluffy cake that’s perfect for any occasion.</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use frozen berries instead of fresh ones?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen berries in this recipe. However, make sure to thaw and drain them before adding them to the batter to prevent excess moisture, which could affect the texture of the cake.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I substitute almond flour with another gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour provides a unique texture and flavor to the cake, but you can substitute it with other gluten-free flours like oat flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store the gluten-free berry cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months. Just make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil before freezing.</p>

        <h3>4. Is this cake suitable for people with nut allergies?</h3>

        <h3>5. Can I make this cake vegan?</h3>
