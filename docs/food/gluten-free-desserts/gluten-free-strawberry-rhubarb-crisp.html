    <h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Dessert?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular in recent years, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals looking to improve their overall health. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and inflammation in some people. By opting for gluten-free desserts, you can enjoy your favorite treats without the discomfort or health risks associated with gluten consumption.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free baking often incorporates nutrient-dense ingredients like almond flour, oats, and coconut oil, which can add a nutritional boost to your desserts. This gluten-free strawberry rhubarb crisp is a perfect example of how you can create a dessert that is both delicious and health-conscious.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients You'll Need</h2>

    <p>Before diving into the recipe, let's take a look at the ingredients you'll need to make this delightful dessert. The ingredients are divided into two parts: the fruit filling and the crisp topping.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Fruit Filling</th>
                <th>Crisp Topping</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>4 cups fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced</td>
                <td>1 cup gluten-free rolled oats</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2 cups rhubarb, chopped into 1-inch pieces</td>
                <td>1/2 cup almond flour</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1/2 cup granulated sugar</td>
                <td>1/4 cup coconut sugar</td>
            </tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</td>
                <td>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1 tablespoon lemon juice</td>

    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's walk through the steps to create this gluten-free strawberry rhubarb crisp.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your crisp bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown topping.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Fruit Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced strawberries and chopped rhubarb. Add the granulated sugar, cornstarch, vanilla extract, and lemon juice. Gently toss the mixture until the fruit is evenly coated. Set aside while you prepare the crisp topping.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Crisp Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free rolled oats, almond flour, coconut sugar, salt, and ground cinnamon. Add the cold, cubed butter and use your fingers or a pastry cutter to work the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Transfer the fruit mixture to a greased 9x9-inch baking dish. Sprinkle the crisp topping evenly over the fruit. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit filling is bubbling.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the crisp to cool for at least 10 minutes before serving. This allows the filling to set slightly, making it easier to serve. Enjoy warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra treat.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Strawberry Rhubarb Crisp</h2>

    <p>This gluten-free strawberry rhubarb crisp isn't just delicious—it's also packed with nutritional benefits. Strawberries are rich in vitamin C, antioxidants, and fiber, which support immune health and digestion. Rhubarb, while often used as a fruit in desserts, is actually a vegetable that provides a good source of vitamin K, calcium, and potassium. The almond flour in the crisp topping adds healthy fats and protein, making this dessert a more balanced option compared to traditional crisps made with refined flour.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen strawberries and rhubarb?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries and rhubarb if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them well before using to prevent the filling from becoming too watery.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make this recipe vegan, simply replace the butter with a plant-based alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. Ensure that the sugar you use is also vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat the crisp in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour for the topping?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like oat flour or buckwheat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>
    </div>
