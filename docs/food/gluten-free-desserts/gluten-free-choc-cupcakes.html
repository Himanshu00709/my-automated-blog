    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free chocolate cupcakes:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with cupcake liners. This will ensure that your cupcakes bake evenly and don’t stick to the pan.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make sure all the dry ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in your batter.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense cupcakes. Finally, stir in the hot water to thin the batter slightly.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Fill the Cupcake Liners</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or an ice cream scoop, fill each cupcake liner about two-thirds full with the batter. This will give the cupcakes enough room to rise without overflowing.</p>
    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Allow the cupcakes to cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
    <h3>Step 7: Frost and Decorate</h3>
    <p>Once the cupcakes are completely cool, you can frost them with your favorite gluten-free frosting. Chocolate buttercream, cream cheese frosting, or even a simple dusting of powdered sugar all work beautifully. Add some sprinkles or chocolate shavings for an extra touch of indulgence.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chocolate Cupcakes</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use any gluten-free flour for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. However, it’s important to choose a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as some gluten-free flours can be gritty or have a strong flavor. A blend that includes rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch usually works well.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these cupcakes dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can easily make these cupcakes dairy-free by using a non-dairy milk, such as almond milk, coconut milk, or oat milk, and a dairy-free frosting. Just make sure to check the labels on your ingredients to ensure they are free from dairy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store gluten-free chocolate cupcakes?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free chocolate cupcakes can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. If you need to store them longer, you can keep them in the refrigerator for up to a week. For longer storage, you can freeze the cupcakes (without frosting) for up to 3 months.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free chocolate cupcakes are a delightful treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and a little bit of care, you can create moist, rich, and delicious cupcakes that are sure to impress.
