    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free pumpkin blondies is a straightforward process. Follow these steps for perfect results:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Set your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line an 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix wet ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, melted butter, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Add chocolate chips:</strong> Fold in the chocolate chips if using.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the blondies to cool completely before cutting them into squares. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pumpkin Blondies</h2>
    <p>To ensure your blondies turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense blondies. Stir until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a less sweet dessert, reduce the amount of brown sugar or use a sugar substitute.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with add-ins:</strong> Feel free to customize your blondies with nuts, dried fruit, or white chocolate chips.</li>
    </ul>
