<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Cherry Filling</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large bowl, combine the cherries, sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice. Mix well until the cherries are evenly coated. Transfer the mixture to a baking dish and set aside.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Gluten-Free Topping</h3>

<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small pieces and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract until the dough comes together.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>

<p>Drop spoonfuls of the dough over the cherry filling, spreading it out evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the cherry filling is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Cherry Cobbler</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Fresh Cherries:</strong> While frozen cherries work well, fresh cherries will give your cobbler a more vibrant flavor. If using fresh cherries, be sure to pit them before adding them to the filling.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> Feel free to get creative with the topping. You can add a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg for extra flavor, or even mix in some chopped nuts for added texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve Warm:</strong> Cobbler is best served warm, ideally with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use other fruits instead of cherries?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! While cherries are the traditional choice for this cobbler, you can easily substitute them with other fruits like peaches, blueberries, or apples. Just adjust the sugar and cornstarch quantities based on the sweetness and juiciness of the fruit you choose.</p>

    <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>Yes, with a few modifications. Replace the butter with a vegan alternative and use a non-dairy milk like almond or oat milk. The rest of the ingredients are naturally vegan-friendly.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftover cobbler?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat it in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>
