<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Mini Pumpkin Pies</h2>

<p>Now that we've covered the why, let's dive into the how. Making gluten-free mini pumpkin pies is easier than you might think. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create these delightful treats:</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 cup gluten-free flour blend</li>
    <li>1/2 cup almond flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup coconut sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
    <li>2-3 tbsp ice water</li>
    <li>1 cup pumpkin puree</li>
    <li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 tsp pumpkin pie spice</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp nutmeg</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> In a food processor, combine the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, coconut sugar, and salt. Add the cold butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a mini muffin tin with cooking spray or butter.</li>
    <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to about 1/8-inch thickness. Use a round cookie cutter to cut out circles that will fit into the mini muffin tin. Press the dough circles into the muffin tin, ensuring they cover the bottom and sides.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the Filling:</strong> In a mixing bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, coconut milk, maple syrup, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and eggs until smooth.</li>
    <li><strong>Fill the Crusts:</strong> Spoon the pumpkin filling into each crust, filling them about 3/4 full.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the mini pies for 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown. Allow the pies to cool in the tin for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve your gluten-free mini pumpkin pies with a dollop of whipped cream or a sprinkle of cinnamon for an extra touch of flavor.</li>
</ol>
