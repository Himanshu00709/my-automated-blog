    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the base:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, 1 cup of granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the softened butter and one egg, and mix until a dough forms. Press the dough evenly into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the topping:</strong> In another bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the remaining 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, the second egg, and the vanilla extract. Mix until well combined and creamy.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the cake:</strong> Pour the cream cheese mixture over the dough base, spreading it evenly with a spatula.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the center is set but still slightly jiggly.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool completely before dusting with powdered sugar and slicing into squares. Serve at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Ooey Gooey Butter Cake</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free ooey gooey butter cake turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use high-quality gluten-free flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a tough base. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the cake cool completely:</strong> The cake will continue to set as it cools, so resist the temptation to cut into it right away.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> While the classic version is delicious, don’t be afraid to get creative. Add lemon zest, cocoa powder, or even a layer of fruit preserves for a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>
