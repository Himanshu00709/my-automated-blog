    <h1>Gluten-Free Frangipane: A Delightful Twist on a Classic</h1>

    <p>Frangipane, a rich and creamy almond-based filling, has been a staple in French patisserie for centuries. Traditionally used in tarts, pastries, and desserts, frangipane is beloved for its nutty flavor and velvety texture. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic treat can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free frangipane—a delicious alternative that allows everyone to indulge in this timeless delight. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free frangipane, from its origins to how you can make it at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Frangipane?</h2>

    <p>Frangipane is a sweet almond cream made from ground almonds, sugar, butter, and eggs. It’s often flavored with vanilla or almond extract and used as a filling in various desserts. The name "frangipane" is believed to have originated from the Italian nobleman Marquis Muzio Frangipani, who created a perfume with a similar almond scent. Over time, the term became associated with the almond-based filling we know today.</p>

    <p>Traditional frangipane recipes often call for wheat flour to thicken the mixture, making it unsuitable for those avoiding gluten. However, with a few simple substitutions, you can create a gluten-free version that’s just as delicious.</p>

By opting for gluten-free alternatives, you can enjoy your favorite foods without compromising your health.</p>
