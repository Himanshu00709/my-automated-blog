    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Zeppole</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free zeppole is surprisingly simple, and the process is quite similar to making traditional zeppole. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a smooth batter forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong> In a deep frying pan or pot, heat the vegetable oil to 350°F (175°C). Use a thermometer to ensure the oil is at the correct temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Zeppole:</strong> Using a small ice cream scoop or spoon, drop small portions of the dough into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, turning occasionally to ensure even cooking. This should take about 2-3 minutes per batch.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Dust:</strong> Remove the zeppole from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. While still warm, dust them generously with powdered sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Serve the gluten-free zeppole warm, either plain or filled with your favorite custard or jelly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Zeppole</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free zeppole turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will contain the right balance of flours and starches to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor the Oil Temperature:</strong> Maintaining the correct oil temperature is crucial. If the oil is too hot, the zeppole will burn on the outside while remaining raw inside. If it’s too cool, they will absorb too much oil and become greasy.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcrowd the Pan:</strong> Fry the zeppole in small batches to ensure they cook evenly and don’t stick together.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Fillings:</strong> While traditional zeppole are often filled with custard or ricotta, feel free to get creative with your fillings. Chocolate, fruit preserves, or even a savory cheese filling can add a unique twist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Zeppole</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make gluten-free zeppole ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. However, it’s best to fry the zeppole just before serving to ensure they are fresh and crispy.</p>

        <h3>Can I bake gluten-free zeppole instead of frying them?</h3>
        <p>While frying is traditional and gives zeppole their characteristic texture, you can bake them if you prefer a healthier option. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and bake the zeppole on a parchment-lined baking sheet for about 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour blend for zeppole?</h3>
        <p>A blend that includes rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch works well for zeppole. Look for a blend that contains xanthan gum, which helps bind the dough and gives it a more traditional texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free zeppole?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze gluten-free zeppole. Allow them to cool completely, then place them in an airtight container or freezer bag. To reheat, simply place them in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes, or until warmed through.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
