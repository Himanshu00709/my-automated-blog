    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free date brownies is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a batch of delicious, healthy brownies:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper or lightly grease it with coconut oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dates:</strong> Soak the pitted dates in warm water for about 10 minutes to soften them. Drain the water and blend the dates in a food processor until you get a smooth paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, beat the eggs and then mix in the melted coconut oil and vanilla extract. Add the date paste to this mixture and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until you have a smooth batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the brownies to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Cut into squares and serve.</li>
