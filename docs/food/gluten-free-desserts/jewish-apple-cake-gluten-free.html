    <h1>Gluten-Free Jewish Apple Cake: A Delicious Tradition</h1>
    <p>Jewish Apple Cake is a beloved dessert that has been passed down through generations, often enjoyed during Jewish holidays like Rosh Hashanah and Sukkot. Traditionally made with wheat flour, this moist and flavorful cake is packed with layers of fresh apples and warm spices. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic treat can be a challenge. That’s where the gluten-free version of Jewish Apple Cake comes in! In this article, we’ll explore the history of this iconic dessert, provide a step-by-step recipe for a gluten-free version, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>The History of Jewish Apple Cake</h2>
    <p>Jewish Apple Cake has its roots in Eastern European Jewish cuisine, where apples were a staple ingredient due to their abundance and versatility.

Over time, it became a symbol of comfort and tradition, often served during festive occasions. The cake’s unique layering of apples and batter creates a moist, tender crumb that is both satisfying and nostalgic.</p>

By using gluten-free flours like almond flour, rice flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose blend, you can enjoy the same delicious flavors of Jewish Apple Cake without the adverse effects of gluten.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a Bundt pan or a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the granulated sugar, brown sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li>Toss the apple slices with lemon juice to prevent browning.</li>
        <li>Layer half of the batter into the prepared pan, followed by half of the apple slices. Repeat with the remaining batter and apples.</li>
        <li>Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free Jewish Apple Cake turns out perfectly, keep these tips in mind:</p>

        <li>Choose firm, tart apples like Granny Smith or Honeycrisp for the best flavor and texture.</li>
