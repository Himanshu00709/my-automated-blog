    <h1>Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Fudge: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Fudge</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free peanut butter fudge turns out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Ingredients:</strong> Since this recipe has so few ingredients, the quality of each one matters. Opt for natural peanut butter without added sugars or oils, and use pure vanilla extract for the best flavor.</li>

        <li><strong>Chill Properly:</strong> Allow the fudge to chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. This will ensure that it sets properly and is easy to cut into squares.</li>
