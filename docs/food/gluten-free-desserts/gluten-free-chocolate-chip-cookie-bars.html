    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get baking! Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free chocolate chip cookie bars:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan and line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugars:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the eggs and vanilla:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the chocolate chips:</strong> Gently fold in the chocolate chips until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread the dough:</strong> Transfer the dough to the prepared baking pan and spread it out evenly using a spatula.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the bars to cool completely in the pan before cutting them into squares. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookie Bars</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free chocolate chip cookie bars turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense and tough bars. Mix until just combined for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the bars cool completely:</strong> Allowing the bars to cool in the pan ensures they set properly and are easier to cut.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Store the bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours like almond flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. Always ensure your flour blend includes a binding agent like xanthan gum.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these bars dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. Just make sure to use dairy-free chocolate chips as well.</p>

        <h3>How do I know when the bars are done baking?</h3>
        <p>The bars are done when the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs. Be careful not to overbake, as this can result in dry bars.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or other mix-ins?</h3>
        <p>Yes, feel free to customize your bars by adding nuts, dried fruit, or even a swirl of peanut butter. Just be mindful of the total volume of mix-ins to avoid altering the texture too much.</p>
