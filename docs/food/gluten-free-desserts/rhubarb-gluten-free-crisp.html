    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Rhubarb Filling</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large bowl, combine the chopped rhubarb, granulated sugar, and cornstarch. Mix well to ensure that the rhubarb is evenly coated. Transfer the mixture to a baking dish, spreading it out evenly.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Crisp Topping</h3>

    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free oats, almond flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Add the butter (or coconut oil) and mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. You can use your hands or a pastry cutter to achieve the desired texture.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble and Bake</h3>

    <p>Sprinkle the crisp topping evenly over the rhubarb mixture in the baking dish. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the rhubarb filling is bubbling.</p>

    <h3>4. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Allow the crisp to cool slightly before serving. It can be enjoyed on its own or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra treat.</p>
