    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper to ensure easy removal of the cake after baking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the batter.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream the softened butter and granulated sugar together until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for creating a tender crumb in your cake.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla extract for added flavor.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix the batter. Overmixing can lead to a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>6. Incorporate Melted Chocolate</h3>
    <p>Fold in the melted dark chocolate until the batter is smooth and evenly colored. The melted chocolate will give the cake its rich, decadent flavor.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>8. Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can dust it with powdered sugar, top it with fresh berries, or frost it with your favorite gluten-free frosting.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours such as rice flour, coconut flour, or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor of the cake may vary depending on the flour you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a dairy-free milk such as almond, oat, or coconut milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other flavors to the cake?</h3>
        <p>Certainly! You can add a teaspoon of instant coffee to enhance the chocolate flavor, or mix in some orange zest for a citrusy twist. The possibilities are endless!</p>
