    <h1>Gluten-Free Plum Cake: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>Plum cake is a classic dessert that has been enjoyed for generations. Traditionally made with wheat flour, this delightful treat can be a challenge for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. However, with the rise of gluten-free baking, it's now possible to enjoy a gluten-free version of this beloved cake without compromising on taste or texture. In this article, we'll explore the world of gluten-free plum cake, from its health benefits to a step-by-step recipe that you can try at home.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Plum Cake?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking has gained popularity not only among those with gluten intolerance but also among health-conscious individuals. Gluten-free plum cake offers several benefits:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Digestive Health:</strong> For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems. A gluten-free plum cake allows them to enjoy a delicious dessert without the adverse effects.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich Ingredients:</strong> Gluten-free flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour are often more nutrient-dense than traditional wheat flour. These flours provide essential vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower Glycemic Index:</strong> Many gluten-free flours have a lower glycemic index compared to wheat flour, which means they have a slower impact on blood sugar levels. This makes gluten-free plum cake a better option for those managing diabetes or looking to maintain stable energy levels.</li>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Follow these steps to create a delicious gluten-free plum cake:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9-inch round cake pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla extract and lemon zest.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Plums:</strong> Wash and slice the plums into thin wedges. You can leave the skin on for added color and texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Cake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Arrange the plum slices on top of the batter in a circular pattern.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the cake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Plum Cake</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use other fruits instead of plums?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While plums are traditional, you can substitute them with other fruits like peaches, apricots, or even berries. Just make sure to adjust the baking time if the fruit has a higher water content.</p>

        <h3>How do I store gluten-free plum cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, refrigerate it for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months. Just wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer-safe bag.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a vegan version by substituting the butter with coconut oil or a vegan butter alternative, and using flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) instead of regular eggs.</p>

        <h3>Is gluten-free flour blend necessary, or can I use a single type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>While you can use a single type of gluten-free flour, a blend usually yields better results in terms of texture and flavor. Single flours like almond or coconut flour can be dense or dry, so a blend helps balance the cake's consistency.</p>
