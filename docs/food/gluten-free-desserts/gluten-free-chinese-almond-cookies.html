    <h1>Gluten-Free Chinese Almond Cookies: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>Chinese almond cookies are a classic treat, often enjoyed during festive occasions like Chinese New Year. Traditionally, these cookies are made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, many people are seeking gluten-free alternatives. In this blog post, we’ll explore how to make gluten-free Chinese almond cookies that are just as delicious and satisfying as the original version.</p>

    <h2>What Are Chinese Almond Cookies?</h2>

    <p>Chinese almond cookies are a type of shortbread cookie that originated in China. They are known for their crumbly texture, rich almond flavor, and the signature almond placed on top of each cookie. These cookies are often enjoyed during celebrations and are a staple in many Chinese households. The traditional recipe includes ingredients like wheat flour, sugar, butter, and almond extract, but we’ll be adapting it to make it gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems. Even for those without gluten-related conditions, a gluten-free diet can sometimes offer benefits such as improved digestion and reduced inflammation. By making gluten-free Chinese almond cookies, you can enjoy this traditional treat without compromising your health.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Egg and Almond Extract</h3>
    <p>Beat in the egg and almond extract until well combined. The mixture should be smooth and slightly creamy.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cookies tough.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Shape the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a tablespoon or a small cookie scoop, portion out the dough and roll it into balls. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Gently press a whole almond into the center of each cookie.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The cookies will continue to firm up as they cool, so don’t overbake them.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, serve and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Chinese Almond Cookies</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, but make sure they contain xanthan gum or a similar binding agent to achieve the right texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a vegan butter alternative and use a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of a regular egg.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use almond meal instead of almond flour?</h3>
        <p>Almond meal is coarser than almond flour, so it may affect the texture of the cookies. If you use almond meal, the cookies may be slightly denser.</p>
