    <h1>Gluten-Free Chinese Almond Cookies: A Delicious Treat for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Chinese almond cookies are a beloved treat, often enjoyed during festive occasions like Chinese New Year. These cookies are known for their delicate, crumbly texture and rich almond flavor.

    <h2>The History of Chinese Almond Cookies</h2>

    <p>Chinese almond cookies have a long history, dating back to ancient China. They were traditionally made with almond flour, sugar, and lard, giving them a unique texture and flavor.

        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Chinese Almond Cookies</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be able to achieve the perfect texture and flavor:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use high-quality almond flour:</strong> The quality of your almond flour can make a big difference in the texture of your cookies. Look for finely ground almond flour for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough:</strong> If the dough is too soft, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before shaping the cookies. This will make them easier to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch the baking time:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can brown quickly, so keep an eye on them as they bake to prevent over-browning.</li>
    </ul>
