<h1>Gluten-Free Chess Pie: A Delicious Southern Classic</h1>

<p>Chess pie is a beloved Southern dessert known for its rich, custard-like filling and simple ingredients.

In this article, we’ll explore the history of chess pie, how to make a gluten-free version, and answer some frequently asked questions about this delicious dessert.</p>

<h2>The History of Chess Pie</h2>

<p>Chess pie has its roots in the American South, where it became a staple in Southern kitchens. The exact origin of the name is debated, but one popular theory suggests that it comes from the phrase "just pie," which over time morphed into "chess pie." Another theory is that the pie was stored in a pie chest, leading to the name "chest pie," which eventually became "chess pie." Regardless of its name, the pie is characterized by its simple ingredients and sweet, custardy filling.</p>

<p>Traditional chess pie recipes typically include sugar, eggs, butter, and a small amount of cornmeal or flour to thicken the filling. The pie is often flavored with vanilla, lemon, or vinegar, which adds a subtle tanginess to balance the sweetness. The result is a dessert that is both rich and comforting, making it a favorite at family gatherings and holiday celebrations.</p>
