    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Crust</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, oat flour, solid coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Mix until the ingredients come together to form a dough. Press the dough evenly into a tart pan, making sure to cover the bottom and sides. Use a fork to prick the bottom of the crust to prevent it from puffing up during baking. Bake the crust for about 10-12 minutes, or until it turns golden brown. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely.</p>

    <h3>2. Preparing the Blackberry Filling</h3>

    <p>While the crust is cooling, prepare the blackberry filling. In a medium saucepan, combine the fresh blackberries, lemon juice, cornstarch, and honey or agave syrup. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the blackberries break down and the mixture thickens. This should take about 8-10 minutes. Once the filling has thickened, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>3. Assembling the Tart</h3>

    <p>Once both the crust and the filling have cooled, pour the blackberry filling into the crust, spreading it evenly. You can garnish the tart with additional fresh blackberries or a sprinkle of powdered sugar if desired. Allow the tart to set in the refrigerator for at least 1-2 hours before serving.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Blackberry Tart</h2>

    <p>This Gluten-Free Blackberry Tart is not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Blackberries are a rich source of vitamins C and K, as well as dietary fiber, which aids in digestion and promotes gut health. Almond flour, used in the crust, is high in healthy fats, protein, and vitamin E, making it a great alternative to traditional wheat flour. Additionally, the use of natural sweeteners like maple syrup and honey ensures that this dessert is free from refined sugars, making it a healthier option for those looking to satisfy their sweet tooth without the guilt.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use frozen blackberries instead of fresh ones?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blackberries if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw them completely and drain any excess liquid before using them in the recipe.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I substitute almond flour with another gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you have a nut allergy or prefer a different flour, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or rice flour. Keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>3. How long can I store the Gluten-Free Blackberry Tart?</h3>
        <p>The tart can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container to maintain its freshness.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make this tart vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this tart vegan by substituting the honey with agave syrup or another vegan sweetener. Ensure that all other ingredients, including the crust, are vegan-friendly.</p>
