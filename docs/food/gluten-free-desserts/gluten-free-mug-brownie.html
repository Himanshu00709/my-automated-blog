    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Mug Brownies</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I make a vegan version of this mug brownie?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Simply replace the milk with a non-dairy alternative like almond or oat milk, and use a plant-based oil instead of butter. You can also use a sugar substitute like maple syrup or agave.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I bake this in the oven instead of the microwave?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and bake the brownie in an oven-safe ramekin or mug for about 10-12 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.</p>

        <h3>3. How do I store leftover mug brownie?</h3>
        <p>Mug brownies are best enjoyed fresh, but if you have leftovers, cover the mug with plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat in the microwave for 20-30 seconds before serving.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I double the recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can double the ingredients to make a larger portion. Just ensure you use a larger mug or divide the batter into two mugs to prevent overflow.</p>
