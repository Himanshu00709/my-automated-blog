    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine almond flour, gluten-free flour blend, almond paste, eggs, butter, and sugar. Mix until the batter is smooth and well-combined. Divide the batter into three equal portions and add red food coloring to one portion and green food coloring to another. Leave the third portion uncolored to represent the white layer.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Bake the Layers</h3>
    <p>Line three separate baking pans with parchment paper and spread each colored batter evenly into its respective pan. Bake each layer for about 10-12 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the layers to cool completely before assembling.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Once the layers have cooled, spread a thin layer of apricot jam on top of the red layer and place the white layer on top. Repeat the process with the green layer. Press the layers together gently but firmly to ensure they stick. Wrap the assembled layers in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours to set.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Coat with Chocolate</h3>
    <p>After the layers have set, melt dark chocolate in a double boiler or microwave. Spread a thin layer of melted chocolate over the top of the green layer and allow it to set. Once the chocolate has hardened, flip the cookie stack and coat the bottom (red layer) with chocolate. Allow the chocolate to set completely before cutting the cookies into small rectangles or squares.</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use other types of jam?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other types of jam such as raspberry or strawberry if you prefer. However, apricot jam is traditional and pairs well with the almond flavor of the cookies.</p>
