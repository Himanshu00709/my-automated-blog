<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>
<p>Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, cream together the almond paste, butter, and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the almond extract. Gradually add the gluten-free flour blend, mixing until just combined.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Divide and Color the Batter</h3>
<p>Divide the batter evenly into three separate bowls. Add red food coloring to one bowl and green food coloring to another, leaving the third bowl plain (this will be the white layer). Mix each bowl until the colors are evenly distributed.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Bake the Layers</h3>
<p>Line three 9x9-inch baking pans with parchment paper and lightly grease them. Spread each colored batter into its own pan, smoothing the tops with a spatula. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the layers are set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the layers to cool completely.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Assemble the Cookies</h3>
<p>Once the layers are cool, spread a thin layer of apricot or raspberry jam on top of the green layer. Carefully place the white layer on top, then spread another layer of jam on top of the white layer. Finally, place the red layer on top. Cover the stacked layers with plastic wrap and place a heavy object (like a cutting board) on top to compress the layers. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Coat with Chocolate</h3>
<p>After chilling, trim the edges of the stacked layers to create neat, even sides. Cut the stack into small rectangular cookies. Melt the dark chocolate in a double boiler or microwave, then dip each cookie into the chocolate, coating the top and sides. Place the cookies on a wire rack to allow the chocolate to set.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Italian Rainbow Cookies</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> This ensures the cookies have the right texture and don’t crumble.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense cookies. Mix until just combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill the layers thoroughly:</strong> This makes it easier to cut the cookies and prevents them from falling apart.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Try using different jams or adding a hint of citrus zest to the batter for a unique twist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
    <p>While almond flour can be used, it may alter the texture of the cookies. A gluten-free flour blend is recommended for the best results.</p>

    <h3>How long do gluten-free Italian Rainbow Cookies last?</h3>
    <p>When stored in an airtight container, these cookies can last up to a week at room temperature or two weeks in the refrigerator.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze these cookies?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the cookies for up to three months. Make sure to wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe container.</p>

    <h3>Are these cookies suitable for people with nut allergies?</h3>
    <p>No, these cookies contain almond paste, which is not suitable for those with nut allergies. You can try substituting with a nut-free alternative, but the flavor and texture may differ.</p>
