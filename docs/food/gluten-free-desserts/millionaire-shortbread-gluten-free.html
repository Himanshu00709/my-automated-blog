    <h1>Millionaire Shortbread Gluten-Free: A Decadent Treat for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Millionaire shortbread, a classic British dessert, is a luxurious combination of a buttery shortbread base, a rich caramel layer, and a smooth chocolate topping. Traditionally, this treat is made with wheat flour, but with the rise of gluten-free diets, many are seeking alternatives that don't compromise on taste or texture. Enter gluten-free millionaire shortbread—a dessert that's just as indulgent and satisfying as the original, but accessible to those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals who experience gluten sensitivity or simply choose to avoid gluten for health reasons. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and other health problems for some people. By using gluten-free ingredients, you can enjoy the same delicious desserts without the adverse effects.</p>

    <h2>The Anatomy of Gluten-Free Millionaire Shortbread</h2>

    <p>Creating a gluten-free version of millionaire shortbread involves substituting traditional wheat flour with gluten-free alternatives. The key is to maintain the same texture and flavor that make this dessert so irresistible. Here's a breakdown of the three essential layers:</p>

    <h3>1. The Shortbread Base</h3>

    <p>The shortbread base is the foundation of the dessert. Traditionally, it's made with butter, sugar, and wheat flour. For a gluten-free version, you can use a blend of gluten-free flours such as almond flour, rice flour, or a pre-mixed gluten-free flour blend. The goal is to achieve a crumbly, buttery texture that holds together well.</p>

    <h3>2. The Caramel Layer</h3>

    <p>The caramel layer is the heart of the millionaire shortbread. It's made by heating sugar, butter, and condensed milk until it reaches a thick, gooey consistency. This layer is naturally gluten-free, so no substitutions are needed. However, it's essential to ensure that all ingredients used are certified gluten-free to avoid cross-contamination.</p>

    <h3>3. The Chocolate Topping</h3>

    <p>The final layer is a smooth, glossy chocolate topping. While chocolate is naturally gluten-free, it's crucial to check the label for any additives or cross-contamination risks. Dark chocolate is often the safest choice, but milk or white chocolate can also be used if they are certified gluten-free.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Shortbread Base:</strong> Preheat your oven to 160°C (325°F). Mix the gluten-free flour, cold butter, and caster sugar in a bowl until it resembles breadcrumbs. Press the mixture into a lined baking tin and bake for 20-25 minutes until golden. Allow to cool.</li>
