    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Crust</h3>

    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 325°F (163°C). In a medium-sized bowl, combine the crushed gluten-free graham crackers with the melted butter. Mix until the crumbs are evenly coated. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, ensuring an even layer. Bake the crust for about 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Cheesecake Filling</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until it’s smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar, sour cream, and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, beating just until each egg is incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense cheesecake. Pour the filling over the cooled crust and smooth the top with a spatula.</p>

    <h3>3. Baking the Cheesecake</h3>

    <p>Place the springform pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 50-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door slightly ajar for about an hour. This gradual cooling process helps prevent cracks from forming on the surface of the cheesecake.</p>

    <h3>4. Preparing the Blueberry Topping</h3>

    <p>While the cheesecake is cooling, prepare the blueberry topping. In a small saucepan, combine the fresh blueberries, lemon juice, and cornstarch. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the blueberries release their juices and the mixture thickens. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly before spreading it over the cooled cheesecake.</p>

    <h3>5. Chilling and Serving</h3>

    <p>Once the cheesecake and topping have cooled, cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. This allows the flavors to meld and the cheesecake to set completely. When ready to serve, carefully remove the springform pan’s sides, slice, and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Blueberry Cheesecake</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries if fresh ones are not available. Just be sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in the topping.</p>

        <h3>2. How long does gluten-free blueberry cheesecake last in the fridge?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free blueberry cheesecake can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Make sure to keep it covered to prevent it from absorbing other odors.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this cheesecake dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the cream cheese and sour cream with dairy-free alternatives, such as almond or coconut-based products. However, the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>4. Is this recipe suitable for people with celiac disease?</h3>
        <p>Yes, as long as you use certified gluten-free graham crackers and ensure all other ingredients are gluten-free, this recipe is safe for those with celiac disease.</p>
