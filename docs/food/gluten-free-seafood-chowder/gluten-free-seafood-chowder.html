    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Start by peeling and deveining the shrimp, and cutting the cod or haddock into bite-sized pieces. Dice the potatoes, chop the onion and celery, and mince the garlic. Having all your ingredients prepped and ready will make the cooking process smoother.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, celery, and garlic, and sauté until the vegetables are softened and fragrant, about 5 minutes. This forms the flavor base of your chowder.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Potatoes and Stock</h3>
    <p>Add the diced potatoes to the pot and pour in the gluten-free chicken or seafood stock. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 10-15 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Thicken the Chowder</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with a few tablespoons of cold water to create a slurry. Slowly stir the slurry into the chowder, allowing it to thicken. This step ensures your chowder has the perfect creamy consistency without the need for gluten-containing thickeners.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Seafood and Coconut Milk</h3>
    <p>Gently add the shrimp, scallops, and cod or haddock to the pot. Pour in the coconut milk and stir to combine. Let the chowder simmer for another 5-7 minutes, or until the seafood is cooked through and opaque.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Season and Serve</h3>
    <p>Season the chowder with salt and pepper to taste. Ladle the chowder into bowls and garnish with freshly chopped parsley. Serve hot with gluten-free crackers or crusty bread for a complete meal.</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen seafood for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen seafood, but make sure to thaw it completely before adding it to the chowder. This ensures even cooking and prevents the chowder from becoming watery.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What can I use instead of coconut milk?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use coconut milk, you can substitute it with another gluten-free milk alternative like almond milk or cashew milk. However, keep in mind that this may alter the flavor and creaminess of the chowder.</p>
    </div>
