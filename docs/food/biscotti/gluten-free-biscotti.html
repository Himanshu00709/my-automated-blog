    <h1>Gluten-Free Biscotti: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>Biscotti, the classic Italian twice-baked cookie, has been a beloved treat for centuries. Traditionally made with wheat flour, biscotti are known for their crunchy texture and versatility, often paired with coffee or tea. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this delightful treat can be challenging. Enter gluten-free biscotti—a delicious and healthy alternative that allows everyone to savor this timeless snack. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free biscotti, from their benefits to recipes and tips for baking the perfect batch.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Gluten-Free Biscotti Special?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free biscotti are made without wheat, barley, or rye, which are the primary sources of gluten. Instead, they use alternative flours such as almond flour, rice flour, or oat flour. These flours not only make the biscotti safe for those with gluten intolerance but also add unique flavors and textures. For example, almond flour lends a nutty richness, while rice flour provides a light and airy crumb. Additionally, gluten-free biscotti often incorporate wholesome ingredients like nuts, seeds, and dried fruits, making them a nutritious snack option.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Biscotti</h2>

    <p>Switching to gluten-free biscotti offers several benefits, especially for those with dietary restrictions. Here are some key advantages:</p>

    <h2>How to Bake Perfect Gluten-Free Biscotti</h2>

    <p>Baking gluten-free biscotti requires a slightly different approach than traditional recipes. Here are some tips to ensure your biscotti turn out perfectly:</p>

    <h3>1. Choose the Right Flour Blend</h3>
    <p>Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. A blend of flours often works best to mimic the texture of wheat flour. For example, combining almond flour with tapioca flour or rice flour can create a balanced texture.</p>

    <h3>2. Add Binders</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free dough lacks the elasticity of traditional dough, so adding binders like xanthan gum or psyllium husk can help hold the ingredients together.</p>

    <h3>3. Don’t Overmix the Dough</h3>
    <p>Overmixing can lead to dense and tough biscotti. Mix the ingredients just until combined to maintain a light and crumbly texture.</p>

    <h3>4. Slice Carefully After the First Bake</h3>
    <p>After the first bake, let the biscotti log cool slightly before slicing. Use a sharp serrated knife to ensure clean cuts without crumbling.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake Twice for Crunchiness</h3>
    <p>The hallmark of biscotti is their crunchy texture, achieved by baking them twice. After slicing, bake the pieces again at a lower temperature to dry them out.</p>
