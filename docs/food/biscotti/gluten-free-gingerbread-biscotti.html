    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Gingerbread Biscotti</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free gingerbread biscotti is a straightforward process, but it does require a bit of patience due to the double baking. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the molasses, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. If you're using nuts or dried fruit, fold them in at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Dough</h3>
    <p>Divide the dough in half and shape each portion into a log about 12 inches long and 2 inches wide. Place the logs on the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between them.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: First Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the logs for 25-30 minutes, or until they are firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and let them cool for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F (160°C).</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Slice and Second Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a serrated knife, slice the logs diagonally into 1/2-inch thick slices. Place the slices cut-side down on the baking sheet and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the biscotti are crisp and golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the biscotti to cool completely on a wire rack before serving. Store in an airtight container for up to two weeks.</p>
