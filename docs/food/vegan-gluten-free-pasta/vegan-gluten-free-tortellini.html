    <h1>Vegan Gluten-Free Tortellini: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for plant-based and gluten-free foods has skyrocketed.

The filling is entirely plant-based, often featuring ingredients like tofu, cashew cheese, spinach, or mushrooms. The result is a dish that’s not only delicious but also suitable for those with gluten intolerance, celiac disease, or a vegan lifestyle.</p>
