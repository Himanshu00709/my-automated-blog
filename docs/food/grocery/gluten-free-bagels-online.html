    <h1>Gluten-Free Bagels Online: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and for good reason. With more people being diagnosed with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or simply choosing to adopt a gluten-free lifestyle, the market has responded with a variety of options. Among these, gluten-free bagels have become a popular choice for those who miss the chewy, satisfying texture of traditional bagels but need to avoid gluten. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free bagels available online, from their nutritional benefits to where you can buy them.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Bagels?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free bagels are not just for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. They can be a healthier option for anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and while it’s harmless for most people, it can cause serious health issues for those with gluten-related disorders. Gluten-free bagels are made with alternative flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or rice flour, which not only make them safe for those with gluten intolerance but also add unique flavors and textures.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free bagels often contain fewer calories and carbohydrates than their traditional counterparts, making them a great option for those on a low-carb or ketogenic diet. They are also often enriched with additional nutrients, such as fiber and protein, to compensate for the lack of gluten.</p>

    <h2>Top Gluten-Free Bagel Brands Available Online</h2>
