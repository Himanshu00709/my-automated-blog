    <p>From a nutritional standpoint, Pillsbury Gluten-Free Pie Dough is relatively similar to traditional pie dough. It contains a moderate amount of fat and calories, making it a treat best enjoyed in moderation. However, it is free from gluten, making it a safe option for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h2>How to Use Pillsbury Gluten-Free Pie Dough</h2>

    <p>Using Pillsbury Gluten-Free Pie Dough is straightforward, but there are a few tips and tricks to ensure the best results. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Thaw the Dough:</strong> If the dough is frozen, allow it to thaw in the refrigerator for a few hours before use. This ensures that it rolls out smoothly without cracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll It Out:</strong> Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap to prevent sticking. Roll it out to your desired thickness, typically about 1/8 inch for most pies.</li>
        <li><strong>Transfer to Pie Dish:</strong> Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough to your pie dish. If it tears, don’t worry—gluten-free dough is more forgiving and can be patched together easily.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Bake if Needed:</strong> For recipes that require a pre-baked crust, such as custard pies, bake the crust at 375°F for about 10-12 minutes before adding the filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Your Filling:</strong> Once your crust is ready, add your favorite filling and bake according to your recipe’s instructions.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pie Crusts</h2>

    <p>While Pillsbury Gluten-Free Pie Dough is designed to be easy to use, here are some additional tips to ensure your pie crust turns out perfectly:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep It Cold:</strong> Gluten-free dough can become sticky if it gets too warm. Work quickly and keep the dough cold until you’re ready to use it.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Parchment Paper:</strong> Rolling the dough between parchment paper prevents it from sticking to your rolling pin and countertop.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overwork the Dough:</strong> Overworking gluten-free dough can make it tough. Handle it as little as possible to maintain its flaky texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Patch Tears Gently:</strong> If the dough tears while transferring it to the pie dish, gently press it back together. Gluten-free dough is more forgiving than traditional dough.</li>
    </ul>
