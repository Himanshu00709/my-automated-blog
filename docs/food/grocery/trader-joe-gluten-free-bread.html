    <li><strong>Potato Starch:</strong> Another starch that contributes to the bread's moisture and softness.</li>
    <li><strong>Egg Whites:</strong> Used to add structure and stability to the bread, egg whites also contribute to its protein content.</li>
    <li><strong>Xanthan Gum:</strong> A common gluten-free binder that helps to hold the bread together and prevent it from crumbling.</li>
