    <h1>Are Great Value White Corn Tortillas Gluten-Free?</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. For those who must avoid gluten, finding safe and delicious food options is crucial. One common question that arises is whether Great Value White Corn Tortillas are gluten-free. This article will delve into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and certifications to provide a comprehensive answer.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it's essential to identify products that are truly gluten-free.</p>

    <p>Corn, by nature, is gluten-free. However, the processing and manufacturing of corn-based products can sometimes introduce gluten through cross-contamination. This is why it's important to scrutinize not just the ingredients but also the production practices of the brand in question.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Great Value White Corn Tortillas</h2>

    <p>Great Value White Corn Tortillas are made from a simple list of ingredients:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>White corn masa flour</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Cellulose gum</li>
        <li>Propionic acid</li>
        <li>Benzoic acid</li>
        <li>Phosphoric acid</li>
        <li>Guar gum</li>
        <li>Enzymes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>None of these ingredients contain gluten. However, the absence of gluten-containing ingredients does not automatically guarantee that the product is gluten-free. Cross-contamination during manufacturing is a potential concern.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Great Value is Walmart's private label brand, and their products are manufactured in facilities that may also process gluten-containing products. Cross-contamination can occur if the same equipment is used for both gluten-free and gluten-containing products without proper cleaning in between.</p>

    <p>To determine whether Great Value White Corn Tortillas are safe for those with gluten sensitivities, it's important to look for any gluten-free certifications or statements on the packaging. Unfortunately, as of the latest information available, Great Value White Corn Tortillas do not carry a gluten-free certification.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Certification and Labeling</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free certification is provided by various organizations, such as the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO) and the Celiac Support Association (CSA). These certifications require that products meet strict standards, including testing for gluten levels below 20 parts per million (ppm), which is considered safe for most people with celiac disease.</p>

    <p>While Great Value White Corn Tortillas do not have a gluten-free certification, they are labeled as "Made with 100% White Corn." This suggests that the primary ingredient is corn, which is naturally gluten-free. However, without a certification, there is no guarantee that the product is free from cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Information</h2>

    <p>For those who are not only concerned about gluten but also about the nutritional content of their food, here is a breakdown of the nutritional information for Great Value White Corn Tortillas:</p>
