    <h1>Gluten-Free Kix: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.

    <p>Gluten-Free Kix is made with whole grain corn and is free from wheat, barley, and rye, which are the primary sources of gluten. This makes it a safe option for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. The cereal retains the same light, crispy texture and slightly sweet flavor that made the original Kix so popular.</p>
