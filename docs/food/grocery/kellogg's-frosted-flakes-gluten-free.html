    <p>For many, breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and cereal often plays a starring role. Kellogg's Frosted Flakes has been a beloved breakfast staple for decades, known for its sweet, crunchy flakes and iconic Tony the Tiger mascot. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic cereal has been a challenge.
