    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Pitas at Home</h2>

    <p>If you're feeling adventurous, making gluten-free pitas at home can be a rewarding experience. Not only do you have complete control over the ingredients, but you can also customize the flavor and texture to your liking. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups gluten-free flour blend (e.g., almond flour, chickpea flour)</li>
        <li>1 tsp xanthan gum (if not included in your flour blend)</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the warm water and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 6 equal portions and roll each portion into a ball.</li>
        <li>Roll out each ball into a circle about ¼ inch thick.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each pita for about 2-3 minutes on each side, until it puffs up and develops golden brown spots.</li>
        <li>Serve warm or store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Making gluten-free pitas at home allows you to experiment with different flours and flavors. For example, you can add herbs like rosemary or thyme to the dough for an extra burst of flavor. You can also try using different types of gluten-free flours, such as buckwheat or quinoa flour, to create unique textures and tastes.</p>
