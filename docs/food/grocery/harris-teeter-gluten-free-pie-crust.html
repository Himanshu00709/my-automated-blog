    <h2>How to Use Harris Teeter Gluten-Free Pie Crust</h2>

    <p>Using Harris Teeter's gluten-free pie crust is straightforward, even for those who are new to gluten-free baking. Here are some tips to help you get the most out of this product:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Thawing:</strong> If the crust is frozen, allow it to thaw in the refrigerator for a few hours before use. This will make it easier to handle and shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Rolling:</strong> The crust comes pre-rolled, but if you need to adjust its size or shape, lightly dust your work surface with gluten-free flour to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Filling:</strong> Whether you're making a sweet or savory pie, ensure that your filling is prepared and ready to go before you start working with the crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking:</strong> Follow the baking instructions provided on the packaging, but keep an eye on the crust as it bakes. Gluten-free products can sometimes brown more quickly than their gluten-containing counterparts.</li>
