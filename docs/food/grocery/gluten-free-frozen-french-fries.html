<h1>Gluten-Free Frozen French Fries: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<h2>How to Make Your Own Gluten-Free Frozen French Fries</h2>

<p>If you prefer to make your own gluten-free frozen French fries at home, it’s easier than you might think. Here’s a simple recipe:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Choose the Right Potatoes:</strong> Russet potatoes are the best choice for French fries because of their high starch content, which helps achieve a crispy texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Cut the Potatoes:</strong> Cut the potatoes into even strips, about 1/4 inch thick. This ensures that they cook evenly.</li>
    <li><strong>Soak the Potatoes:</strong> Soak the cut potatoes in cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch. This helps prevent the fries from sticking together and ensures a crispier result.</li>
    <li><strong>Dry the Potatoes:</strong> After soaking, pat the potatoes dry with a clean towel to remove any excess moisture.</li>
    <li><strong>Blanch the Potatoes:</strong> Blanch the potatoes in hot oil (around 325°F) for about 3-4 minutes. This pre-cooks the fries and helps them achieve a golden color when fried again.</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze the Potatoes:</strong> After blanching, let the fries cool completely, then spread them out on a baking sheet and freeze them for at least 2 hours. Once frozen, transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the Fries:</strong> When you’re ready to eat, fry the frozen fries in hot oil (around 375°F) for 3-5 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Alternatively, you can bake them in the oven at 425°F for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li>
</ol>
