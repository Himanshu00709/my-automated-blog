<p>As you can see, the dough is relatively low in calories and fat, making it a suitable option for those who are mindful of their caloric intake.

<h2>How to Use Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Pizza Dough</h2>

<p>Using Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Pizza Dough is straightforward, but there are a few tips and tricks to ensure you get the best results. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Thaw the Dough:</strong> If the dough is frozen, allow it to thaw in the refrigerator overnight. This will make it easier to work with.</li>
    <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats to ensure it gets nice and hot.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare Your Surface:</strong> Lightly flour your work surface with gluten-free flour to prevent the dough from sticking. You can also use parchment paper for easier handling.</li>
    <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Gently roll out the dough to your desired thickness. Keep in mind that gluten-free dough can be a bit more delicate than traditional dough, so handle it with care.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Your Toppings:</strong> Spread your favorite sauce, cheese, and toppings over the dough. Be creative! The possibilities are endless.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Transfer the pizza to your preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Creative Recipe Ideas</h2>

<p>While pizza is the obvious choice, Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Pizza Dough can be used in a variety of other dishes. Here are a few creative ideas to get you started:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Flatbreads:</strong> Roll out the dough thinly, brush it with olive oil, and sprinkle with herbs and spices. Bake until crispy and serve with dips like hummus or tzatziki.</li>
    <li><strong>Calzones:</strong> Fill the dough with your favorite ingredients, fold it over, and seal the edges. Bake until golden brown for a delicious handheld meal.</li>
    <li><strong>Sweet Treats:</strong> Roll out the dough, spread it with butter, cinnamon, and sugar, then roll it up and slice into cinnamon rolls. Bake and top with a simple glaze for a gluten-free dessert.</li>
</ul>
