<h2>Nutritional Considerations</h2>

<p>When choosing gluten-free bread, it's important to consider the nutritional content. Gluten-free breads can sometimes be lower in fiber and higher in sugar and fat compared to their gluten-containing counterparts. However, Trader Joe's offers options that are fortified with additional nutrients to help bridge this gap. For example, their Gluten-Free Whole Grain Bread is a good source of fiber and protein, making it a more balanced choice for those looking to maintain a healthy diet.</p>

<h2>How to Store Gluten-Free Bread</h2>

<p>Gluten-free bread tends to have a shorter shelf life than traditional bread due to the absence of preservatives. To keep your gluten-free bread fresh, it's best to store it in the refrigerator or freezer. If you plan to consume it within a few days, refrigeration is sufficient. For longer storage, freezing is recommended. When you're ready to eat, simply toast the bread straight from the freezer for a quick and easy meal.</p>
