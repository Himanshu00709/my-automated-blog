<h1>Gluten-Free French Fried Onions: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>French fried onions are a beloved topping for green bean casseroles, salads, and various other dishes. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free version can be a challenge. Fortunately, several brands have stepped up to offer gluten-free French fried onions that are just as crispy and flavorful as their traditional counterparts. In this article, we’ll explore the best gluten-free French fried onion brands, their ingredients, and how to use them in your favorite recipes.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free French Fried Onions?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health problems. French fried onions are typically made with wheat flour, which means they are off-limits for those on a gluten-free diet. However, gluten-free French fried onions are made with alternative flours, such as rice flour or cornstarch, making them safe for consumption by those with gluten-related disorders.</p>
