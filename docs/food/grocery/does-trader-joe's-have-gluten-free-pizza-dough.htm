These flours provide a similar texture and taste to traditional pizza dough while being safe for those with gluten intolerances. The key to a good gluten-free pizza dough is achieving the right balance of elasticity and flavor, which can be tricky without gluten.</p>

    <h2>How to Use Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Pizza Dough</h2>

    <p>Using Trader Joe's gluten-free pizza dough is straightforward, but there are a few tips to ensure the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature:</strong> Before rolling out the dough, let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. This makes it easier to handle and shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Parchment Paper:</strong> Gluten-free dough can be sticky, so rolling it out on parchment paper will prevent it from sticking to your work surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Bake the Crust:</strong> For a crispier crust, pre-bake the dough for 5-7 minutes before adding toppings. This helps to set the structure and prevents a soggy crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Your Favorite Toppings:</strong> Once the crust is pre-baked, add your favorite sauce, cheese, and toppings. Be creative and experiment with different combinations!</li>
        <li><strong>Bake Until Golden Brown:</strong> Bake the pizza according to the package instructions, usually at 425°F for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
