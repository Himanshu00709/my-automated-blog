    <h2>How to Use Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Pizza Dough</h2>

    <p>Using Trader Joe's gluten-free pizza dough is straightforward, but there are a few tips to ensure the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature:</strong> Before working with the dough, let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. This will make it easier to stretch and shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Parchment Paper:</strong> Gluten-free dough can be sticky, so using parchment paper or a silicone baking mat will prevent it from sticking to your work surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Bake the Crust:</strong> To avoid a soggy crust, pre-bake the dough for 5-7 minutes before adding your toppings. This will help the crust hold up better during the final baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> Gluten-free pizza dough pairs well with a variety of toppings. Consider using fresh vegetables, high-quality cheeses, and lean proteins to create a balanced and flavorful pizza.</li>
