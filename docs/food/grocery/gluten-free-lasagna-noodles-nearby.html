    <h2>How to Choose the Best Gluten-Free Lasagna Noodles</h2>

    <p>Not all gluten-free lasagna noodles are created equal. Here are some factors to consider when choosing the best option for your needs:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Look for noodles made from whole grains like brown rice or quinoa for added nutritional benefits.</li>
        <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Some gluten-free noodles can become mushy when cooked. Read reviews or try a few brands to find one that holds up well during baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Certification:</strong> Ensure the product is certified gluten-free to avoid cross-contamination risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> Some gluten-free noodles have a neutral flavor, while others may have a distinct taste. Choose one that complements your lasagna recipe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for Making the Perfect Gluten-Free Lasagna</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free lasagna is similar to making traditional lasagna, but there are a few tips to keep in mind to ensure success:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Noodles Al Dente:</strong> Gluten-free noodles can become overly soft if overcooked. Cook them slightly underdone (al dente) so they hold their shape during baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer Generously:</strong> Gluten-free noodles may absorb more sauce, so be sure to layer your lasagna with plenty of sauce and cheese to keep it moist.</li>
        <li><strong>Let It Rest:</strong> Allow your lasagna to rest for 10-15 minutes after baking. This helps the layers set and makes it easier to slice.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free lasagna is a great opportunity to get creative with ingredients. Try adding roasted vegetables, spinach, or a variety of cheeses for a unique twist.</li>
    </ol>
