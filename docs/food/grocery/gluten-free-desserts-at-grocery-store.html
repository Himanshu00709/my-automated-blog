However, even those without gluten-related health concerns are increasingly opting for gluten-free options due to perceived health benefits. Gluten-free desserts are often made with alternative flours like almond, coconut, or rice flour, which can offer different nutritional profiles and flavors compared to traditional wheat-based desserts.</p>

    <p>From decadent chocolate cakes to light and fluffy vanilla cupcakes, gluten-free cake options are abundant. Many stores now carry pre-packaged gluten-free cake mixes, allowing you to bake your own at home.</p>

    <h3>3. Gluten-Free Brownies</h3>

    <p>Brownies are a favorite among dessert lovers, and gluten-free versions are just as rich and fudgy. Look for brownies made with almond flour or other gluten-free flours for a delicious treat.</p>

    <h3>4. Gluten-Free Ice Cream and Frozen Desserts</h3>

    <h3>5. Gluten-Free Pies and Tarts</h3>

    <p>Pies and tarts can be made gluten-free by using alternative crusts, such as those made from nuts or gluten-free flour blends. Look for fruit pies, custard tarts, and even savory options like quiches.</p>
