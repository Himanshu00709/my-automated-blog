    <h1>Gluten-Free Bread Market Basket: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has surged, driven by an increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders and a growing preference for healthier dietary options.

This blog post delves into the gluten-free bread market basket, exploring its key components, nutritional benefits, and how to make informed choices when shopping for gluten-free bread.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Bread</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free bread is specifically designed for individuals who cannot tolerate gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For those with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergies, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues. Gluten-free bread is made using alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, coconut flour, or a blend of gluten-free grains. These breads are crafted to mimic the texture and taste of traditional bread while being safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Key Ingredients in Gluten-Free Bread</h2>

    <p>The ingredients used in gluten-free bread vary widely depending on the brand and recipe. However, some common ingredients include:</p>

            <td>Rice Flour</td>
