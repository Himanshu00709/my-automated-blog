    <h1>Gluten-Free Saltine Crackers: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Saltine crackers have been a staple in pantries for generations, known for their crisp texture and versatility. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, traditional saltines are off the table due to their gluten content. Enter gluten-free saltine crackers—a game-changer for those who need to avoid gluten but still crave the classic crunch. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free saltine crackers, from their ingredients and nutritional benefits to how they compare to traditional saltines.</p>

Gluten-free saltines are made using alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca starch, which provide a similar texture and taste without the gluten.</p>

    <p>These crackers are often fortified with additional nutrients to compensate for the lack of gluten, making them a healthier option for many. They are perfect for snacking, pairing with soups, or even using as a base for appetizers.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Gluten-Free Saltine Crackers</h2>

    <p>The ingredients in gluten-free saltine crackers can vary depending on the brand, but they typically include a blend of gluten-free flours, starches, and binding agents. Here’s a breakdown of common ingredients:</p>
