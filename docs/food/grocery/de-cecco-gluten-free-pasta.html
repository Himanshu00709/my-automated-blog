    <h2>Cooking Tips for De Cecco Gluten-Free Pasta</h2>

    <p>While De Cecco’s gluten-free pasta is designed to mimic the texture of traditional wheat pasta, there are a few tips to ensure the best results when cooking:</p>

        <li><strong>Stir frequently:</strong> To prevent sticking, stir the pasta occasionally during cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow the cooking time:</strong> Overcooking gluten-free pasta can make it mushy. Stick to the recommended cooking time on the package, usually around 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with caution:</strong> Unlike traditional pasta, gluten-free pasta benefits from a quick rinse after draining to remove excess starch, which can improve its texture.</li>
