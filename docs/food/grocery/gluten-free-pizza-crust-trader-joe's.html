    <h2>How to Make the Perfect Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>

    <p>Making a delicious gluten-free pizza at home is easier than you might think. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create a pizza that rivals your favorite pizzeria:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). This ensures that your pizza crust will cook evenly and develop a nice, crispy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Crust:</strong> Remove the gluten-free pizza crust from its packaging and place it on a baking sheet or pizza stone. If you prefer a thinner crust, you can roll it out slightly with a rolling pin.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Your Sauce:</strong> Spread a thin layer of your favorite pizza sauce over the crust. Be careful not to overload it, as too much sauce can make the crust soggy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Sprinkle your desired toppings evenly over the sauce. Whether you prefer classic pepperoni, fresh vegetables, or a mix of cheeses, the choice is yours.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve. Enjoy your homemade gluten-free pizza!</li>
    </ol>
