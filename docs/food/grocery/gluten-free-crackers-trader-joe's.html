    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, and for good reason.

Additionally, gluten-free crackers often contain alternative grains and seeds that are rich in nutrients, making them a nutritious snack option.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Crackers</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free crackers are often made with alternative grains like rice, quinoa, and oats, which can offer a range of nutritional benefits.

Quinoa is a complete protein, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids, making it an excellent choice for vegetarians and vegans. Flaxseeds and sunflower seeds are rich in healthy fats, particularly omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial for heart health.</p>

    <p>Additionally, many gluten-free crackers are lower in calories and fat compared to their gluten-containing counterparts, making them a great option for those looking to manage their weight. However, it's important to read the labels carefully, as some gluten-free products may contain added sugars or unhealthy fats to enhance flavor.</p>
