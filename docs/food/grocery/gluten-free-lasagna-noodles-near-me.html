<ol>
    <li><strong>Pre-Cook the Noodles:</strong> Some gluten-free lasagna noodles require pre-cooking before assembling the lasagna. Be sure to check the package instructions and cook the noodles al dente to prevent them from becoming too soft during baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Layer Carefully:</strong> Gluten-free noodles can be more delicate than traditional noodles, so handle them gently when layering. Spread a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of the baking dish to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Plenty of Sauce:</strong> Gluten-free noodles tend to absorb more liquid than traditional noodles, so be generous with your sauce to keep the lasagna moist and flavorful.</li>
    <li><strong>Let It Rest:</strong> After baking, let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to serve.</li>
