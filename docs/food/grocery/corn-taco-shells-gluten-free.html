<h1>Corn Taco Shells: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Among the many gluten-free options available, corn taco shells have emerged as a popular choice for those seeking a delicious and safe alternative to traditional wheat-based taco shells. In this article, we will explore the benefits of corn taco shells, their nutritional profile, and how they can be incorporated into a gluten-free diet.</p>

<h2>What Makes Corn Taco Shells Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Corn taco shells are naturally gluten-free because they are made from corn masa, a type of dough prepared from ground corn. Unlike wheat, which contains gluten, corn is a gluten-free grain. This makes corn taco shells an excellent option for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it's important to note that not all corn taco shells are created equal. Some brands may add gluten-containing ingredients or process their products in facilities that also handle wheat, leading to cross-contamination. Therefore, it's crucial to read labels carefully and choose certified gluten-free products.</p>
