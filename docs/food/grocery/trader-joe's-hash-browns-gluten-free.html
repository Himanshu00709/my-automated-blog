    <h2>How to Cook Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Hash Browns</h2>

    <p>One of the best things about Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Hash Browns is their versatility. They can be cooked in a variety of ways to suit your taste preferences. Here are some popular methods:</p>

    <h3>1. Pan-Frying</h3>
    <p>Pan-frying is the most common method for cooking hash browns. Simply heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat, add a small amount of oil or butter, and cook the hash brown patties for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden brown and crispy.</p>

    <h3>2. Baking</h3>
    <p>For a healthier option, you can bake the hash browns in the oven. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C), place the hash browns on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and bake for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through.</p>

    <h3>3. Air Frying</h3>
    <p>Air frying is another excellent method for achieving a crispy texture without the need for excess oil. Preheat your air fryer to 375°F (190°C), place the hash browns in the basket, and cook for 10-12 minutes, flipping halfway through.</p>
