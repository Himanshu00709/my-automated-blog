    </table>

    <p>As seen in the table, these bagels are relatively high in carbohydrates, which is typical for gluten-free products that rely on starchy flours. However, they are low in fat and contain no cholesterol, making them a heart-healthy option. The sodium content is moderate, so those monitoring their salt intake should be mindful of this.</p>

    <h2>Taste and Texture</h2>

    <p>One of the most critical aspects of any gluten-free product is how well it replicates the taste and texture of its gluten-containing counterpart. Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Everything Bagels do an admirable job in this regard. The bagels have a slightly denser texture compared to traditional bagels, but they are still soft and chewy, which is a significant achievement in gluten-free baking.</p>

    <p>The "everything" seasoning is generously applied, providing a robust flavor that is both savory and slightly tangy. The combination of sesame seeds, poppy seeds, garlic, and onion creates a complex flavor profile that is satisfying on its own or when paired with your favorite spreads. Whether toasted or enjoyed as is, these bagels offer a delightful eating experience.</p>

    <h2>How Do They Compare to Traditional Bagels?</h2>

    <p>When comparing Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Everything Bagels to traditional bagels, there are a few key differences to note. Traditional bagels are typically made with wheat flour, which gives them a lighter and airier texture. Gluten-free bagels, on the other hand, tend to be denser due to the absence of gluten, which provides elasticity and structure.</p>

    <p>However, Trader Joe's has managed to create a product that comes remarkably close to the real thing. The chewiness and flavor are on par with traditional bagels, making them a suitable alternative for those who cannot consume gluten. Additionally, the nutritional profiles are similar, with both types of bagels being relatively high in carbohydrates and low in fat.</p>
