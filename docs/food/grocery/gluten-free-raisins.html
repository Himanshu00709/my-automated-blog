    <h1>Gluten-Free Raisins: A Healthy Snack for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Raisins are a popular snack enjoyed by people of all ages. They are not only delicious but also packed with essential nutrients.

    <p>As you can see, raisins are a rich source of essential vitamins and minerals. They are particularly high in iron and potassium, which are important for maintaining healthy blood and heart function. Additionally, the antioxidants in raisins help protect your cells from damage caused by free radicals.</p>

    <h2>How Are Gluten-Free Raisins Produced?</h2>

    <p>The production of gluten-free raisins involves several steps to ensure that they remain free from gluten contamination. Here’s a brief overview of the process:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Harvesting:</strong> Grapes are harvested when they are fully ripe and ready for drying.</li>
        <li><strong>Drying:</strong> The grapes are dried either naturally in the sun or using mechanical dryers. This process removes most of the water content, leaving behind the concentrated nutrients and natural sugars.</li>

        <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> The raisins are packaged in a facility that follows strict gluten-free protocols to prevent cross-contamination.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>It’s important to note that not all raisins are gluten-free by default. Some brands may process their raisins in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products, which can lead to cross-contamination. Therefore, always look for raisins that are certified gluten-free if you have a gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>
