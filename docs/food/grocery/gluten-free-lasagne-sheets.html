<h2>How to Use Gluten-Free Lasagne Sheets</h2>

<p>Using gluten-free lasagne sheets is similar to using traditional lasagne sheets, but there are a few key differences to keep in mind to ensure the best results. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Choose the Right Sheets:</strong> Decide whether you want to use pre-cooked or uncooked gluten-free lasagne sheets. Pre-cooked sheets are more convenient, but uncooked sheets may offer a more authentic texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong> Whether you’re making a classic Bolognese, a creamy béchamel, or a vegetarian sauce, ensure your sauce is ready before assembling the lasagne.</li>
    <li><strong>Layer the Lasagne:</strong> Start with a thin layer of sauce at the bottom of your baking dish to prevent sticking. Add a layer of lasagne sheets, followed by more sauce, and repeat until the dish is full. Finish with a layer of sauce and a generous topping of cheese.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the lasagne with foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
    <li><strong>Rest Before Serving:</strong> Allow the lasagne to rest for 10-15 minutes after baking. This helps the layers set and makes it easier to cut and serve.</li>
</ol>
