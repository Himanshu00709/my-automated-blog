    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to the temperature specified on the package. This ensures even baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare Your Pan:</strong> Grease your cake pan or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Ingredients:</strong> Combine the cake mix with the required wet ingredients (usually eggs, oil, and water) in a large bowl. Mix until smooth, but avoid overmixing to keep the cake light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake according to the package instructions. Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center of the cake; it should come out clean.</li>
