    <h2>Tips for Baking with Aldi Gluten-Free Flour</h2>

    <p>Baking with gluten-free flour can be a bit different from using traditional wheat flour. Here are some tips to help you get the best results:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Measure Accurately:</strong> Gluten-free flours can be denser than wheat flour, so it's important to measure accurately. Use a kitchen scale if possible to ensure you're using the correct amount.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Binders:</strong> Since gluten-free flours lack the binding properties of gluten, you may need to add xanthan gum or psyllium husk to your recipes to help with texture and structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Ratios:</strong> If you're converting a traditional recipe to gluten-free, you may need to adjust the ratios of wet to dry ingredients. Gluten-free flours can absorb more liquid, so you might need to add a bit more moisture to your batter or dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense and tough baked goods. Mix your ingredients just until they are combined to avoid this issue.</li>
    </ul>
