    <h1>Gluten-Free Breadcrumbs at Tesco: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the growing popularity of gluten-free diets. Among the many gluten-free products available, gluten-free breadcrumbs have become a staple in many kitchens. Tesco, one of the UK's leading supermarkets, offers a variety of gluten-free breadcrumbs that cater to different dietary needs and preferences. In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free breadcrumbs at Tesco, including their benefits, varieties, and how to use them in your cooking.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Breadcrumbs?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free breadcrumbs are an excellent alternative for those who need to avoid gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Gluten-free breadcrumbs allow these individuals to enjoy their favorite breaded dishes without the risk of adverse health effects.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free breadcrumbs are not just for those with dietary restrictions. They can also be a healthier option for anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake or explore new culinary possibilities. Made from gluten-free grains like rice, corn, or quinoa, these breadcrumbs often have a lighter texture and can add a unique flavor profile to your dishes.</p>

    <h2>How to Use Gluten-Free Breadcrumbs in Your Cooking</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free breadcrumbs are incredibly versatile and can be used in a variety of dishes. Here are some creative ways to incorporate them into your meals:</p>

    <h3>1. Breaded Chicken or Fish</h3>
    <p>One of the most common uses for breadcrumbs is as a coating for chicken or fish. Simply dip your protein in beaten egg, then coat it with gluten-free breadcrumbs. Fry or bake until golden brown for a crispy, delicious meal.</p>

    <h3>2. Meatballs or Meatloaf</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free breadcrumbs can be used as a binder in meatballs or meatloaf. They help hold the mixture together while adding a subtle crunch. Mix the breadcrumbs with your choice of ground meat, seasonings, and eggs, then shape and cook as usual.</p>

    <h3>3. Topping for Casseroles</h3>
    <p>Add a crunchy topping to your casseroles by sprinkling gluten-free breadcrumbs over the dish before baking. This works particularly well with macaroni and cheese, vegetable bakes, or shepherd's pie.</p>

    <h3>4. Thickening Soups and Stews</h3>
    <p>If you need to thicken a soup or stew, gluten-free breadcrumbs can be a great alternative to flour. Simply stir them into the liquid and let them absorb the excess moisture, creating a thicker consistency.</p>
