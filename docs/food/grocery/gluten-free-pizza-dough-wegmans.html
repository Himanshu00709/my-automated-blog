<h2>How to Use Wegmans’ Gluten-Free Pizza Dough</h2>

<p>Using Wegmans’ gluten-free pizza dough is straightforward, but there are a few tips and tricks to ensure your pizza turns out perfectly. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Thaw the Dough:</strong> If the dough is frozen, allow it to thaw in the refrigerator overnight. This ensures even cooking and prevents the dough from becoming too sticky.</li>
    <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). A hot oven is crucial for achieving a crispy crust.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare Your Surface:</strong> Lightly dust your work surface with gluten-free flour to prevent sticking. Roll out the dough to your desired thickness.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Spread your favorite sauce, cheese, and toppings over the dough. Be mindful not to overload the pizza, as this can make it soggy.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Transfer the pizza to a preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
</ol>
