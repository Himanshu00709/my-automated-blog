It is versatile and can be used in a variety of dishes, from stir-fries to marinades, and even as a dipping sauce. The gluten-free formulation ensures that you can enjoy the same great taste without the worry of gluten-related health issues.</p>

<p>As you can see, Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Soy Sauce is low in calories and fat, making it a suitable option for those who are watching their calorie intake. However, it is important to note that the sodium content is relatively high, which is typical for soy sauce. Therefore, it should be consumed in moderation, especially by those who need to monitor their sodium intake.</p>

<h2>How Does It Compare to Traditional Soy Sauce?</h2>

However, the flavor profile is remarkably similar, with both versions offering that rich, savory umami taste that soy sauce is known for.</p>

<p>Another difference lies in the ingredient list. Traditional soy sauce often contains additional ingredients such as preservatives and flavor enhancers, which are not present in Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Soy Sauce. This makes the gluten-free version a cleaner, more natural option for those who prefer to avoid artificial additives.</p>

<p>In terms of nutritional content, both versions are relatively similar, with the main difference being the sodium content. Traditional soy sauce tends to have a slightly higher sodium content, but the difference is minimal.
