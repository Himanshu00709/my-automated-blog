    <h1>Heinz Gluten-Free Gravy: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>When it comes to comfort food, few things can rival the rich, savory taste of gravy. Whether it's drizzled over mashed potatoes, poured onto a roast dinner, or used as a dipping sauce, gravy is a staple in many households. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a safe and delicious gravy can be a challenge. Enter Heinz Gluten-Free Gravy—a product that promises to deliver all the flavor without the gluten. In this article, we'll take a deep dive into Heinz Gluten-Free Gravy, exploring its ingredients, nutritional profile, and how it compares to traditional gravies.</p>

    <h2>What is Heinz Gluten-Free Gravy?</h2>

    <p>Heinz Gluten-Free Gravy is a specially formulated gravy that is free from gluten, making it suitable for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. The gravy is made from a blend of natural ingredients, including cornflour, which is used as a thickening agent instead of wheat flour. This ensures that the gravy has the same rich, velvety texture as traditional gravies but without the gluten.</p>

    <p>Heinz offers a variety of gluten-free gravy options, including classic flavors like beef and chicken. These gravies are designed to be versatile, making them perfect for a wide range of dishes. Whether you're preparing a Sunday roast, a quick weeknight dinner, or a holiday feast, Heinz Gluten-Free Gravy can be a convenient and delicious addition to your meal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients and Nutritional Profile</h2>

    <p>One of the key aspects of Heinz Gluten-Free Gravy is its ingredient list. The company has gone to great lengths to ensure that the product is not only gluten-free but also free from artificial colors and flavors. Here's a breakdown of the main ingredients:</p>

    <table>

            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Cornflour</td>
                <td>Thickening agent</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vegetable Oils</td>
                <td>Adds richness and flavor</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>Enhances flavor</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Yeast Extract</td>

    <p>In terms of nutrition, Heinz Gluten-Free Gravy is relatively low in calories, making it a suitable option for those who are watching their calorie intake. A typical serving contains around 20-30 calories, depending on the flavor. The gravy is also low in fat and sugar, making it a healthier alternative to some traditional gravies that may contain higher levels of these nutrients.</p>

    <h2>How Does Heinz Gluten-Free Gravy Compare to Traditional Gravy?</h2>

    <p>When it comes to taste and texture, Heinz Gluten-Free Gravy holds its own against traditional gravies. The use of cornflour as a thickening agent gives the gravy a smooth, velvety texture that is comparable to gravies made with wheat flour. The flavor is rich and savory, with a depth that comes from the use of natural ingredients like yeast extract and onion powder.</p>

    <p>One of the main advantages of Heinz Gluten-Free Gravy is its convenience. Traditional gravies often require time-consuming preparation, including the making of a roux (a mixture of flour and fat) and the slow simmering of stock. Heinz Gluten-Free Gravy, on the other hand, can be prepared in a matter of minutes, making it a great option for busy households.</p>

    <p>Another point of comparison is the shelf life. Traditional gravies, especially those made from scratch, have a relatively short shelf life and need to be consumed within a few days. Heinz Gluten-Free Gravy, however, comes in a convenient jar or packet that can be stored for months, making it a practical option for those who want to have gravy on hand without the need for frequent preparation.</p>
