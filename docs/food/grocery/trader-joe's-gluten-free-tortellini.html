    <p>As you can see, the tortellini is relatively low in fat and provides a moderate amount of protein, making it a balanced option for a meal. However, it’s worth noting that the sodium content is on the higher side, so those monitoring their sodium intake may want to pair it with low-sodium sauces or ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Cooking Tips and Serving Suggestions</h2>

    <p>Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Tortellini is incredibly easy to prepare, making it a convenient option for busy weeknights. Here are some tips to ensure you get the most out of this product:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Boiling:</strong> Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and add the tortellini. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until the pasta is tender but still firm to the bite. Be careful not to overcook, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy if left in boiling water for too long.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce Pairings:</strong> This tortellini pairs beautifully with a variety of sauces. A simple marinara or Alfredo sauce works well, but you can also try pesto, olive oil with garlic, or a creamy cheese sauce for a richer flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Add-Ins:</strong> Enhance your dish by adding vegetables like spinach, cherry tomatoes, or roasted red peppers. For a protein boost, consider adding grilled chicken, shrimp, or tofu.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking:</strong> For a heartier meal, try baking the tortellini with sauce and cheese. Layer the cooked tortellini in a baking dish, top with your favorite sauce and shredded cheese, and bake at 375°F for about 20 minutes, or until bubbly and golden.</li>
    </ul>
