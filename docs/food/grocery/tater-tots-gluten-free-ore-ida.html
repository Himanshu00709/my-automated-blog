    <h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Tater Tots</h2>

    <p>One of the best things about Ore-Ida's gluten-free tater tots is how easy they are to prepare. Here’s a quick guide to cooking them to perfection:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Spread the tater tots in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes, turning halfway through, until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Air Fryer:</strong> For an even crispier result, use an air fryer. Preheat to 400°F (200°C) and cook for 10-15 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through.</li>
        <li><strong>Microwave:</strong> If you’re in a hurry, you can microwave the tots for 3-4 minutes. However, this method may not yield the same level of crispiness as the oven or air fryer.</li>
    </ol>
