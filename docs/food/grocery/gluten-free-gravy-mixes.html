    <h1>Gluten-Free Gravy Mixes: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gravy is a staple in many cuisines, adding richness and flavor to dishes like mashed potatoes, roasted meats, and casseroles. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, traditional gravy mixes can be off-limits due to their wheat-based thickeners. Fortunately, gluten-free gravy mixes have become increasingly popular, offering a safe and delicious alternative. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free gravy mixes, including their benefits, how to choose the best ones, and even how to make your own at home.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Gravy Mixes?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free gravy mixes are essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Consuming gluten can lead to severe digestive issues, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term health complications for these individuals. Even for those without gluten intolerance, opting for gluten-free options can be a healthier choice, as they often contain fewer processed ingredients and are free from artificial additives.</p>

    <p>Moreover, gluten-free gravy mixes are versatile and can be used in a variety of dishes, from traditional holiday meals to everyday cooking. They are typically made with alternative thickeners like cornstarch, rice flour, or tapioca starch, which provide the same smooth, velvety texture as traditional gravy without the gluten.</p>
