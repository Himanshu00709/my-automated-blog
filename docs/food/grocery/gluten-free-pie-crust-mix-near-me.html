<ol>

    <li><strong>Use Cold Ingredients:</strong> If the mix calls for butter or water, make sure they are cold to help achieve a flaky texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Roll Between Parchment Paper:</strong> Gluten-free dough can be more delicate, so rolling it between two sheets of parchment paper can make it easier to handle.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-Bake if Necessary:</strong> Some recipes may require pre-baking the crust before adding the filling. Follow the recipe guidelines for best results.</li>
