    <h2>How to Use Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Pizza Dough</h2>
    <p>Using Trader Joe's gluten-free pizza dough is straightforward, but there are a few tips and tricks to ensure you get the best results. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Thaw the Dough</h3>
    <p>If you’ve stored the dough in the freezer, make sure to thaw it in the refrigerator overnight. This will make it easier to handle and shape.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats to ensure it gets nice and hot.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare Your Work Surface</h3>
    <p>Lightly dust your work surface with gluten-free flour or cornmeal to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough to your desired thickness, keeping in mind that gluten-free dough tends to be a bit more delicate than traditional dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Your Toppings</h3>
    <p>Once your dough is rolled out, transfer it to a parchment-lined baking sheet or pizza peel if you’re using a pizza stone. Add your favorite toppings, but be mindful not to overload the pizza, as this can make it harder to cook evenly.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the pizza for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the toppings are cooked through. Keep an eye on it, as gluten-free dough can cook faster than traditional dough.</p>

    <h2>Creative Topping Ideas</h2>
    <p>One of the best things about making pizza at home is the ability to customize it to your liking. Here are some creative topping ideas to try with Trader Joe's gluten-free pizza dough:</p>
