    <h2>How Do They Compare to Traditional Egg Rolls?</h2>
    <p>Traditional egg rolls are typically made with a wheat-based wrapper, which contains gluten. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming traditional egg rolls can lead to uncomfortable symptoms such as bloating, stomach pain, and diarrhea. Aldi's gluten-free egg rolls, on the other hand, are made with a gluten-free wrapper, making them a safe and enjoyable option for those who need to avoid gluten. Additionally, the filling in Aldi's gluten-free egg rolls is made with simple, wholesome ingredients, which may be a healthier option compared to some traditional egg rolls that contain preservatives and artificial flavors.</p>

    <h2>Preparation and Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>One of the best things about Aldi's gluten-free egg rolls is how easy they are to prepare. Simply preheat your oven or air fryer, place the egg rolls on a baking sheet or in the air fryer basket, and cook for a few minutes until they are golden brown and crispy. You can also deep-fry them if you prefer a more traditional texture. Once cooked, serve the egg rolls with your favorite dipping sauce, such as sweet and sour sauce, soy sauce, or even a spicy sriracha mayo. They make a great appetizer for parties or a quick and satisfying snack.</p>
