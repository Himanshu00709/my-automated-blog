For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Gluten-free bread is crafted using alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, coconut flour, or a blend of gluten-free grains. These flours provide the necessary structure and texture that gluten typically offers in traditional bread.</p>

        <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich:</strong> Many gluten-free breads are fortified with vitamins and minerals to compensate for the nutrients lost when eliminating gluten-containing grains.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety:</strong> The gluten-free bread market offers a wide range of options, from traditional loaves to artisanal varieties, catering to diverse tastes and preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight Management:</strong> Some people find that a gluten-free diet helps with weight management, although this is not universally true and depends on individual dietary habits.</li>
