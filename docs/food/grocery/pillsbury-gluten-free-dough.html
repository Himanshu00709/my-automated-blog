    <h2>How to Use Pillsbury Gluten-Free Dough</h2>

    <p>Using Pillsbury Gluten-Free Dough is straightforward, but there are a few tips and tricks to ensure the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Thawing:</strong> If the dough is frozen, allow it to thaw in the refrigerator before use. This ensures even baking and prevents the dough from becoming too sticky.</li>

        <li><strong>Baking:</strong> Follow the baking instructions on the package, but keep an eye on your baked goods as they may cook faster or slower depending on your oven. Gluten-free dough can sometimes brown more quickly than traditional dough.</li>
