    <h1>Gluten-Free Gravy Granules: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gravy is a staple in many households, especially during festive seasons or family dinners. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, traditional gravy can be off-limits due to its gluten content. Enter gluten-free gravy granules—a convenient and safe alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this beloved condiment without worry. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free gravy granules, from their benefits to how to use them, and even some FAQs to address common concerns.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Gravy Granules?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free gravy granules are a powdered or granulated form of gravy that is free from gluten-containing ingredients. Traditional gravy often uses wheat flour as a thickening agent, which contains gluten. Gluten-free versions, however, use alternative thickeners such as cornstarch, potato starch, or rice flour. These granules are designed to dissolve in hot water or stock, creating a smooth and flavorful gravy that is safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Gravy Granules</h2>

    <p>There are several advantages to using gluten-free gravy granules, especially for those who need to avoid gluten:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Safe for Celiac Disease and Gluten Intolerance:</strong> Gluten-free gravy granules are specifically formulated to be free from gluten, making them safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.</li>
        <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> These granules are incredibly easy to use. Simply mix them with hot water or stock, and you have a delicious gravy ready in minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Gluten-free gravy granules can be used in a variety of dishes, from traditional roast dinners to casseroles and stews.</li>
        <li><strong>Wide Availability:</strong> With the growing demand for gluten-free products, many brands now offer gluten-free gravy granules, making them readily available in most supermarkets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use Gluten-Free Gravy Granules</h2>

    <p>Using gluten-free gravy granules is straightforward, but there are a few tips to ensure you get the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Measure the Granules:</strong> Start by measuring out the required amount of granules. Most brands will provide instructions on the packaging, but a general rule of thumb is 1-2 tablespoons per cup of liquid.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Hot Liquid:</strong> Gradually add hot water or stock to the granules, stirring continuously to prevent lumps from forming.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Consistency:</strong> If the gravy is too thick, add more liquid. If it’s too thin, let it simmer for a few minutes to reduce, or add a bit more granules.</li>
        <li><strong>Season to Taste:</strong> Taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning if necessary. You can add salt, pepper, or herbs to enhance the flavor.</li>
    </ol>
