For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding safe and delicious options can sometimes be a challenge. Fortunately, pork and beans can easily be made gluten-free with a few simple adjustments. In this article, we’ll explore the history of pork and beans, how to make it gluten-free, and why it’s a great option for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>The History of Pork and Beans</h2>

Today, pork and beans are enjoyed in various forms around the world, from traditional baked beans to modern, gluten-free versions.</p>
