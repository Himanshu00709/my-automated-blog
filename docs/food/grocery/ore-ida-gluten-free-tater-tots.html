    <h2>Cooking Tips and Serving Suggestions</h2>

    <p>One of the best things about Ore-Ida Gluten-Free Tater Tots is their versatility. Here are some tips to get the most out of your tater tots:</p>

    <h3>1. Baking</h3>
    <p>For a healthier option, bake your tater tots in the oven. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C), spread the tots in a single layer on a baking sheet, and bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through. This method ensures a crispy exterior without the extra oil.</p>

    <h3>2. Air Frying</h3>
    <p>If you have an air fryer, you’re in for a treat. Air frying tater tots results in an even crispier texture. Set your air fryer to 400°F (200°C) and cook for 10-15 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through.</p>

    <h3>3. Serving Suggestions</h3>
    <p>Tater tots are incredibly versatile. Here are some creative ways to serve them:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Breakfast Tots:</strong> Top with scrambled eggs, cheese, and bacon for a hearty breakfast.</li>
        <li><strong>Tater Tot Casserole:</strong> Layer tater tots with ground beef, cheese, and cream of mushroom soup for a comforting casserole.</li>
        <li><strong>Loaded Tots:</strong> Pile on your favorite toppings like sour cream, chives, and shredded cheese for a loaded potato experience.</li>
    </ul>
