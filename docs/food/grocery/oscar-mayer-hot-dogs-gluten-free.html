<h3>Potential Cross-Contamination Risks</h3>

<p>While many Oscar Mayer hot dogs are gluten-free, it’s important to be aware of potential cross-contamination risks. Cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process if gluten-free products are processed on the same equipment as gluten-containing products. Oscar Mayer does not explicitly state that their facilities are gluten-free, so individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease should exercise caution.</p>

<h2>Ingredients to Watch Out For</h2>

<p>When determining if a hot dog is gluten-free, it’s essential to examine the ingredient list. Here are some common ingredients found in hot dogs that may contain gluten:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Modified Food Starch:</strong> This can be derived from wheat, which contains gluten. However, if it’s derived from corn or potato, it’s gluten-free.</li>
    <li><strong>Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein:</strong> This is a clear source of gluten and should be avoided.</li>
    <li><strong>Malt:</strong> Malt is derived from barley and contains gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Dextrin:</strong> While dextrin is typically gluten-free, it can sometimes be derived from wheat.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oscar Mayer hot dogs generally avoid these ingredients, but it’s always a good practice to read the label carefully.</p>
