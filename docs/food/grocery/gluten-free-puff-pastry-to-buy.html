<h1>Gluten-Free Puff Pastry: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular over the years, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference. One of the most challenging aspects of gluten-free baking is finding suitable alternatives for traditional wheat-based products. Puff pastry, with its delicate layers and buttery texture, is a prime example. Fortunately, there are now several high-quality gluten-free puff pastry options available for purchase. In this guide, we’ll explore the best gluten-free puff pastry brands, how to use them, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>
