    <h1>Cap'n Crunch Berries Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For many cereal lovers, Cap'n Crunch Berries has been a breakfast staple for decades. Its sweet, crunchy texture and vibrant berry flavors make it a favorite among both kids and adults. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this iconic cereal has often been off the table—until now. In recent years, there has been a growing demand for gluten-free options, and Cap'n Crunch Berries has stepped up to the plate. But is it truly gluten-free? Let’s dive into the details.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Cap'n Crunch Berries Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Cap'n Crunch Berries, like its original counterpart, is made primarily from corn and oat flour. The key difference in the gluten-free version lies in the sourcing and processing of these ingredients. Traditional oats are often cross-contaminated with gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye during farming and processing. To create a gluten-free product, the oats used in Cap'n Crunch Berries are carefully sourced and processed in dedicated gluten-free facilities to avoid cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the gluten-free version of Cap'n Crunch Berries undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it meets the FDA’s gluten-free standards, which require products to contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. This makes it a safe option for most people with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>
