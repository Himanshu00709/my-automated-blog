    <h1>Gluten-Free Gravy Jar: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gravy is a staple in many households, especially during festive seasons and family gatherings. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, traditional gravy can be off-limits due to its wheat-based thickeners. Enter the gluten-free gravy jar—a convenient, delicious, and safe alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this beloved condiment without worry. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free gravy jars, from their benefits to how to use them, and even some tips for making your own at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Gravy?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free gravy is a sauce made without any gluten-containing ingredients.

    <p>Gluten-free gravy jars are pre-made versions of this sauce, typically sold in stores or online. They come in a variety of flavors, from classic turkey or beef to vegetarian options, making them a versatile addition to any meal.</p>
