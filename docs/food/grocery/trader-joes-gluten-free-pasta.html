    <h2>Cooking Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Pasta</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free pasta can be a bit different from cooking traditional wheat-based pasta. Here are some tips to ensure your Trader Joe's gluten-free pasta turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to absorb more water, so make sure to use a large pot with plenty of boiling water.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> To prevent sticking, stir the pasta frequently during the first few minutes of cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness Early:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can go from perfectly cooked to overcooked quickly, so start checking for doneness a minute or two before the recommended cooking time.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> While some people rinse pasta to remove excess starch, this can make gluten-free pasta gummy. It’s best to avoid rinsing unless the recipe specifically calls for it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Does Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Pasta Compare to Other Brands?</h2>

    <p>When it comes to gluten-free pasta, there are several brands on the market, each with its own unique blend of ingredients and textures. Here’s how Trader Joe's gluten-free pasta compares to some of the most popular alternatives:</p>
