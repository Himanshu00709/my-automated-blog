<h1>Hormel Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten intolerance. Among the many brands that have risen to the occasion, Hormel Foods has emerged as a trusted name in the gluten-free market. This blog post delves into the world of Hormel Gluten-Free products, exploring their benefits, variety, and how they cater to the needs of those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten and Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Gluten sensitivity, on the other hand, can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue without the intestinal damage seen in celiac disease.</p>

<p>Going gluten-free is not just a trend; for many, it's a necessity. Hormel Foods has recognized this need and has developed a range of gluten-free products that allow individuals to enjoy their favorite foods without compromising their health.</p>
