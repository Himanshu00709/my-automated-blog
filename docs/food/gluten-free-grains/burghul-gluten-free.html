    <h1>Burghul: A Gluten-Free Superfood?</h1>

    <p>Burghul, also known as bulgur, is a staple in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. It is a versatile grain that has been enjoyed for centuries due to its nutritional benefits and ease of preparation. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets, many people are questioning whether burghul is a safe option for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. In this article, we will explore the gluten content of burghul, its nutritional profile, and whether it can be considered a gluten-free superfood.</p>

    <h2>What is Burghul?</h2>

    <p>Burghul is a whole grain made from cracked wheat kernels that have been parboiled, dried, and then ground into various sizes. It is commonly used in dishes like tabbouleh, kibbeh, and pilafs.
