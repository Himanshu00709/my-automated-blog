<h1>Dairy-Free Gluten-Free Candy: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with dietary restrictions, finding delicious and safe treats can be a challenge. Whether you're avoiding dairy due to lactose intolerance, a milk allergy, or a vegan lifestyle, or steering clear of gluten because of celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, the world of candy can seem limited. However, the good news is that there are plenty of dairy-free and gluten-free candy options available today. In this article, we'll explore the best dairy-free and gluten-free candies, how to identify them, and why they might be the perfect choice for you.</p>

<h2>Understanding Dairy-Free and Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

<p>Before diving into the world of dairy-free and gluten-free candy, it's essential to understand what these terms mean. A dairy-free diet excludes all forms of dairy, including milk, cheese, butter, and yogurt. This is often necessary for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to milk proteins, or following a vegan lifestyle. On the other hand, a gluten-free diet eliminates gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. This is crucial for individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergies.</p>

<p>When it comes to candy, both dairy and gluten can be hidden ingredients. Dairy is often used in chocolates and creamy candies, while gluten can be found in candies that use wheat-based ingredients or are processed in facilities that handle gluten-containing products. Therefore, it's important to carefully read labels and look for certifications to ensure that the candy you're consuming is truly dairy-free and gluten-free.</p>

<h2>Popular Dairy-Free Gluten-Free Candy Brands</h2>
