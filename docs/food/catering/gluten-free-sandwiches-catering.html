    <h1>Gluten-Free Sandwiches Catering: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by an increasing awareness of gluten-related health issues such as celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergies. Catering to this growing need, gluten-free sandwiches have become a staple in the catering industry. Whether you're planning a corporate event, a wedding, or a casual gathering, offering gluten-free sandwich options ensures that all your guests can enjoy a delicious and safe meal. This guide will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free sandwiches catering, from ingredients and preparation to presentation and FAQs.</p>

Additionally, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergies impact millions more. For these individuals, consuming gluten can lead to severe health complications, including digestive issues, skin rashes, and even neurological problems. By offering gluten-free sandwich options, you demonstrate inclusivity and care for your guests' dietary needs, ensuring everyone can partake in the meal without worry.</p>

    <h2>Key Ingredients for Gluten-Free Sandwiches</h2>
