    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Walnuts</h2>
    <p>Walnuts are not just gluten-free; they are also a powerhouse of health benefits. Here are some of the key advantages of incorporating walnuts into your diet:</p>

    <h3>1. Heart Health</h3>
    <p>Walnuts are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to reduce inflammation and improve heart health. Studies have shown that regular consumption of walnuts can lower bad cholesterol (LDL) levels and improve the function of blood vessels, reducing the risk of heart disease.</p>
