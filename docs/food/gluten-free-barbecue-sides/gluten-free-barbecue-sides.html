    <h1>Gluten-Free Barbecue Sides: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Barbecues are a staple of summer gatherings, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding the right sides can be a challenge. Gluten-free diets require careful attention to ingredients, but that doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice flavor or variety. In this guide, we’ll explore a range of delicious gluten-free barbecue sides that are sure to impress your guests. From classic potato salads to inventive grilled vegetable dishes, we’ve got you covered.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Barbecue Sides Matter</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause serious health issues for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Even a small amount of gluten can trigger symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. For this reason, it’s crucial to ensure that all dishes served at a barbecue are free from gluten-containing ingredients. Fortunately, there are plenty of naturally gluten-free foods, and with a little creativity, you can create sides that are both safe and delicious.</p>

    <h2>Top Gluten-Free Barbecue Sides</h2>

    <h3>1. Classic Potato Salad</h3>

    <p>Potato salad is a barbecue staple, and it’s naturally gluten-free when made with the right ingredients. Start with boiled potatoes, and mix in mayonnaise, mustard, and a variety of fresh herbs. Be sure to check that your mayonnaise and mustard are gluten-free, as some brands may contain hidden gluten. Add in some chopped celery, onions, and hard-boiled eggs for extra flavor and texture.</p>

    <h3>2. Grilled Vegetable Platter</h3>

    <p>Grilled vegetables are a healthy and flavorful addition to any barbecue. Slice up zucchini, bell peppers, eggplant, and mushrooms, then toss them in olive oil, salt, and pepper. Grill until tender and slightly charred. You can also add a sprinkle of fresh herbs or a drizzle of balsamic glaze for an extra touch of flavor.</p>

    <h3>3. Quinoa Salad</h3>

    <p>Quinoa is a gluten-free grain that’s packed with protein and fiber. For a refreshing quinoa salad, cook the quinoa according to package instructions, then mix in diced cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, red onion, and feta cheese. Dress with olive oil, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt and pepper. This salad is light, nutritious, and perfect for a summer barbecue.</p>

    <h3>4. Corn on the Cob</h3>

    <p>Corn on the cob is a classic barbecue side that’s naturally gluten-free. Simply boil or grill the corn, then slather it with butter and sprinkle with salt. For a twist, try adding a sprinkle of chili powder or a squeeze of lime juice. Corn on the cob is easy to prepare and always a crowd-pleaser.</p>

    <h3>5. Coleslaw</h3>

    <p>Coleslaw is another gluten-free favorite that pairs perfectly with barbecue. Shred cabbage and carrots, then mix with a dressing made from mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, and a touch of sugar. Be sure to use gluten-free mayonnaise, and consider adding in some chopped apples or raisins for a sweet and tangy twist.</p>
