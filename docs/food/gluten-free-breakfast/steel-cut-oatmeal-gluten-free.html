    <h1>Steel Cut Oatmeal: A Gluten-Free Superfood</h1>

    <p>Steel cut oatmeal has gained immense popularity in recent years, especially among health-conscious individuals and those following a gluten-free diet. Unlike rolled oats or instant oats, steel cut oats are less processed, retaining more of their natural nutrients and providing a hearty, chewy texture. But what makes steel cut oatmeal a standout choice for those avoiding gluten? In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of steel cut oatmeal, its gluten-free status, and how you can incorporate it into your daily diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Steel Cut Oats?</h2>

    <p>Steel cut oats, also known as Irish oats or pinhead oats, are whole oat groats that have been chopped into two or three pieces using steel blades. This minimal processing gives them a distinct texture and a nuttier flavor compared to rolled or instant oats. Because they are less processed, steel cut oats take longer to cook, but the result is a creamy, satisfying bowl of oatmeal that is packed with nutrients.</p>

    <h2>Are Steel Cut Oats Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Oats are naturally gluten-free, but the issue of cross-contamination often arises during processing. Many oats are processed in facilities that also handle wheat, barley, and rye, which can lead to contamination with gluten. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, this can be a significant concern.</p>

    <p>However, certified gluten-free steel cut oats are available on the market. These oats are grown, harvested, and processed in dedicated gluten-free facilities, ensuring that they are safe for those who need to avoid gluten. Always look for the "certified gluten-free" label when purchasing steel cut oats to ensure they meet strict gluten-free standards.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Steel Cut Oats</h2>
