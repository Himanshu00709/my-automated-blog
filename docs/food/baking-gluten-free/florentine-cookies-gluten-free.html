    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Florentine Cookies</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free Florentine cookies is a straightforward process. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a bowl, combine the sliced almonds, gluten-free oats, and gluten-free flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the wet ingredients:</strong> In a saucepan, melt the butter or coconut oil over low heat. Add the honey, sugar, and vanilla extract, stirring until the mixture is smooth and well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the mixtures:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix until everything is evenly coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the cookies:</strong> Drop spoonfuls of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving enough space between each cookie as they will spread during baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the cookies for 8-10 minutes, or until they are golden brown around the edges. Keep an eye on them, as they can burn quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and dip in chocolate:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool completely on the baking sheet. Once cooled, you can dip them in melted dark chocolate or drizzle the chocolate over the top for an extra touch of indulgence.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Florentine Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free Florentine cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a silicone baking mat:</strong> This will help prevent the cookies from sticking and make cleanup easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch the baking time:</strong> Florentine cookies can go from golden to burnt very quickly, so keep a close eye on them while they're in the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Feel free to add other ingredients like dried cranberries, orange zest, or even a pinch of cinnamon to customize the flavor of your cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Keep the cookies in an airtight container to maintain their crispiness. They can also be frozen for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>
