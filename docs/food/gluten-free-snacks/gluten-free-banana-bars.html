    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free banana bars is simple and straightforward. Follow these steps to create a delicious batch:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and greasing a baking dish with a little oil or butter.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash the Bananas:</strong> In a large bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. The smoother the bananas, the more even the texture of your bars will be.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Wet Ingredients:</strong> Add the eggs, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract to the mashed bananas. Mix well until fully combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Optional Ingredients:</strong> If you’re using any add-ins like nuts or chocolate chips, fold them into the batter at this stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and spread it evenly. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the bars to cool completely before cutting them into squares. Serve as is or with a drizzle of honey or a dollop of yogurt.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Banana Bars</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free banana bars turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Ripe Bananas:</strong> The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more flavorful your bars will be. Overripe bananas with brown spots are ideal.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to dense bars. Mix until just combined to keep the texture light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flours:</strong> Different gluten-free flours can yield slightly different textures. Almond flour adds richness, while oat flour gives a chewier texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store the bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or refrigerate for up to a week.</li>
    </ul>
