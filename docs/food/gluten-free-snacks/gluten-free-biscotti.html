    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Fold in your chosen add-ins, such as nuts or dried fruit.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into two logs, each about 12 inches long and 2 inches wide, and place them on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the logs are firm to the touch.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F (160°C).</li>
        <li>Slice the logs diagonally into 1-inch thick pieces and place them cut-side down on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the biscotti are golden and crisp.</li>
        <li>Let cool completely before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Biscotti</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free biscotti can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to achieve the perfect texture and flavor:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> A good gluten-free flour blend is essential for the right texture. Look for one that includes xanthan gum, which helps bind the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough biscotti. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Logs Cool Before Slicing:</strong> Allowing the logs to cool slightly before slicing will make it easier to cut them into even pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Gluten-free biscotti can be stored in an airtight container for up to two weeks. For longer storage, freeze them in a zip-top bag.</li>
