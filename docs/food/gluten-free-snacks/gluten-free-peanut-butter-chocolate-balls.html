    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make these delicious gluten-free peanut butter chocolate balls:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Peanut Butter Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter, gluten-free oats, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly combined. The mixture should be thick and sticky, making it easy to roll into balls.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Roll the Mixture into Balls</h3>
    <p>Using your hands, scoop out small portions of the mixture and roll them into bite-sized balls. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Once all the balls are rolled, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to allow the balls to firm up.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Melt the Chocolate</h3>
    <p>While the peanut butter balls are chilling, melt the dark chocolate chips and coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Coat the Balls with Chocolate</h3>
    <p>Remove the peanut butter balls from the refrigerator. Using a fork or a toothpick, dip each ball into the melted chocolate, ensuring it's fully coated. Place the coated balls back on the parchment paper and let them set in the refrigerator for another 15-20 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the chocolate has hardened, your gluten-free peanut butter chocolate balls are ready to be served! Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>

        <h3>2. Are these balls suitable for a vegan diet?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the honey with maple syrup and use dairy-free chocolate chips to make these balls vegan-friendly.</p>
