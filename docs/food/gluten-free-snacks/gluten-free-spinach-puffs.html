    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free spinach puffs is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a batch of delicious, flaky puffs:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). This ensures the pastry bakes evenly and becomes golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Spinach:</strong> Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté until fragrant. Toss in the chopped spinach and cook until wilted. Remove from heat and let it cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a bowl, mix the sautéed spinach with crumbled feta cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Pastry:</strong> Roll out the gluten-free puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Cut it into squares or circles, depending on your preference.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Puffs:</strong> Place a spoonful of the spinach and feta mixture in the center of each pastry piece. Fold the edges over to seal the filling inside.</li>
        <li><strong>Brush with Egg Wash:</strong> Brush the tops of the puffs with beaten egg to give them a shiny, golden finish.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the puffs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the pastry is puffed and golden.</li>
    </ol>

Feta cheese adds a dose of calcium and protein, while the gluten-free pastry ensures that those with gluten sensitivities can enjoy this treat without worry.
