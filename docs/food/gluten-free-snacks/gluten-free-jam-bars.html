    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your own gluten-free jam bars:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, rolled oats, melted coconut oil, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix until the ingredients are well combined and form a crumbly dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Press the Dough</h3>
    <p>Press about two-thirds of the dough into the bottom of the prepared baking pan, ensuring it's evenly distributed. Use the back of a spoon or your fingers to press it down firmly.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Jam</h3>
    <p>Spread the fruit jam evenly over the pressed dough, leaving a small border around the edges to prevent the jam from spilling over during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Topping</h3>
    <p>Crumble the remaining dough over the jam layer, creating a streusel-like topping. This will give your jam bars a delightful texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the jam is bubbling slightly. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely in the pan before cutting into bars.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Jam Bars</h2>

        <h3>Can I substitute the coconut oil?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you don't have coconut oil, you can use melted butter or another neutral oil like avocado oil. Just keep in mind that the flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <p>Store the jam bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for longer storage.</p>
