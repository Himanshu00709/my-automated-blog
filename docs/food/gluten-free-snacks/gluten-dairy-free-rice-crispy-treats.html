<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free and dairy-free rice crispy treats is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create your own batch:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Pan:</strong> Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with dairy-free butter or coconut oil. This will prevent the treats from sticking to the pan.</li>
    <li><strong>Melt the Butter:</strong> In a large saucepan, melt the dairy-free butter or coconut oil over low heat. Be careful not to let it burn.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Marshmallows:</strong> Once the butter is melted, add the dairy-free marshmallows. Stir continuously until the marshmallows are completely melted and the mixture is smooth.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix in Vanilla:</strong> If using, stir in the vanilla extract for added flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine with Cereal:</strong> Remove the saucepan from heat and quickly add the gluten-free rice cereal. Stir until the cereal is evenly coated with the marshmallow mixture.</li>
    <li><strong>Press into Pan:</strong> Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish. Use a spatula or your hands (lightly greased) to press the mixture firmly into the pan.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and Cut:</strong> Allow the treats to cool completely before cutting them into squares. This will ensure they hold their shape.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free and Dairy-Free Rice Crispy Treats</h2>

<p>To ensure your rice crispy treats turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Fresh Marshmallows:</strong> Fresh marshmallows melt more evenly and create a better texture. Stale marshmallows can result in a less cohesive treat.</li>
    <li><strong>Work Quickly:</strong> Once the marshmallow mixture is combined with the cereal, work quickly to press it into the pan. The mixture will start to set as it cools.</li>
    <li><strong>Customize Your Treats:</strong> Feel free to add mix-ins like chocolate chips, dried fruit, or nuts to make your treats unique.</li>
    <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Keep the treats in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to a month.</li>
</ul>
