    <h1>Gluten-Free Polvorones: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Polvorones, also known as Spanish shortbread cookies, are a beloved treat that originated in Spain. These crumbly, melt-in-your-mouth cookies are traditionally made with wheat flour, sugar, butter, and almonds. However, with the rise of gluten intolerance and celiac disease, many people are seeking gluten-free alternatives to enjoy this delightful dessert. Enter gluten-free polvorones—a delicious and safe option for those who need to avoid gluten without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Polvorones?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free polvorones are a variation of the traditional Spanish cookie, made without any gluten-containing ingredients. Instead of wheat flour, these cookies use gluten-free flours such as almond flour, rice flour, or a blend of gluten-free flours. The result is a cookie that is just as crumbly and flavorful as the original, but safe for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Polvorones?</h2>

    <p>There are several reasons why someone might choose gluten-free polvorones:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gluten Intolerance or Celiac Disease:</strong> For individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues. Gluten-free polvorones provide a safe and delicious alternative.</li>
        <li><strong>Dietary Preferences:</strong> Some people choose to avoid gluten for personal or dietary reasons, even if they do not have a medical condition. Gluten-free polvorones allow them to enjoy a traditional treat without compromising their dietary choices.</li>
        <li><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, are often higher in protein and healthy fats compared to traditional wheat flour. This can make gluten-free polvorones a slightly healthier option.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, gluten-free all-purpose flour, powdered sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the softened butter and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter, and place them on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Flatten each ball slightly with the palm of your hand or the bottom of a glass.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool completely before serving. They will be very crumbly, so handle them gently.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Polvorones</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free polvorones turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Ingredients:</strong> Since gluten-free baking can be a bit finicky, it’s important to use high-quality ingredients. This includes fresh almond flour, good-quality butter, and pure vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix the dough just until it comes together.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too soft to handle, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before shaping the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Gluten-free polvorones can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze the cookies in a single layer and then transfer them to a freezer-safe container.</li>
    </ul>
