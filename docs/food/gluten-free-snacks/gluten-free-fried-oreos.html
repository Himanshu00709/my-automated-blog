    </table>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Batter:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk and egg. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a smooth batter forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong> In a deep skillet or frying pan, heat the vegetable oil to 375°F (190°C). Use a thermometer to ensure the oil reaches the correct temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the Cookies:</strong> Dip each gluten-free Oreo into the batter, ensuring it’s fully coated. Allow any excess batter to drip off before carefully placing the cookie into the hot oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Cookies:</strong> Fry the cookies for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until they turn golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Dust with Powdered Sugar:</strong> Once the cookies have cooled slightly, dust them with powdered sugar for an extra touch of sweetness.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Fried Oreos</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free fried Oreos turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Opt for a blend that’s specifically designed for frying, as it will yield a crispier texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor the Oil Temperature:</strong> Maintaining the correct oil temperature is crucial. If the oil is too hot, the cookies will burn; if it’s too cool, they’ll absorb too much oil and become greasy.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overcrowd the Pan:</strong> Fry the cookies in small batches to ensure they cook evenly and don’t stick together.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> While powdered sugar is a classic choice, feel free to get creative with toppings like chocolate sauce, caramel drizzle, or even a scoop of gluten-free ice cream.</li>
    </ul>
