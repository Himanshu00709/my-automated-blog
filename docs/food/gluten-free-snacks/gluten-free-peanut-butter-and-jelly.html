    <h1>Gluten-Free Peanut Butter and Jelly: A Healthy Twist on a Classic</h1>
    <p>For many, the peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a nostalgic comfort food, evoking memories of childhood lunches and simple pleasures. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic treat can be a challenge. Enter the gluten-free peanut butter and jelly sandwich—a delicious and safe alternative that doesn’t compromise on taste or texture. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of going gluten-free, how to make the perfect gluten-free PB&J, and answer some common questions about this beloved snack.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to fatigue and even long-term health complications. A gluten-free diet is essential for managing these conditions, but it’s also becoming increasingly popular among those without gluten-related health issues. Many people report feeling more energetic and less bloated when they eliminate gluten from their diets.</p>

    <h2>Choosing the Right Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Creating a gluten-free peanut butter and jelly sandwich starts with selecting the right ingredients. Here’s what you need to know:</p>

    <h3>1. Gluten-Free Bread</h3>
    <p>The foundation of any sandwich is the bread, and for a gluten-free PB&J, you’ll need to choose a gluten-free option. There are many gluten-free bread varieties available, made from ingredients like rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca starch. Look for bread that is soft and slightly sweet to mimic the texture and flavor of traditional white bread.</p>

    <h3>2. Peanut Butter</h3>
    <p>Most peanut butter is naturally gluten-free, but it’s always a good idea to check the label. Some brands may add gluten-containing ingredients or process their peanut butter in facilities that also handle gluten. Opt for natural peanut butter with no added sugars or oils for a healthier option.</p>

    <h3>3. Jelly or Jam</h3>
    <p>Like peanut butter, most jellies and jams are gluten-free. However, some brands may use additives or thickeners that contain gluten. Always read the label to ensure your jelly is safe. For a healthier twist, consider using fruit preserves with no added sugars or making your own jam at home.</p>

    <h2>How to Make the Perfect Gluten-Free PB&J</h2>
    <p>Now that you’ve gathered your ingredients, it’s time to assemble your sandwich. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>Spread a layer of jelly or jam on the other slice of bread. Strawberry, grape, or raspberry are classic choices, but feel free to get creative with flavors like apricot or blueberry.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>Press the two slices of bread together, peanut butter side facing the jelly side.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>Cut the sandwich in half if desired, and enjoy!</td>
