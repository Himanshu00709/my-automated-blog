    <h1>Gluten-Free Chocolate Peanut Butter Balls: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>

    <p>In the world of gluten-free desserts, few treats are as universally loved as chocolate peanut butter balls. These bite-sized delights are not only delicious but also incredibly easy to make.

    <p>Choosing gluten-free desserts like chocolate peanut butter balls allows you to enjoy your favorite treats without compromising your health. Plus, these balls are packed with wholesome ingredients that provide essential nutrients, making them a guilt-free indulgence.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten-free chocolate peanut butter balls.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Peanut Butter Mixture</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter, honey, and vanilla extract. Stir until the mixture is smooth and well combined. If the mixture is too sticky, you can add a bit more oats to achieve the desired consistency.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Oats</h3>

    <p>Gradually add the gluten-free oats to the peanut butter mixture, stirring as you go. The oats will help bind the mixture together and give the balls a satisfying texture. Once the mixture is well combined, cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to firm up.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Form the Balls</h3>

    <p>After the mixture has chilled, use a tablespoon or a small cookie scoop to portion out the mixture. Roll each portion into a ball using your hands. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and return them to the refrigerator while you prepare the chocolate coating.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Melt the Chocolate</h3>

    <p>In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the dark chocolate chips and coconut oil. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth. Be careful not to overheat the chocolate, as it can become grainy.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Coat the Balls</h3>

    <p>Remove the peanut butter balls from the refrigerator. Using a fork or a dipping tool, carefully dip each ball into the melted chocolate, ensuring it is fully coated. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off before placing the coated balls back on the parchment paper. Repeat this process until all the balls are coated.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Chill and Serve</h3>

    <p>Once all the balls are coated in chocolate, place the baking sheet back in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to allow the chocolate to set. Once the chocolate is firm, your gluten-free chocolate peanut butter balls are ready to serve! Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different nut butter?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute peanut butter with almond butter, cashew butter, or any other nut butter of your choice. Just make sure it's unsweetened and natural for the best results.</p>

        <h3>Are these balls suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these balls vegan by using maple syrup instead of honey and ensuring the chocolate chips are dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze these chocolate peanut butter balls?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! These balls freeze well. Place them in an airtight container and store them in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before serving.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of oats?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use oats, you can substitute them with almond flour or crushed gluten-free graham crackers. The texture will be slightly different, but still delicious.</p>
    </div>
