    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free peanut butter balls:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter, honey (or maple syrup), gluten-free oats, and vanilla extract. Stir until the mixture is well combined and forms a dough-like consistency.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Form the Balls</h3>
    <p>Using your hands, roll the mixture into small, bite-sized balls. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Once all the balls are formed, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to allow the balls to firm up.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Melt the Chocolate</h3>
    <p>In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate chips and coconut oil. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate is fully melted and smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Coat the Balls</h3>
    <p>Remove the peanut butter balls from the refrigerator. Using a fork or a dipping tool, dip each ball into the melted chocolate, ensuring they are fully coated. Place the coated balls back on the parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once all the balls are coated, return the baking sheet to the refrigerator for another 30 minutes to allow the chocolate to set. Once set, your gluten-free peanut butter balls are ready to serve!</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Balls</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free peanut butter balls are not only delicious but also offer several nutritional benefits. Peanut butter is a great source of protein, healthy fats, and essential vitamins like vitamin E and B6. The gluten-free oats provide fiber, which aids in digestion and helps keep you feeling full longer.
