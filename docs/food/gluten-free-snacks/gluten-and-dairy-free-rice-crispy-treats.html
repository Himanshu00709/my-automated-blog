    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten and dairy-free rice crispy treats:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gather all your ingredients and measure them out. Ensure that your rice cereal is certified gluten-free and that your marshmallows and butter are dairy-free. This will help you avoid any cross-contamination or accidental ingestion of gluten or dairy.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Melt the Butter</h3>
    <p>In a large saucepan, melt the dairy-free butter over low heat. Be careful not to let it burn. Once melted, add the dairy-free marshmallows and stir continuously until they are completely melted and smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Vanilla Extract</h3>
    <p>If you’re using vanilla extract, add it to the melted marshmallow mixture and stir well. This will give your rice crispy treats a subtle, sweet flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Mix in the Rice Cereal</h3>
    <p>Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the gluten-free rice cereal. Stir until the cereal is evenly coated with the marshmallow mixture. Make sure to mix thoroughly to ensure that every bite is full of flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Press into a Pan</h3>
    <p>Transfer the mixture to a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Use a spatula or your hands (lightly greased with dairy-free butter) to press the mixture evenly into the pan. Allow the treats to cool and set for at least 30 minutes before cutting into squares.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten and Dairy-Free Rice Crispy Treats</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular marshmallows?</h3>
        <p>No, regular marshmallows typically contain gelatin, which is derived from animal products and may not be suitable for those avoiding dairy. Always opt for dairy-free marshmallows to ensure your treats are completely dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>2. Are all rice cereals gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Not all rice cereals are gluten-free. Some may contain malt flavoring or other gluten-containing ingredients. Always check the label and look for a certified gluten-free product.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I add other ingredients to my rice crispy treats?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can customize your rice crispy treats by adding ingredients like chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruit. Just make sure that any additional ingredients are also gluten and dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>4. How should I store my rice crispy treats?</h3>
        <p>Store your rice crispy treats in an airtight container at room temperature. They should stay fresh for up to 3 days. If you live in a humid environment, you may want to store them in the refrigerator to prevent them from becoming too sticky.</p>
