    <h1>Gluten-Free Polvorones: A Delicious and Healthy Treat</h1>
    <p>Polvorones, also known as Mexican wedding cookies or Spanish shortbread, are a beloved treat enjoyed by many around the world. Traditionally made with wheat flour, these crumbly, melt-in-your-mouth cookies have been a staple in many cultures for centuries. However, with the rise of gluten intolerance and celiac disease, there has been a growing demand for gluten-free alternatives. Enter gluten-free polvorones—a delicious and healthy option that allows everyone to enjoy this classic treat without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>What Are Polvorones?</h2>
    <p>Polvorones are a type of shortbread cookie that originated in Spain and have since become popular in various forms across Latin America and the Philippines. The name "polvorón" comes from the Spanish word "polvo," meaning powder, which refers to the cookie's crumbly texture. Traditionally, polvorones are made with flour, sugar, butter, and nuts, often flavored with cinnamon or vanilla. They are typically rolled in powdered sugar, giving them their signature snowy appearance.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to improve their health and well-being. Gluten-free polvorones offer a safe and delicious alternative for those who need or choose to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Polvorones</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free polvorones is easier than you might think. The key is to use gluten-free flour blends that mimic the texture of traditional wheat flour. Here are the essential ingredients you'll need:</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Polvorones</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free polvorones is a straightforward process that yields delicious results. Follow these steps to create your own batch:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, powdered sugar, ground cinnamon, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream the softened butter until it's light and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract and mix until combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until a dough forms. If you're using nuts, fold them in at this stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the cookies:</strong> Scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of dough and roll them into balls. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the cookies for 12-15 minutes, or until they are lightly golden around the edges. Be careful not to overbake, as they can become too crumbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and roll in sugar:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet, then roll them in powdered sugar while they're still warm. Let them cool completely before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Polvorones</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free polvorones turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking and has a fine texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough if necessary:</strong> If the dough is too soft to handle, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before shaping the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Gluten-free polvorones can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. For longer storage, freeze the cookies and thaw them at room temperature before serving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Polvorones</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, almond flour can be used as a substitute, but it will change the texture and flavor of the cookies. Almond flour tends to be denser and nuttier, so you may need to adjust the recipe accordingly.</p>

        <h3>2. Are gluten-free polvorones suitable for people with nut allergies?</h3>
        <p>If you have a nut allergy, you can omit the nuts from the recipe. Be sure to check the ingredients in your gluten-free flour blend to ensure it doesn't contain any nut-based flours.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make gluten-free polvorones vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make vegan gluten-free polvorones by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan margarine. Just make sure the substitute has a similar consistency to butter.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I prevent my gluten-free polvorones from being too crumbly?</h3>
        <p>To prevent the cookies from being too crumbly, make sure not to overbake them. Additionally, using a gluten-free flour blend that includes xanthan gum can help improve the texture.</p>
