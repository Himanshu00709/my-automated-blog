<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free chocolate chip oatmeal bars:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang for easy removal.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free rolled oats, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
    <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream together the unsalted butter (or coconut oil) and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg (or flax egg) and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in the dark chocolate chips.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the bars to cool completely in the pan before lifting them out using the parchment paper overhang. Cut into squares and serve.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use regular oats instead of gluten-free oats?</h3>
    <p>While regular oats are naturally gluten-free, they are often processed in facilities that handle gluten-containing grains, which can lead to cross-contamination. If you have celiac disease or a severe gluten sensitivity, it's best to use certified gluten-free oats.</p>

    <h3>Can I substitute almond flour with another type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours such as coconut flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>How should I store these bars?</h3>
    <p>Store the bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I add other mix-ins to the bars?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Feel free to customize your bars by adding nuts, dried fruits, or even a drizzle of peanut butter on top.</p>
