    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Vegan Biscuits</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free vegan biscuits is easier than you might think. Start by preheating your oven to 425°F (220°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of gluten-free flour blend, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda. Cut in 1/2 cup of cold vegan butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add 3/4 cup of almond milk or soy milk, stirring until the dough comes together. Roll out the dough on a floured surface and cut out biscuits using a round cutter. Place the biscuits on a baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Vegan Gravy</h2>

    <p>While the biscuits are baking, you can prepare the vegan gravy. In a saucepan, melt 1/4 cup of vegan butter over medium heat. Whisk in 1/4 cup of gluten-free flour blend and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly. Gradually add 2 cups of vegetable broth, whisking continuously to prevent lumps. Stir in 1/4 cup of nutritional yeast, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of paprika. Cook the gravy until it thickens, then season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>

    <p>Once the biscuits are done, split them in half and spoon the warm gravy over the top. You can also add a side of sautéed greens or a fresh salad to round out the meal. For an extra touch of indulgence, consider adding a dollop of vegan sour cream or a sprinkle of chopped chives.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Vegan Biscuits and Gravy</h2>

    <p>This gluten-free vegan version of biscuits and gravy is not only delicious but also packed with health benefits. The gluten-free flour blend provides a good source of fiber, which can aid in digestion and promote gut health. Nutritional yeast is rich in B vitamins, which are essential for energy production and brain function. Additionally, using plant-based milk and butter reduces the intake of saturated fats, making this dish heart-healthy.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. However, keep in mind that different flours may affect the texture of the biscuits. A blend of rice flour, almond flour, and tapioca starch works well for a light and fluffy texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the gravy ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! The gravy can be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Simply reheat it on the stove or in the microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of nutritional yeast?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have nutritional yeast, you can use a small amount of miso paste or a sprinkle of vegan cheese for a similar savory flavor.</p>

        <h3>Are these biscuits freezer-friendly?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked biscuits for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply place them in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for 10-15 minutes, or until warmed through.</p>
