<h2>How to Make a Gluten-Free Vegan Roast</h2>

<p>Making a gluten-free vegan roast is easier than you might think. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating your own:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong> Start by cooking your legumes and grains. If you're using lentils, cook them until they're tender but not mushy.

    <li><strong>Mix the Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the cooked legumes, grains, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Add your choice of spices and herbs, and mix well. You can also add a binding agent like flaxseed meal mixed with water to help hold the roast together.</li>
