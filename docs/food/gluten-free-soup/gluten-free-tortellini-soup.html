    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free tortellini soup is a straightforward process that yields a delicious and comforting meal. Follow these steps to create your own batch of this hearty soup:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Vegetables:</strong> Start by heating the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion, minced garlic, sliced carrots, and celery. Sauté the vegetables until they are tender, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Broth and Tomatoes:</strong> Once the vegetables are tender, pour in the vegetable or chicken broth and the diced tomatoes. Stir to combine, then bring the mixture to a gentle boil.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the Soup:</strong> Add the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper to the pot. Stir well to ensure the seasonings are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Tortellini:</strong> Add the gluten-free tortellini to the pot and cook according to the package instructions, usually about 7-10 minutes. Be sure not to overcook the tortellini, as it can become mushy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Spinach:</strong> In the last few minutes of cooking, stir in the fresh spinach. The spinach will wilt quickly, adding a burst of color and nutrients to the soup.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Once the tortellini is cooked and the spinach is wilted, remove the pot from the heat. Ladle the soup into bowls and serve hot. You can garnish with grated Parmesan cheese or fresh herbs if desired.</li>
