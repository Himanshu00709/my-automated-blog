    <h2>Step-by-Step Cooking Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get cooking! Follow these steps to create a delicious gluten-free tortellini soup:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Vegetables</h3>

    <p>Start by heating the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion, minced garlic, sliced carrots, and celery. Saut√© the vegetables for about 5-7 minutes, or until they begin to soften. This step is crucial as it helps to build the flavor base of the soup.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Broth and Tomatoes</h3>

    <p>Once the vegetables are softened, pour in the vegetable or chicken broth and the can of diced tomatoes. Stir well to combine. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Tortellini</h3>

    <p>Add the gluten-free tortellini to the pot and cook according to the package instructions. This usually takes about 8-10 minutes. Be careful not to overcook the tortellini, as it can become mushy. Stir occasionally to prevent the pasta from sticking to the bottom of the pot.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Spinach and Seasonings</h3>

    <p>Once the tortellini is cooked, stir in the fresh spinach and Italian seasoning. The spinach will wilt quickly, so this step should only take a couple of minutes. Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with freshly grated Parmesan cheese if desired. Serve hot and enjoy the comforting flavors of your gluten-free tortellini soup!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Tortellini Soup</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use frozen gluten-free tortellini?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen gluten-free tortellini. Just make sure to adjust the cooking time according to the package instructions, as frozen tortellini may take a bit longer to cook.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make this soup ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>While you can prepare the soup ahead of time, it's best to add the tortellini just before serving to prevent it from becoming too soft. Store the soup (without the tortellini) in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, then reheat and add the tortellini when ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>3. What can I substitute for spinach?</h3>
        <p>If you're not a fan of spinach, you can substitute it with other leafy greens like kale, Swiss chard, or even arugula. Just keep in mind that the cooking time may vary slightly depending on the greens you choose.</p>

        <h3>4. Is this soup freezer-friendly?</h3>
        <p>This soup can be frozen, but it's best to freeze it without the tortellini. The pasta can become mushy when thawed and reheated. To freeze, let the soup cool completely, then transfer it to an airtight container and freeze for up to 3 months. When ready to eat, thaw the soup in the refrigerator overnight, reheat on the stove, and add freshly cooked tortellini.</p>
