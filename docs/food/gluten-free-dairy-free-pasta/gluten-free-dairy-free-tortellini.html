    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Tortellini at Home</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free dairy-free tortellini at home may seem daunting, but with the right ingredients and techniques, it can be a rewarding culinary adventure. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating your own:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend (e.g., rice flour, almond flour, or chickpea flour)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup dairy-free filling (e.g., cashew cheese, tofu ricotta, or sautéed vegetables)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, water, olive oil, and salt. Mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Using a rolling pin or pasta machine, roll the dough into thin sheets. Aim for a thickness of about 1/8 inch.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut the Dough:</strong> Use a round cookie cutter or a glass to cut the dough into small circles, approximately 2-3 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Filling:</strong> Place a small amount of your chosen dairy-free filling in the center of each dough circle.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Tortellini:</strong> Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, then press the edges to seal. Bring the two ends of the half-moon together and pinch to form the classic tortellini shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Tortellini:</strong> Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the tortellini and cook for 3-5 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain and serve with your favorite sauce.</li>
