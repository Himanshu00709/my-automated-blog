    <h1>Dried Cranberries: A Gluten-Free Superfood</h1>
    <p>Dried cranberries are a popular snack and ingredient in many dishes, known for their sweet-tart flavor and numerous health benefits. For individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, finding gluten-free foods is essential. Fortunately, dried cranberries are naturally gluten-free, making them a safe and nutritious option for those avoiding gluten. In this article, we will explore the benefits of dried cranberries, their gluten-free status, and how to incorporate them into your diet.</p>

    <h2>What Are Dried Cranberries?</h2>
    <p>Dried cranberries are made by dehydrating fresh cranberries, which removes most of their water content. This process concentrates their natural sugars, resulting in a sweet and tangy flavor.

Dried cranberries are versatile and can be used in a variety of dishes, from salads and baked goods to trail mixes and cereals.</p>

    <h2>Are Dried Cranberries Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Yes, dried cranberries are naturally gluten-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and since cranberries are a fruit, they do not contain gluten. However, it is important to check the packaging for any potential cross-contamination or added ingredients that may contain gluten. Some brands may process dried cranberries in facilities that also handle gluten-containing products, so always look for a gluten-free certification on the label to ensure safety.</p>
