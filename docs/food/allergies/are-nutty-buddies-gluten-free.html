<p>As you can see, the primary ingredient in Nutty Buddies is enriched wheat flour, which contains gluten. This immediately raises a red flag for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

<h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination</h2>

<p>Little Debbie, the manufacturer of Nutty Buddies, does not claim that Nutty Buddies are gluten-free. Additionally, they produce other products that contain gluten in the same facilities. This increases the risk of cross-contamination, making Nutty Buddies unsuitable for those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <li><strong>Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Cups:</strong> Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups are gluten-free and provide a similar combination of peanut butter and chocolate.</li>
    <li><strong>Homemade Gluten-Free Nutty Buddies:</strong> If you enjoy baking, you can make your own gluten-free version using gluten-free wafer cookies, peanut butter, and melted chocolate.</li>
</ul>
