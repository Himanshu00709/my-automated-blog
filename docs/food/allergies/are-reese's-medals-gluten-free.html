<h1>Are Reese's Medals Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, navigating the world of sweets can be a challenge. Reese's Medals, a popular treat from the Reese's brand, are a favorite among chocolate and peanut butter lovers. But are they safe for those avoiding gluten? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the ingredients, manufacturing processes, and potential cross-contamination risks to determine whether Reese's Medals are gluten-free.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial to scrutinize the ingredients and production processes of any food product, including candies like Reese's Medals.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in Reese's Medals</h2>

<p>To determine if Reese's Medals are gluten-free, let’s first examine their ingredients. According to the official Reese's website, the primary ingredients in Reese's Medals include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Milk Chocolate (Sugar, Cocoa Butter, Chocolate, Nonfat Milk, Milk Fat, Lactose, Soy Lecithin, PGPR)</li>
    <li>Peanuts</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Dextrose</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>TBHQ (Preservative)</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, none of these ingredients contain gluten. However, it’s important to consider potential cross-contamination during manufacturing.</p>

<h2>Manufacturing Process and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

<p>Even if a product’s ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. This happens when gluten-free products are produced in facilities that also handle gluten-containing ingredients. Reese's Medals are manufactured by The Hershey Company, which produces a wide range of products, some of which contain gluten.</p>

<p>According to Hershey’s, they have strict protocols in place to prevent cross-contamination. However, they do not label Reese's Medals as gluten-free. This means that while the ingredients themselves do not contain gluten, there is a possibility of trace amounts of gluten due to shared equipment or facilities.</p>

<h2>Are Reese's Medals Safe for Celiac Patients?</h2>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease, even trace amounts of gluten can trigger a reaction. While Reese's Medals do not contain gluten ingredients, the risk of cross-contamination means they may not be entirely safe for those with celiac disease. It’s always best to consult with a healthcare provider or dietitian before consuming products that are not explicitly labeled as gluten-free.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Alternatives to Reese's Medals</h2>

<p>If you’re looking for a gluten-free alternative to Reese's Medals, there are several options available. Many brands offer gluten-free chocolate and peanut butter candies that are produced in dedicated gluten-free facilities. Some popular alternatives include:</p>
