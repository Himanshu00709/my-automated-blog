    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial for these individuals to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and production processes of the foods they consume.</p>

But when it comes to dietary restrictions, particularly gluten-free diets, how does Mr. Softee stack up?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Mr. Softee Products</h2>

    <p>To determine whether Mr. Softee products are gluten-free, we need to examine the ingredients used in their soft-serve ice cream and other offerings. The primary ingredients in Mr. Softee soft-serve ice cream include:</p>

        <li>Stabilizers and Emulsifiers</li>
    </ul>
