    <h1>Is Freddy's Custard Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers is a popular fast-food chain known for its delicious custard and steakburgers. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether Freddy's custard is gluten-free is of utmost importance. In this article, we will delve into the details of Freddy's custard ingredients, preparation methods, and potential cross-contamination risks to help you make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it is crucial for those affected to carefully scrutinize the ingredients and preparation methods of the foods they consume.</p>

    <h2>Freddy's Custard Ingredients</h2>

    <p>Freddy's custard is made from a few simple ingredients: milk, cream, sugar, and egg yolks. These ingredients are naturally gluten-free. However, the key concern for those with gluten intolerance is the potential for cross-contamination during the preparation process. Let's take a closer look at the ingredients:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Milk</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cream</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sugar</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Potential Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>While the ingredients in Freddy's custard are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the preparation process. For example, if the same equipment is used to prepare gluten-containing products, there is a risk of gluten particles contaminating the custard. Additionally, toppings and mix-ins, such as cookies or brownies, may contain gluten and could be added to the custard.</p>

    <p>Freddy's does not have a dedicated gluten-free preparation area, which increases the risk of cross-contamination. Therefore, individuals with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease should exercise caution when consuming Freddy's custard.</p>
