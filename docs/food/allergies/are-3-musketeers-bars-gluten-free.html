While Mars, Inc. takes precautions to prevent cross-contamination, they do not certify their products as gluten-free.</p>

        <li><strong>Contact Manufacturers:</strong> If you’re unsure about a product’s gluten-free status, reach out to the manufacturer for clarification.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Shared Equipment:</strong> Be cautious of products that are processed on shared equipment with gluten-containing foods.</li>
