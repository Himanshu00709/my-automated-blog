    <p>From the table above, it’s clear that the primary ingredients in Snickers Ice Cream Bars do not contain gluten. However, it’s important to note that the absence of gluten-containing ingredients does not automatically guarantee that the product is gluten-free. Cross-contamination during manufacturing is a potential concern.</p>

    <h2>Manufacturing and Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>Even if a product’s ingredients are gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the manufacturing process. This is especially true in facilities that produce multiple products, some of which may contain gluten. For Snickers Ice Cream Bars, the risk of cross-contamination depends on the manufacturing practices of the company producing them.</p>

    <p>Mars, Inc., the company behind Snickers, has stated that they take allergen control seriously and have strict protocols in place to prevent cross-contamination. However, they also note that their facilities handle a variety of ingredients, including those that contain gluten. As a result, they do not label Snickers Ice Cream Bars as gluten-free.</p>

    <p>For individuals with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, this lack of a gluten-free label may be a red flag. It’s always a good idea to contact the manufacturer directly if you have concerns about cross-contamination.</p>
