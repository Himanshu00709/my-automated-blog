    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Pasta</h3>
    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the gluten-free pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Cheese Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in the cornstarch or rice flour to create a roux. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the mixture is smooth and bubbly.</p>

    <p>Gradually add the milk, whisking continuously to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook until it thickens, about 3-5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the shredded Gouda and cheddar cheese until fully melted and smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Pasta and Sauce</h3>
    <p>Add the cooked pasta to the cheese sauce, stirring until the pasta is evenly coated. If desired, transfer the mixture to a baking dish and top with gluten-free breadcrumbs for a crispy finish.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake (Optional)</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). If you’ve added breadcrumbs, bake the mac and cheese for 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly. Serve hot and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Gouda Mac and Cheese</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use other cheeses besides Gouda?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While Gouda adds a unique flavor, you can substitute it with other cheeses like smoked cheddar, fontina, or even a blend of your favorites. Just make sure the cheeses melt well for a smooth sauce.</p>

        <h3>2. Is gluten-free pasta as good as regular pasta?</h3>
        <p>Modern gluten-free pasta options are incredibly close in texture and taste to traditional pasta. Look for brands made from rice, corn, or quinoa for the best results.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this dish dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use dairy-free cheese and plant-based milk to create a vegan version of this recipe. Just ensure the cheese melts well and the milk is unsweetened for the best flavor.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave or oven, adding a splash of milk to restore creaminess.</p>
    </div>

With its rich, creamy sauce and perfectly cooked pasta, this dish is sure to become a favorite in your household.
