<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Candied Walnuts</h3>
<p>Start by making the candied walnuts. In a small saucepan, combine 1/4 cup of sugar with 1/4 cup of water. Bring to a boil, then add the walnuts. Stir continuously until the sugar crystallizes and coats the walnuts. Spread them on a baking sheet to cool.</p>

<h3>2. Coat and Fry the Shrimp</h3>
<p>In a bowl, mix the gluten-free flour and cornstarch. Dip each shrimp into the beaten egg, then coat with the flour mixture. Heat vegetable oil in a pan and fry the shrimp until golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</p>

<h3>3. Make the Honey Sauce</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the honey, mayonnaise, condensed milk (if using), and gluten-free soy sauce. Adjust the sweetness and creaminess to your preference.</p>

<h3>4. Assemble the Dish</h3>
<p>Toss the fried shrimp in the honey sauce until evenly coated. Serve immediately, garnished with the candied walnuts. Pair with steamed rice or a fresh salad for a complete meal.</p>
