    <h1>Gluten-Free Beef Wellington: A Culinary Masterpiece</h1>

    <p>Beef Wellington is a classic dish that has graced the tables of fine dining establishments for decades. Traditionally, this dish consists of a tender beef fillet coated with pâté and duxelles, then wrapped in puff pastry and baked to perfection. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, the traditional recipe poses a challenge due to the use of wheat-based puff pastry. Enter the gluten-free Beef Wellington—a dish that retains all the elegance and flavor of the original while catering to dietary restrictions. In this article, we’ll explore how to create a gluten-free Beef Wellington that is both delicious and visually stunning.</p>

Regardless of its history, Beef Wellington has become synonymous with luxury and sophistication, making it a popular choice for special occasions.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Beef</h3>
    <p>Start by seasoning the beef tenderloin generously with salt and pepper. Sear the beef in a hot skillet with a bit of oil until it is browned on all sides. This step locks in the juices and adds a rich flavor to the meat. Once seared, brush the beef with Dijon mustard and set it aside to cool.</p>

    <h3>2. Making the Duxelles</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, sauté the finely chopped mushrooms, shallots, and garlic until the mixture is dry and all the moisture has evaporated. This mixture, known as duxelles, will add a deep, earthy flavor to the Beef Wellington. Allow the duxelles to cool completely before proceeding.</p>

    <h3>3. Assembling the Wellington</h3>
    <p>Lay out a sheet of gluten-free puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Spread a thin layer of the cooled duxelles over the pastry. Next, lay the slices of prosciutto over the duxelles, ensuring that they overlap slightly. Place the seared beef tenderloin in the center and carefully wrap the pastry around the beef, sealing the edges with the beaten egg wash.</p>

    <h3>4. Baking the Wellington</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Transfer the wrapped Beef Wellington to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the entire surface of the pastry with the remaining egg wash to achieve a golden, glossy finish. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the internal temperature of the beef reaches 125°F (52°C) for medium-rare. Allow the Wellington to rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make the gluten-free puff pastry from scratch?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make gluten-free puff pastry from scratch using a combination of gluten-free flours, such as rice flour and tapioca starch. However, this process can be time-consuming, so many people opt for store-bought gluten-free puff pastry for convenience.</p>

        <h3>What can I serve with gluten-free Beef Wellington?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free Beef Wellington pairs beautifully with a variety of side dishes, such as roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh green salad. For a complete meal, consider serving it with a gluten-free gravy or sauce.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftover Beef Wellington can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, place the slices in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10-15 minutes, or until warmed through.</p>
