    <h2>How to Make a Gluten-Free Bread Bowl at Home</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free bread bowl at home is easier than you might think. With the right ingredients and a bit of patience, you can create a delicious and healthy bread bowl that rivals any store-bought version. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend (e.g., almond flour, coconut flour, or rice flour)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon xanthan gum (if not included in your flour blend)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110°F)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 egg (for egg wash)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, salt, and sugar. Mix well.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a ball. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife, cut a circle into the top of each dough ball, leaving about 1/2 inch around the edges. Gently remove the top to create a bowl shape.</li>
        <li>Brush the outside of each bread bowl with egg wash.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until the bread bowls are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped.</li>
        <li>Let the bread bowls cool slightly before filling them with your favorite soup, dip, or salad.</li>
    </ol>
