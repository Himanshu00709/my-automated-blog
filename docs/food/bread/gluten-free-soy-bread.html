<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Soy Bread at Home</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free soy bread at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups soy flour</li>
    <li>1 cup tapioca flour</li>
    <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon xanthan gum</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup</li>
    <li>1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>3 eggs (or flax eggs for a vegan option)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the soy flour, tapioca flour, almond flour, xanthan gum, and salt.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
    <li>Add the honey (or maple syrup), olive oil, and eggs to the yeast mixture and whisk until well combined.</li>
    <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. The dough will be sticky, but that’s normal.</li>
    <li>Transfer the dough to a greased loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula.</li>
    <li>Cover the pan with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the bread for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
</ol>
