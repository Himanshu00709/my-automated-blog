    <p>Making gluten-free pretzel buns at home is easier than you might think. With the right ingredients and a bit of patience, you can create delicious, chewy buns that rival their gluten-containing counterparts. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>1 tsp xanthan gum (if not included in your flour blend)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 packet instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup baking soda</li>
        <li>1 egg (for egg wash)</li>
        <li>Coarse sea salt (for topping)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, salt, sugar, and instant yeast.</li>
        <li>Add the warm water and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add the baking soda.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 6 equal portions and shape them into buns. Carefully drop each bun into the boiling water for about 30 seconds, then remove and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Brush the tops of the buns with an egg wash and sprinkle with coarse sea salt.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the buns are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Allow the buns to cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
