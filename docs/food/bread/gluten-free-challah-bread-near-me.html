<h1>Gluten-Free Challah Bread Near Me: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Gluten-free challah bread is often enriched with eggs, honey, and oil, just like its traditional counterpart, giving it a similar rich and slightly sweet flavor. The braiding technique used in traditional challah can also be applied to gluten-free versions, making it a visually stunning addition to any meal.</p>

<p>If you’re feeling adventurous, you can try making gluten-free challah bread at home. While it may seem daunting, with the right ingredients and a bit of patience, you can create a delicious loaf that rivals any store-bought version. Here’s a basic recipe to get you started:</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend (such as rice flour, almond flour, or a pre-mixed blend)</li>
    <li>1 tsp xanthan gum (if not included in your flour blend)</li>
    <li>1 packet active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1/4 cup warm water</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
    <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt.</li>
    <li>Add the yeast mixture, eggs, honey, and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.</li>
    <li>Once the dough has risen, divide it into three equal parts and roll each part into a long rope. Braid the ropes together and place the braided loaf on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Brush the loaf with an egg wash (1 egg beaten with 1 tbsp water) and let it rise for another 15-20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Bake the challah for 25-30 minutes or until it is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.</li>
    <li>Let the bread cool before slicing and serving.</li>
</ol>
