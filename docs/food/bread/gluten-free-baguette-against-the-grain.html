    <h1>Gluten-Free Baguette: A Revolution Against the Grain</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the general desire for healthier eating options. Among the many gluten-free alternatives available today, the gluten-free baguette stands out as a culinary marvel.
