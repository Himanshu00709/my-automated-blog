    <h2>What Are Ancient Grains?</h2>

        <li><strong>Millet</strong>: A versatile grain that is rich in magnesium and antioxidants.</li>
        <li><strong>Teff</strong>: A tiny grain that is high in calcium and iron, commonly used in Ethiopian cuisine.</li>
        <li><strong>Buckwheat</strong>: Despite its name, buckwheat is not related to wheat and is naturally gluten-free.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These grains are not only gluten-free but also packed with essential nutrients, making them an excellent choice for those looking to improve their diet.</p>

    <p>As you can see, ancient grain bread is not only a safe option for those with gluten sensitivities but also a nutrient-dense food that can contribute to overall health and well-being.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Ancient Grain Bread for a Gluten-Free Diet?</h2>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, finding a bread that is both safe to eat and enjoyable can be a challenge. Many gluten-free breads on the market are made with refined flours and lack the nutritional value of whole grains. Ancient grain bread, on the other hand, offers a wholesome alternative that is both gluten-free and nutrient-rich.</p>

    <p>Here are some reasons why ancient grain bread is an excellent choice for a gluten-free diet:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rich in Fiber</strong>: Ancient grains are high in dietary fiber, which is essential for digestive health. Fiber helps to regulate bowel movements, prevent constipation, and support a healthy gut microbiome.</li>
        <li><strong>High in Protein</strong>: Many ancient grains, such as quinoa and amaranth, are excellent sources of plant-based protein. This makes ancient grain bread a great option for vegetarians and vegans.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Glycemic Index</strong>: Ancient grains have a lower glycemic index compared to refined grains, meaning they cause a slower and more gradual rise in blood sugar levels. This is particularly beneficial for individuals with diabetes or those looking to manage their weight.</li>
        <li><strong>Packed with Antioxidants</strong>: Ancient grains are rich in antioxidants, which help to combat oxidative stress and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer.</li>
    </ul>
