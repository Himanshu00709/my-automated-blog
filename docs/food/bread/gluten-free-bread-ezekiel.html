<h1>Gluten-Free Ezekiel Bread: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the desire for healthier eating habits. Among the many gluten-free options available, Ezekiel bread has gained significant attention. But what exactly is Ezekiel bread, and how does it fit into a gluten-free diet? In this article, we’ll explore the origins, benefits, and nutritional profile of gluten-free Ezekiel bread, and why it might be the perfect addition to your diet.</p>

<h2>What is Ezekiel Bread?</h2>

<p>Ezekiel bread is a type of sprouted grain bread that is inspired by a biblical passage from the Book of Ezekiel. The original recipe includes a combination of sprouted grains and legumes, such as wheat, barley, lentils, and millet. However, traditional Ezekiel bread contains gluten, which makes it unsuitable for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

<p>To cater to the gluten-free market, many brands have developed gluten-free versions of Ezekiel bread. These versions typically use a blend of gluten-free grains and seeds, such as quinoa, amaranth, and chia seeds, to replicate the nutritional benefits of the original recipe without the gluten.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Ezekiel Bread</h2>
