    <h1>Gluten-Free Sweet Hawaiian Rolls: A Delicious Twist on a Classic</h1>

    <p>When it comes to comfort food, few things can rival the soft, pillowy texture and sweet flavor of Hawaiian rolls. These delightful buns have been a staple at family gatherings, holiday feasts, and casual dinners for decades. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying traditional Hawaiian rolls has often been off the table—until now.

    <h2>What Makes Hawaiian Rolls So Special?</h2>

The secret to their unique flavor lies in the combination of pineapple juice, honey, and a touch of vanilla. These ingredients not only add sweetness but also contribute to the rolls' moist and tender crumb. Traditionally, Hawaiian rolls are made with wheat flour, which contains gluten. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets, bakers have found innovative ways to recreate this beloved treat using gluten-free flours and binders.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Sweet Hawaiian Rolls at Home</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free Hawaiian rolls at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create these delicious buns in your own kitchen:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by combining your gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and yeast in a large mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together warm pineapple juice, honey, melted butter, and eggs. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms. Knead the dough gently until it becomes smooth and elastic.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Let the Dough Rise</h3>
    <p>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size. This step is crucial for developing the rolls' light and airy texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Rolls</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, divide it into equal portions and shape each portion into a ball. Place the balls in a greased baking dish, leaving a little space between each roll to allow for expansion during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Brush the tops of the rolls with melted butter for a golden finish. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the rolls are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped. Let them cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Sweet Hawaiian Rolls</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use store-bought gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a store-bought gluten-free flour blend. However, make sure it contains a mix of flours and starches (like rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch) for the best texture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
