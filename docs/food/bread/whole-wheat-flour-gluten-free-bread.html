        <h3>1. Is whole wheat flour gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>No, traditional whole wheat flour contains gluten. However, gluten-free whole grain flours, such as brown rice flour or quinoa flour, can be used to make gluten-free bread.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I use almond flour instead of brown rice flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, almond flour can be used as a substitute, but it will alter the texture and flavor of the bread. Almond flour is denser and has a nuttier taste.</p>

        <h3>3. How do I store gluten-free bread?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free bread tends to dry out faster than traditional bread. Store it in an airtight container or wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. For longer storage, freeze the bread and thaw slices as needed.</p>

        <h3>4. Why is xanthan gum used in gluten-free baking?</h3>
