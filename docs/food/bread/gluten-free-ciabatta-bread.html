    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Ciabatta Bread</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free ciabatta bread at home is a rewarding process. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you achieve the perfect loaf:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine your gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, yeast, and salt. Gradually add warm water and olive oil, mixing until a sticky dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Dough Rise:</strong> Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Once risen, gently shape the dough into a rectangular loaf on a floured surface. Be careful not to deflate the dough too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Rise:</strong> Transfer the shaped dough to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Let it rise for another 30-45 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Bake the ciabatta for 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when tapped.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow the bread to cool on a wire rack before slicing and serving.</li>
