    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free cranberry walnut bread is a straightforward process, but it's important to follow the steps carefully to ensure the best results. Here's how to do it:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan and line it with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until light and frothy. Add the applesauce, honey (or maple syrup), and milk, and mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense loaf.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fold in Cranberries and Walnuts</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the dried cranberries and chopped walnuts, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve as desired.</p>
