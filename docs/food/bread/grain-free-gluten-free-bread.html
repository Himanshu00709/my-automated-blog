    <li><strong>Nutrient-Dense:</strong> Many grain-free flours, such as almond flour and coconut flour, are rich in essential nutrients like protein, healthy fats, and fiber.</li>
    <li><strong>Low Glycemic Index:</strong> Grain-free bread often has a lower glycemic index compared to traditional bread, making it a better option for those managing blood sugar levels.</li>
