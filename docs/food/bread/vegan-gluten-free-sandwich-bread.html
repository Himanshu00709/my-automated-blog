<h2>How to Make Vegan Gluten-Free Sandwich Bread at Home</h2>

<p>Making your own vegan gluten-free sandwich bread is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients</h3>
<p>Before you begin, ensure you have all the necessary ingredients. A typical recipe might include gluten-free flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, plant-based milk, apple cider vinegar, and a sweetener like maple syrup.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure they’re evenly distributed.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, mix the plant-based milk, apple cider vinegar, and maple syrup. The vinegar helps activate the baking powder, giving the bread a better rise.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a thick dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can affect the texture of the bread.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake the Bread</h3>
<p>Transfer the dough to a greased loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Cool and Slice</h3>
<p>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and enjoy!</p>

<h2>FAQs About Vegan Gluten-Free Sandwich Bread</h2>

</div>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>3. Why does my gluten-free bread crumble?</h3>

</div>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>4. Can I make this bread without a loaf pan?</h3>

</div>
