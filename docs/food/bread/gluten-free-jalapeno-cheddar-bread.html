    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making this delicious bread:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan and set it aside. This will ensure that your bread doesn't stick to the pan and comes out easily after baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Make sure the ingredients are well combined to ensure an even texture in your bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk and melted butter. Mix until well combined. This mixture will help bind the dry ingredients together and add moisture to the bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense loaf. Fold in the chopped jalapeños and shredded cheddar cheese until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The bread should be golden brown on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve as desired. This bread is perfect for sandwiches, toast, or simply enjoyed on its own.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>

    <p>Here are a few tips to ensure your gluten-free jalapeño cheddar bread turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking bread and contains xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense loaf. Mix until just combined to ensure a light and airy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the spice level:</strong> If you prefer a milder bread, remove the seeds from the jalapeños. For a spicier loaf, leave some or all of the seeds in.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with cheese:</strong> While cheddar is classic, feel free to experiment with other types of cheese, such as pepper jack or mozzarella, for a different flavor profile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this bread dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this bread dairy-free by using a non-dairy milk alternative, such as almond or oat milk, and a dairy-free cheese substitute. Be sure to check the labels to ensure they are gluten-free as well.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, wrap the bread tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other ingredients to the bread?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Feel free to customize the bread by adding other ingredients, such as cooked bacon, green onions, or even a sprinkle of garlic powder for extra flavor.</p>

        <h3>Is this bread suitable for people with celiac disease?</h3>
        <p>Yes, as long as all ingredients used are certified gluten-free and there is no risk of cross-contamination, this bread is suitable for people with celiac disease.</p>
