    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a loaf pan and set it aside. This will ensure that your bread doesn't stick to the pan and comes out easily after baking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure they are evenly distributed. This step is crucial for achieving a uniform texture in your bread.</p>

    <h3>3. Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and melted butter. Make sure the mixture is well combined before adding it to the dry ingredients. This will help create a smooth batter.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Jalapeños and Cheese</h3>
    <p>Fold in the finely chopped jalapeños and shredded cheddar cheese into the batter. Be sure to mix evenly so that every bite of bread has a bit of spice and cheesy goodness.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free jalapeño cheddar bread is incredibly versatile. Here are a few ways you can enjoy it:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>As a Side:</strong> Serve it alongside a bowl of soup or chili for a comforting meal.</li>
        <li><strong>Sandwiches:</strong> Use it to make a grilled cheese sandwich or a turkey and avocado sandwich.</li>
