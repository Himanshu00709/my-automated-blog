    </table>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Activate the Yeast:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the warm milk and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, whisk together the eggs and melted butter. Add the activated yeast mixture and stir to combine.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dough:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. The dough will be sticky, but that’s normal for gluten-free bread.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Dough Rise:</strong> Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Once the dough has risen, transfer it to a greased loaf pan. Smooth the top with a spatula or your hands.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Rise:</strong> Cover the loaf pan with a towel and let the dough rise again for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the bread for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Milk Bread</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use any type of milk for gluten-free milk bread?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any type of milk, including dairy milk, almond milk, soy milk, or oat milk. Just make sure the milk is warm (not hot) to activate the yeast properly.</p>

        <h3>2. Do I need to use xanthan gum in gluten-free milk bread?</h3>
        <p>Xanthan gum is often used in gluten-free baking to help mimic the elasticity and structure that gluten provides. If your gluten-free flour blend already contains xanthan gum, you may not need to add extra. However, if it doesn’t, adding 1 tsp of xanthan gum is recommended.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store gluten-free milk bread?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free bread tends to dry out faster than traditional bread. Store it in an airtight container or plastic bag at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the bread for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make gluten-free milk bread without eggs?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make gluten-free milk bread without eggs by using egg substitutes like flax eggs or commercial egg replacers. However, the texture may be slightly different.</p>
