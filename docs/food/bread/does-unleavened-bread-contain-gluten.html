    <h1>Does Unleavened Bread Contain Gluten? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Unleavened bread has been a staple in many cultures for centuries. From matzo in Jewish traditions to roti in South Asian cuisine, this simple bread is celebrated for its simplicity and versatility. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether unleavened bread contains gluten is crucial. In this article, we’ll explore the relationship between unleavened bread and gluten, its nutritional implications, and alternatives for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>What is Unleavened Bread?</h2>
    <p>Unleavened bread is a type of bread made without leavening agents such as yeast, baking powder, or baking soda. This results in a flat, dense bread that is often quick to prepare. Common examples include matzo, tortillas, and chapati. The absence of leavening agents gives unleavened bread its characteristic texture and makes it a popular choice in religious and cultural practices.</p>

    <h2>Does Unleavened Bread Contain Gluten?</h2>
    <p>The gluten content in unleavened bread depends on the type of flour used. Traditional unleavened bread is made from wheat flour, which contains gluten. Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat, barley, and rye that gives dough its elasticity and helps it rise. Therefore, most unleavened bread made from wheat flour does contain gluten.</p>

    <p>However, there are gluten-free alternatives available. For example, unleavened bread can be made from gluten-free flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or chickpea flour. These options are safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>
