    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.

Going gluten-free is not just a trend; for many, it's a necessity. Nature's Own Gluten-Free Bread provides a safe and tasty option for those who need to avoid gluten without sacrificing the joy of eating bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients and Nutritional Value</h2>

    <p>Nature's Own Gluten-Free Bread is made with a blend of gluten-free flours, including rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch.
