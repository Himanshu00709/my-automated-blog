    <h2>How to Make Unleavened Gluten-Free Bread</h2>

    <p>Making unleavened gluten-free bread is straightforward and requires minimal equipment. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine your chosen gluten-free flour with a pinch of salt. If you’re using any optional add-ins like herbs or seeds, mix them in at this stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Wet Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add water or milk to the dry ingredients, stirring continuously until a dough forms. The dough should be firm but pliable. If it’s too dry, add a little more liquid; if it’s too wet, add a bit more flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. This helps to develop the texture of the bread.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Roll the dough out into your desired shape, whether it’s a flatbread, a round loaf, or individual rolls. You can also use a rolling pin to achieve an even thickness.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Bread:</strong> Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with oil. Cook the bread for a few minutes on each side until it’s golden brown and cooked through. Alternatively, you can bake the bread in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the bread to cool slightly before serving. It can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
