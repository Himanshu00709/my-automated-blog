    <h1>Gluten-Free Hoagie Buns: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular over the years, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference. One of the challenges of maintaining a gluten-free lifestyle is finding suitable substitutes for everyday foods, such as bread. Hoagie buns, a staple for sandwiches and subs, are no exception. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free hoagie buns, from their ingredients to their benefits, and even how to make them at home.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Hoagie Buns?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free hoagie buns are a type of bread specifically designed to be free from gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Traditional hoagie buns are made with wheat flour, which gives them their characteristic texture and elasticity. However, gluten-free versions use alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca starch to achieve a similar texture without the gluten.</p>

    <p>These buns are ideal for individuals who need to avoid gluten but still want to enjoy their favorite sandwiches, subs, or hoagies. They are often fortified with additional nutrients to make up for the lack of gluten, which can sometimes result in a less nutrient-dense product.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Hoagie Buns</h2>

    <p>There are several benefits to choosing gluten-free hoagie buns, especially for those with specific dietary needs:</p>
