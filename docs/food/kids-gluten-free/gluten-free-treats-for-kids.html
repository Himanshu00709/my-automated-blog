    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to skin rashes and even neurological problems. For children, avoiding gluten is crucial if they have been diagnosed with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Even if your child doesn’t have a medical condition, opting for gluten-free treats can sometimes be a healthier choice, as many gluten-free products are made with whole, unprocessed ingredients.</p>

        <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich Options:</strong> Many gluten-free treats are made with nutrient-dense ingredients like almond flour, coconut flour, and quinoa, which can provide essential vitamins and minerals.</li>
        <li><strong>Allergy-Friendly:</strong> Gluten-free treats are often free from other common allergens like dairy and nuts, making them a safe option for kids with multiple food allergies.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety:</strong> Going gluten-free doesn’t mean sacrificing taste. There are countless gluten-free recipes and products that are just as delicious as their gluten-containing counterparts.</li>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Treats at Home</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free treats at home can be a fun and rewarding experience. Here are some tips to get you started:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Gluten-free baking requires alternative flours like almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free flour blend. Each flour has its own unique properties, so experiment to find the one that works best for your recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Binders:</strong> Since gluten provides structure in baked goods, you’ll need to use binders like xanthan gum or psyllium husk to achieve the right texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing gluten-free batter can lead to dense, heavy treats. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Moisture:</strong> Gluten-free baked goods can sometimes be dry, so consider adding extra moisture with ingredients like applesauce, yogurt, or mashed bananas.</li>
    </ul>
