    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get baking! Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free pecan sandies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent the cookies from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer on medium speed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Vanilla and Salt</h3>
    <p>Mix in the vanilla extract and salt until well combined. The vanilla adds a lovely aroma, while the salt enhances the overall flavor of the cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Incorporate the Flour</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the gluten-free flour blend to the butter mixture, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cookies tough.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fold in the Pecans</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the chopped pecans using a spatula. You can adjust the amount of pecans based on your preference—some people like a lot of nuts, while others prefer just a hint.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Shape the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or your hands, shape the dough into 1-inch balls and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Flatten each ball slightly with the palm of your hand or the bottom of a glass.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake, as gluten-free cookies can dry out quickly.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Dust</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, dust the cookies with powdered sugar for a classic finishing touch.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pecan Sandies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>While almond flour can be used in gluten-free baking, it has a different texture and moisture content than a 1:1 gluten-free flour blend. For this recipe, it’s best to stick with a gluten-free flour blend to achieve the right consistency.</p>

        <h3>How do I store gluten-free pecan sandies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months. Just make sure to let them come to room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Simply substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter. Just make sure the substitute is softened to room temperature for best results.</p>

        <h3>Why are my cookies crumbly?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cookies can sometimes be more crumbly than traditional cookies due to the lack of gluten. To reduce crumbliness, make sure not to overmix the dough and allow the cookies to cool completely before handling.</p>
    </div>
