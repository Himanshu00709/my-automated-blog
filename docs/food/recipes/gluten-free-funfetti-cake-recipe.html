    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you’ve gathered your ingredients, let’s get baking! Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free funfetti cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease two 8-inch round cake pans with butter or non-stick spray, then line the bottoms with parchment paper. This will ensure your cakes come out easily after baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, tapioca starch, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make sure the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in your batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, use an electric mixer to cream the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes on medium speed. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients, mixing just until combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Sprinkles</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the gluten-free rainbow sprinkles using a spatula. The sprinkles will add a pop of color and fun to your cake, so don’t skimp on them!</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula, then bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Frost and Decorate</h3>
    <p>Once the cakes are completely cool, it’s time to frost and decorate! You can use your favorite gluten-free vanilla buttercream frosting or store-bought frosting. Spread a layer of frosting on top of one cake, then place the second cake on top. Frost the entire cake and add extra sprinkles for a festive touch.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Funfetti Cake</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a different gluten-free flour blend, but make sure it contains a mix of flours and starches for the best texture. Avoid using single-ingredient flours like almond or coconut flour alone, as they won’t provide the same structure.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a dairy-free milk mixed with a teaspoon of vinegar to replace the buttermilk.</p>

        <h3>3. How do I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake (without frosting) for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make cupcakes instead of a cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this recipe works great for cupcakes! Simply divide the batter into a lined muffin tin and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.</p>
