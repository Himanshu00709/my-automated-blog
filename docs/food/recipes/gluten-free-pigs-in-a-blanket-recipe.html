<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you're ready to bake the pigs in a blanket.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Gluten-Free Puff Pastry</h3>
<p>Roll out the gluten-free puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. If the pastry is too sticky, you can place it between two sheets of parchment paper to make rolling easier. Once rolled out, cut the pastry into 12 equal strips.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Wrap the Sausages</h3>
<p>Take each mini sausage and wrap it in a strip of puff pastry. Make sure the pastry is snug around the sausage, but not too tight, as it will expand during baking. Place the wrapped sausages on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Apply the Egg Wash</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, beat the egg and brush it over the tops of the wrapped sausages. This will give your pigs in a blanket a beautiful golden color when baked.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and puffed up. Keep an eye on them to ensure they don't overcook.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once baked, remove the pigs in a blanket from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Serve them warm with mustard or your favorite dipping sauce. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pigs in a Blanket</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Choose Quality Ingredients:</strong> Opt for high-quality gluten-free sausages and puff pastry to ensure the best flavor and texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't Overcrowd the Baking Sheet:</strong> Make sure to leave enough space between each pig in a blanket on the baking sheet to allow for even baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add herbs or spices to the puff pastry for an extra flavor boost. Garlic powder, paprika, or even a sprinkle of cheese can take this recipe to the next level.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make these ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the pigs in a blanket up to the point of baking and then refrigerate them for up to 24 hours. When you're ready to serve, simply bake them as directed.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free pigs in a blanket?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! After wrapping the sausages in pastry, place them on a baking sheet and freeze until solid. Once frozen, transfer them to a freezer-safe bag. When ready to bake, simply place them on a baking sheet and bake from frozen, adding a few extra minutes to the baking time.</p>

    <h3>What can I serve with gluten-free pigs in a blanket?</h3>
    <p>These make a great appetizer or snack on their own, but you can also serve them with a variety of dipping sauces like mustard, ketchup, or even a spicy aioli. They also pair well with a fresh salad or vegetable platter.</p>
