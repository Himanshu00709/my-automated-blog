    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Brussels Sprouts</h3>
    <p>Start by washing the Brussels sprouts thoroughly under cold water. Trim the ends and remove any yellow or damaged outer leaves. If the sprouts are large, you can cut them in half to ensure even cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). This high temperature will help to caramelize the Brussels sprouts, giving them a delicious crispy texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Season the Brussels Sprouts</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, toss the Brussels sprouts with olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper. Make sure each sprout is evenly coated with the seasoning.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Roast the Brussels Sprouts</h3>
    <p>Spread the seasoned Brussels sprouts in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast them in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are tender and golden brown. Be sure to stir them halfway through to ensure even cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Finishing Touches</h3>
    <p>Once the Brussels sprouts are roasted, remove them from the oven and drizzle with fresh lemon juice. If desired, sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the top for an extra layer of flavor.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Brussels Sprouts</h2>
    <p>Brussels sprouts are a nutritional powerhouse. They are high in fiber, which aids in digestion, and packed with vitamins C and K, which support immune function and bone health. Additionally, they contain antioxidants that help reduce inflammation and protect against chronic diseases. By preparing them in a gluten-free manner, you can enjoy these benefits without compromising your dietary needs.</p>
