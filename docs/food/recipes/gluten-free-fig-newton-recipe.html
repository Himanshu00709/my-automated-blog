<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Fig Filling</h3>

<p>Start by making the fig filling, which is the heart of any Fig Newton. In a medium saucepan, combine the dried figs, water, and lemon juice. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the figs are soft and the liquid has reduced. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly. Once cooled, transfer the mixture to a food processor and blend until smooth. Set aside.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Dough</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. The dough should be soft but not sticky. If it's too dry, you can add a tablespoon of water at a time until it reaches the desired consistency.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble the Fig Newtons</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide the dough into two equal portions. On a lightly floured surface (using gluten-free flour), roll out one portion of the dough into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread half of the fig filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Carefully roll the dough into a log, starting from one of the longer sides. Repeat with the second portion of dough and remaining fig filling.</p>

<h3>4. Bake and Cool</h3>

<p>Place the logs on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let the logs cool completely on a wire rack. Once cooled, slice the logs into individual Fig Newtons using a sharp knife. Serve and enjoy!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use fresh figs instead of dried figs?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use fresh figs, but you may need to adjust the amount of water and cooking time. Fresh figs have a higher moisture content, so you might need to simmer the mixture longer to achieve the desired consistency.</p>

    <h3>Can I substitute almond flour with another type of flour?</h3>
    <p>If you have a nut allergy, you can substitute almond flour with another gluten-free flour like coconut flour or oat flour. Keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>How should I store gluten-free Fig Newtons?</h3>
    <p>Store the Fig Newtons in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can keep them in the refrigerator for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Are these Fig Newtons suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>This recipe contains butter and eggs, so it is not vegan. However, you can make it vegan by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) instead of a regular egg.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This gluten-free Fig Newton recipe is a fantastic way to enjoy a classic treat without compromising on taste or health. By using gluten-free flours and natural ingredients, you can create a snack that's not only delicious but also suitable for those with dietary restrictions. Whether you're making these for yourself or sharing them with friends and family, these Fig Newtons are sure to be a hit.
