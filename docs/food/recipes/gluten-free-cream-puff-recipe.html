    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preparing the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). In a medium saucepan, combine the water, butter, and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Once the butter has melted and the mixture is boiling, reduce the heat to low and add the gluten-free flour blend all at once. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mixture forms a ball and pulls away from the sides of the pan. This should take about 1-2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let the dough cool for about 5 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Adding the Eggs</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has cooled slightly, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. The dough will initially look lumpy, but as you continue to beat it, it will become smooth and glossy. This step is crucial for achieving the right texture for your cream puffs, so take your time and ensure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.</p>

    <h3>3. Piping the Dough</h3>
    <p>Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Pipe small mounds of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. If you don’t have a piping bag, you can use a spoon to drop the dough onto the baking sheet. Smooth the tops of the mounds with a wet finger to ensure even baking.</p>

    <h3>4. Baking the Cream Puffs</h3>
    <p>Bake the cream puffs in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and puffed. Do not open the oven door during the first 15 minutes of baking, as this can cause the puffs to collapse. Once baked, remove the puffs from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack.</p>

    <h3>5. Making the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the cream puffs are cooling, prepare the filling. In a large mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract, and continue to whip until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to over-whip the cream, as it can become grainy.</p>

    <h3>6. Assembling the Cream Puffs</h3>
    <p>Once the cream puffs are completely cool, use a sharp knife to cut off the tops. Fill each puff with the whipped cream using a piping bag or a spoon. Replace the tops and dust with additional powdered sugar if desired. Serve immediately or store in the refrigerator until ready to serve.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cream Puffs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking and contains xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t skip the cooling step:</strong> Allowing the dough to cool slightly before adding the eggs ensures that the eggs don’t cook when mixed into the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Pipe evenly:</strong> Consistent sizing of the dough mounds will ensure even baking. If the puffs are too large, they may not cook through, and if they’re too small, they may dry out.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Cream puffs are best enjoyed fresh, but they can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. If you need to store them longer, consider freezing the unfilled puffs and filling them just before serving.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary. A blend that includes rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch tends to work well for cream puffs.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough up to a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. When you’re ready to bake, let the dough come to room temperature before piping and baking.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze cream puffs?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Unfilled cream puffs can be frozen for up to a month. To serve, simply thaw them at room temperature and fill with whipped cream or your preferred filling.</p>

        <h3>What other fillings can I use?</h3>
        <p>While whipped cream is a classic filling, you can also use pastry cream, chocolate ganache, or even ice cream for a different twist.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free cream puffs are a delightful and elegant dessert that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and techniques, you can create light, airy puffs filled with creamy goodness that rival any traditional recipe. Whether you’re new to gluten-free baking or a seasoned pro, this recipe is sure to impress.
