    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by combining the gluten-free all-purpose flour and xanthan gum in a large mixing bowl. Cut the cold butter and cream cheese into small pieces and add them to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter and cream cheese into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the sugar, egg, and vanilla extract, and mix until the dough comes together. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Nut Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the nut filling. In a food processor, pulse the mixed nuts until they are finely chopped but not powdery. Transfer the nuts to a bowl and mix in the honey and ground cinnamon. Set the filling aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has chilled, roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread the nut filling evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Roll and Bake</h3>
    <p>Carefully roll the dough into a log, starting from one of the longer sides. Pinch the edges to seal. Place the log seam-side down on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 25-30 minutes, or until the dough is golden brown. Allow the nut roll to cool before slicing and serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Ingredients:</strong> Keeping the butter and cream cheese cold is crucial for achieving a flaky dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overwork the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a tough dough. Mix just until the ingredients come together.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize the Filling:</strong> Feel free to experiment with different nuts or add dried fruits for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours like almond flour or oat flour, but keep in mind that the texture may vary. Be sure to adjust the xanthan gum accordingly.</p>

        <h3>How do I store the nut roll?</h3>
        <p>Store the nut roll in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or refrigerate for up to a week. You can also freeze it for longer storage.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with vegan butter, the cream cheese with a vegan alternative, and the egg with a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water).</p>
