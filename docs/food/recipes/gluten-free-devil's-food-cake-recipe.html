    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, or line them with parchment paper for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes with an electric mixer on medium speed.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the buttermilk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients, mixing just until combined after each addition.</p>

    <h3>6. Add Hot Water</h3>
    <p>Finally, stir in the hot water. The batter will be thin, but this is normal. The hot water helps to bloom the cocoa powder, enhancing the chocolate flavor.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>8. Cool and Frost</h3>
    <p>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, frost with your favorite gluten-free chocolate frosting.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a different gluten-free flour blend, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor of the cake may vary slightly. A blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch usually works well.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and use a dairy-free milk (such as almond or soy milk) mixed with a teaspoon of vinegar in place of the buttermilk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake (without frosting) for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe into cupcakes?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this recipe can be adapted to make cupcakes. Simply fill cupcake liners about 2/3 full and bake for 18-22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>
    </div>
