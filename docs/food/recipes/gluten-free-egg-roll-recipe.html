<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Filling</h3>
<p>Start by heating a large skillet over medium heat. Add a tablespoon of sesame oil and sauté the minced garlic until fragrant. Next, add the ground chicken or turkey and cook until browned. Stir in the shredded cabbage, carrots, and green onions, and cook until the vegetables are tender. Season the mixture with gluten-free soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Assemble the Egg Rolls</h3>
<p>Lay a gluten-free egg roll wrapper on a clean surface in a diamond shape. Place about 2 tablespoons of the filling in the center of the wrapper. Fold the bottom corner over the filling, then fold in the sides, and roll tightly to seal. Use a bit of water to moisten the edges if needed to help them stick together. Repeat this process until all the filling is used.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Fry the Egg Rolls</h3>
<p>Heat oil in a deep skillet or pot to 350°F (175°C). Carefully place the egg rolls in the hot oil, seam side down, and fry until golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Serve your gluten-free egg rolls hot with your favorite dipping sauce, such as gluten-free sweet chili sauce or tamari. They make a perfect appetizer, snack, or even a light meal when paired with a fresh salad.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Egg Rolls</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Choose the Right Wrappers:</strong> Look for gluten-free egg roll wrappers made from rice flour or tapioca starch. These are widely available in health food stores or online.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overfill:</strong> Overfilling the wrappers can make them difficult to roll and may cause them to burst during frying.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep the Wrappers Moist:</strong> Gluten-free wrappers can dry out quickly, so keep them covered with a damp cloth while assembling.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Fillings:</strong> Feel free to customize the filling with your favorite vegetables, proteins, or even tofu for a vegetarian option.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Egg Rolls</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I bake gluten-free egg rolls instead of frying?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can bake gluten-free egg rolls for a healthier alternative. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C), brush the egg rolls with a little oil, and bake for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden and crispy.</p>

    <h3>2. Where can I find gluten-free egg roll wrappers?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free egg roll wrappers are available in most health food stores, Asian grocery stores, or online retailers. Look for brands that specifically state they are gluten-free.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make these egg rolls ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can assemble the egg rolls and store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before frying. Alternatively, you can freeze them for up to 2 months. Just fry or bake them straight from the freezer, adding a few extra minutes to the cooking time.</p>

    <h3>4. Are gluten-free egg rolls suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>This recipe can easily be made vegan by substituting the ground meat with tofu or tempeh and ensuring the wrappers are vegan-friendly. Check the ingredient list of the wrappers to confirm.</p>
