<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Sub Rolls?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity over the years, not just among those with celiac disease but also among individuals seeking to improve their overall health. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and inflammation in some people. By opting for gluten-free sub rolls, you can enjoy your favorite sandwiches and meals without the discomfort or health risks associated with gluten consumption.</p>

<p>Moreover, gluten-free sub rolls can be just as flavorful and satisfying as their gluten-containing counterparts. With the right combination of gluten-free flours and ingredients, you can achieve a texture and taste that will leave you wondering why you ever thought gluten-free bread was inferior.</p>

<h2>Ingredients for Gluten-Free Sub Rolls</h2>

<p>Before diving into the recipe, let's take a look at the ingredients you'll need. The key to a successful gluten-free sub roll lies in the blend of flours and the addition of xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity and structure that gluten provides in traditional bread.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Activate the Yeast</h3>

<p>Start by activating the yeast. In a small bowl, combine the warm water (around 110째F), honey (or sugar), and active dry yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. This step ensures that your yeast is alive and ready to help your dough rise.</p>

<h3>2. Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, tapioca flour, xanthan gum, and salt. Make sure the ingredients are well combined to ensure an even texture in your rolls.</p>

<h3>3. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>Add the activated yeast mixture, olive oil, egg, and apple cider vinegar to the dry ingredients. Mix everything together using a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment or a wooden spoon. The dough will be sticky, but that's normal for gluten-free bread dough.</p>

<h3>4. Let the Dough Rise</h3>

<p>Once the dough is well mixed, cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. The dough should double in size. If your kitchen is cool, you can place the bowl in a slightly warmed oven (turned off) to help the dough rise.</p>

<h3>5. Shape the Rolls</h3>

<p>After the dough has risen, preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a sub roll shape. Place the rolls on the prepared baking sheet, leaving enough space between them to expand.</p>

<h3>6. Bake the Rolls</h3>

<p>Bake the rolls in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Remove the rolls from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack before slicing and serving.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Sub Rolls</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a Kitchen Scale:</strong> Measuring your ingredients by weight rather than volume can lead to more consistent results, especially with gluten-free flours.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't Skip the Xanthan Gum:</strong> Xanthan gum is crucial for giving gluten-free bread its structure and elasticity. Without it, your rolls may turn out crumbly.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flours:</strong> Feel free to experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as sorghum flour or coconut flour, to find the flavor and texture you prefer.</li>
    <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Gluten-free bread tends to dry out faster than traditional bread. Store your rolls in an airtight container or freeze them for longer shelf life.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make these rolls without almond flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with another gluten-free flour like coconut flour or oat flour. Keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a different sweetener instead of honey?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can use maple syrup, agave nectar, or even granulated sugar as a substitute for honey in this recipe.</p>

    <h3>How do I know if my yeast is still active?</h3>
    <p>If your yeast mixture doesn't become frothy after 10 minutes, it may be expired or the water temperature may have been too hot or too cold. Try using fresh yeast and ensure the water is around 110째F.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these rolls vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can replace the egg with a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) and use a plant-based sweetener like maple syrup instead of honey.</p>
</div>
