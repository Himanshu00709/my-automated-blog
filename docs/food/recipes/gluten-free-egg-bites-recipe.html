<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your egg bites cook evenly and achieve the perfect texture.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Muffin Tin</h3>
<p>Grease a muffin tin with cooking spray or line it with silicone muffin liners. This step is crucial to prevent the egg bites from sticking to the tin.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Whisk the Eggs</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and black pepper until well combined. The milk adds a bit of creaminess to the egg bites, but you can omit it if you prefer a denser texture.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Your Fillings</h3>
<p>If you’re using any fillings like cheese, cooked bacon, or vegetables, now is the time to add them. Stir the fillings into the egg mixture until evenly distributed.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Pour the Mixture into the Muffin Tin</h3>
<p>Carefully pour the egg mixture into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full. This allows room for the egg bites to rise slightly as they bake.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake the Egg Bites</h3>
<p>Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the egg bites are set and slightly golden on top. You can check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center of an egg bite; if it comes out clean, they’re ready.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the egg bites to cool in the muffin tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack. Serve warm, or store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>

<h2>Variations and Tips</h2>

<p>One of the best things about gluten-free egg bites is their versatility. Here are a few variations and tips to help you customize your egg bites:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Vegetarian Option:</strong> Skip the meat and add more vegetables like spinach, mushrooms, or zucchini.</li>
    <li><strong>Dairy-Free Option:</strong> Use a dairy-free milk alternative and omit the cheese, or use a dairy-free cheese substitute.</li>
    <li><strong>Spicy Kick:</strong> Add a pinch of cayenne pepper or diced jalapeños for a bit of heat.</li>
    <li><strong>Herb Infusion:</strong> Mix in fresh herbs like parsley, chives, or dill for added flavor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Egg Bites</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free egg bites?</h3>
    <p>Yes, gluten-free egg bites freeze well. Allow them to cool completely, then place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze until solid. Once frozen, transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container. They can be reheated in the microwave or oven when ready to eat.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these egg bites in an Instant Pot?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! To make gluten-free egg bites in an Instant Pot, you’ll need silicone egg bite molds. Pour the egg mixture into the molds, cover them with foil, and cook on high pressure for 8-10 minutes. Allow the pressure to release naturally before opening the lid.</p>

    <h3>Are gluten-free egg bites keto-friendly?</h3>
    <p>Yes, gluten-free egg bites can be keto-friendly, especially if you use high-fat ingredients like cheese and bacon. Just be mindful of the carb content in any vegetables you add.</p>

    <h3>Can I use egg whites instead of whole eggs?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use egg whites if you prefer a lower-fat option. However, keep in mind that the texture may be slightly different, and you may need to adjust the cooking time.</p>
