    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions to make this delicious gluten-free macaroni salad.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Gluten-Free Macaroni</h3>
    <p>Begin by cooking the gluten-free macaroni according to the package instructions. Be sure to cook it al dente, as overcooked pasta can become mushy when mixed with the dressing. Once cooked, drain the pasta and rinse it under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set it aside to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Dressing</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, salt, and black pepper. Whisk the ingredients together until they are well combined. This creamy and tangy dressing will be the base of your macaroni salad.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Next, add the chopped celery, red bell pepper, red onion, and fresh parsley to the bowl with the dressing. Stir the vegetables into the dressing to ensure they are evenly coated. The combination of these fresh vegetables will add a delightful crunch and burst of flavor to your salad.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine the Pasta and Dressing</h3>
    <p>Once the macaroni has cooled, add it to the bowl with the dressing and vegetables. Gently toss everything together until the pasta is evenly coated with the dressing. Be careful not to overmix, as this can cause the pasta to break apart.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the macaroni salad for at least an hour before serving. This allows the flavors to meld together and the salad to chill, making it even more refreshing. Before serving, give the salad a final stir and sprinkle with a bit of paprika for an extra touch of flavor and color.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you’re looking to make this recipe dairy-free, simply substitute the mayonnaise with a dairy-free alternative. There are many vegan mayonnaise options available that work just as well.</p>
