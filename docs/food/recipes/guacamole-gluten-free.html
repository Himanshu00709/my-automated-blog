<h1>Guacamole: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

<p>Guacamole, a creamy and flavorful dip made primarily from avocados, has become a staple in many households and restaurants worldwide. Its rich texture and versatility make it a favorite for dipping, spreading, or even as a topping. For those following a gluten-free diet, guacamole is a safe and delicious option. In this article, we will explore the gluten-free nature of guacamole, its health benefits, and how to make the perfect guacamole at home.</p>

<h2>What Makes Guacamole Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Guacamole is naturally gluten-free because its primary ingredients—avocados, lime juice, onions, tomatoes, and cilantro—do not contain gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it is commonly present in many processed foods. However, guacamole is typically made from fresh, whole ingredients, making it a safe choice for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

<p>It's important to note that while guacamole itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur if it is prepared or served with gluten-containing foods. For example, if guacamole is served with wheat-based tortilla chips, it may no longer be gluten-free. Always ensure that the accompanying foods are also gluten-free to maintain a safe diet.</p>

<h2>Health Benefits of Guacamole</h2>

<p>Guacamole is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients that offer numerous health benefits. Here are some of the key health benefits of guacamole:</p>
