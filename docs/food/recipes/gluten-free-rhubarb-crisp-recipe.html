    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Rhubarb</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Wash and chop the rhubarb into 1-inch pieces. In a large bowl, toss the rhubarb with 1/2 cup of granulated sugar. Let it sit for about 15 minutes to allow the rhubarb to release some of its juices.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, rolled oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter and use your fingers or a pastry cutter to mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Transfer the rhubarb mixture to a greased 9x9 inch baking dish. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the rhubarb. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the rhubarb is bubbling.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the crisp to cool slightly before serving. It pairs wonderfully with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. Enjoy your gluten-free rhubarb crisp warm or at room temperature.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure all ingredients are certified gluten-free, especially the oats and flour blend.</li>
        <li>If you prefer a sweeter crisp, you can increase the amount of sugar in the rhubarb mixture.</li>
        <li>For a nuttier flavor, consider adding chopped nuts like almonds or pecans to the topping.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>Can I use frozen rhubarb?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen rhubarb. Just make sure to thaw and drain it well before using to avoid excess moisture in the crisp.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the butter with a plant-based alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter to make this recipe vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other fruits to the crisp?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add other fruits like strawberries or apples to complement the rhubarb. Just adjust the sugar accordingly based on the sweetness of the added fruits.</p>
