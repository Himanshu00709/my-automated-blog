    <h1>Gluten-Free Rugelach Recipe: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Rugelach, a traditional Jewish pastry, is known for its rich, flaky texture and sweet, fruity filling. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this treat can be a challenge. That's where this gluten-free rugelach recipe comes in! Whether you're new to gluten-free baking or a seasoned pro, this recipe will guide you through creating a delicious, gluten-free version of this classic pastry.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Rugelach?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has come a long way, and with the right ingredients, you can create pastries that are just as delicious as their gluten-containing counterparts. Rugelach is a perfect candidate for gluten-free adaptation because its texture relies more on the fat content (usually cream cheese and butter) than on gluten. By using a blend of gluten-free flours, you can achieve a dough that is tender, flaky, and utterly irresistible.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients You'll Need</h2>
    <p>Before diving into the recipe, let's take a look at the ingredients you'll need. Most of these can be found in your local grocery store, but some may require a trip to a specialty store or an online order.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make your gluten-free rugelach.</p>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, xanthan gum, and salt. Cut the cold butter and cream cheese into small cubes and add them to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter and cream cheese into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Be careful not to overwork the dough, as this can make it tough.</p>

    <h3>2. Form the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough comes together, divide it into four equal portions. Shape each portion into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Chilling the dough is crucial as it allows the fats to firm up, making the dough easier to roll out and resulting in a flakier pastry.</p>

    <h3>3. Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>After the dough has chilled, take one disk out of the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Roll the dough into a circle about 1/8 inch thick. Spread a thin layer of your chosen filling (jam, chocolate, nuts, etc.) over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</p>

    <h3>4. Cut and Roll</h3>
    <p>Using a pizza cutter or a sharp knife, cut the dough into 8 wedges (like a pizza). Starting from the wide end, roll each wedge tightly towards the point. Place the rolled rugelach on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, with the pointy end facing down to prevent unraveling during baking.</p>

    <h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a small bowl, beat the egg and brush it over the rugelach to give them a golden, shiny finish. Sprinkle turbinado sugar on top for a bit of extra crunch. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the rugelach are golden brown. Allow them to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture may vary. A blend of rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch often works well for gluten-free baking.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! The dough can be made a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator. Just make sure to let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes before rolling it out.</p>

        <h3>What fillings work best for rugelach?</h3>
        <p>Traditional fillings include apricot jam, raspberry jam, and chocolate. However, you can get creative with fillings like Nutella, cinnamon sugar, or even savory options like pesto and cheese.</p>

        <h3>How do I store gluten-free rugelach?</h3>
        <p>Store your rugelach in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 2 months. Just thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>
