    <p>Honey cake is a timeless dessert that has been enjoyed for centuries across various cultures. Its rich, moist texture and sweet, aromatic flavor make it a favorite for many. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, traditional honey cake recipes can be off-limits due to the use of wheat flour.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions to bake your gluten-free honey cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper to prevent the cake from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and ginger. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until they are light and frothy. Add the honey, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined. Gradually pour in the brewed coffee or tea, stirring continuously to create a smooth mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake. The batter should be smooth and slightly thick.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The cake should be golden brown and spring back when lightly touched.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can dust the top with powdered sugar or drizzle with additional honey for extra sweetness. Slice and serve!</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Honey Cake</h2>
    <p>Here are some additional tips to ensure your gluten-free honey cake turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Opt for a high-quality gluten-free flour blend that is specifically designed for baking. This will help achieve the right texture and consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense and heavy cake. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Ensure that your baking powder and baking soda are fresh, as old leavening agents can affect the cake’s rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add other spices like nutmeg or cloves for a more complex flavor profile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>While almond flour can be used, it will result in a denser and moister cake. For a lighter texture, it’s best to use a gluten-free flour blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and use a plant-based oil. However, the texture may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use maple syrup instead of honey?</h3>
        <p>Yes, maple syrup can be used as a substitute for honey, but it will alter the flavor profile of the cake. Honey provides a distinct sweetness and aroma that is characteristic of honey cake.</p>
