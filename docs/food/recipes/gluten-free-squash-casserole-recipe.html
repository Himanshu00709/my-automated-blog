<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). While the oven is heating, grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with butter or a non-stick cooking spray.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Cook the Vegetables</h3>
<p>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until it becomes translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Add the sliced yellow squash and zucchini to the skillet, and cook for another 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked vegetables, gluten-free breadcrumbs, shredded cheddar cheese, eggs, and milk. Stir until all the ingredients are well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Assemble the Casserole</h3>
<p>Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish, spreading it out evenly. If desired, sprinkle a little extra cheese on top for added flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake</h3>
<p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the casserole is set. You can test for doneness by inserting a knife into the center; it should come out clean.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Remove the casserole from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. This dish pairs wonderfully with a fresh salad or a side of roasted vegetables.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make this casserole ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the casserole up to a day in advance. Simply assemble the dish, cover it with plastic wrap, and store it in the refrigerator. When you're ready to bake, remove the plastic wrap and place the dish in the oven. You may need to add a few extra minutes to the baking time if the casserole is cold from the fridge.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze this casserole?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! This casserole freezes well. After baking, let it cool completely, then wrap it tightly in aluminum foil or plastic wrap. It can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, thaw the casserole in the refrigerator overnight and then bake it in a 350°F oven until heated through.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
    <p>If you don't have gluten-free breadcrumbs on hand, you can use crushed gluten-free crackers, almond flour, or even rolled oats as a substitute. Each option will give the casserole a slightly different texture, but all will work well in this recipe.</p>

    <h3>Is this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>This recipe can easily be made dairy-free by using dairy-free cheese, milk, and butter alternatives. Just make sure to choose products that are labeled as gluten-free if you're strictly avoiding gluten.</p>
