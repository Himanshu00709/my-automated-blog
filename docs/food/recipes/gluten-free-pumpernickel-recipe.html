        </tr>

            <td>Salt</td>
            <td>1 teaspoon</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Warm water</td>
            <td>1 cup</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Active dry yeast</td>
            <td>2 1/4 teaspoons</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Olive oil</td>
            <td>2 tablespoons</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Activate the Yeast</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, combine the warm water and active dry yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the yeast becomes frothy. This step is crucial as it ensures that your bread will rise properly.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free bread flour blend, almond flour, cocoa powder, instant coffee granules, xanthan gum, and salt. Mix these ingredients thoroughly to ensure an even distribution of flavors.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add the molasses, apple cider vinegar, and olive oil to the yeast mixture. Gradually pour this mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring continuously until a dough forms. The dough will be sticky, but that's normal for gluten-free bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Knead the Dough</h3>
    <p>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) and knead it for about 5 minutes. Kneading helps to develop the structure of the bread, even though gluten-free dough doesn't require as much kneading as traditional dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Let the Dough Rise</h3>
    <p>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. The dough should double in size during this time.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Bread</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer the risen dough to a greased loaf pan and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Let the bread cool completely before slicing.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this bread without yeast?</h3>
        <p>While yeast is essential for the traditional texture and rise of pumpernickel bread, you can try using baking powder or baking soda as a leavening agent. However, the result will be denser and less like traditional pumpernickel.</p>
