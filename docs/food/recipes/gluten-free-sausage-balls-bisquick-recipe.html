                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Quantity</th>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your sausage balls will bake evenly and achieve that perfect golden-brown color.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Combine the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free Bisquick mix, ground pork sausage, shredded cheddar cheese, and milk. If you're using garlic powder or onion powder, add them at this stage. Mix everything together until well combined. The mixture should be slightly sticky but hold together when rolled into balls.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Sausage Balls</h3>
    <p>Using your hands or a small cookie scoop, shape the mixture into 1-inch balls. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat, leaving a little space between each ball to allow for even baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Bake the sausage balls in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. You can check for doneness by cutting one open to ensure there's no pink in the center.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once baked, let the sausage balls cool for a few minutes before serving. They are best enjoyed warm, but they can also be stored and reheated for later.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Sausage Balls</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh sausage and cheese will yield the best flavor and texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can make the dough tough. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add other seasonings like smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, or even a dash of hot sauce for a spicy kick.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> You can prepare the sausage balls ahead of time and refrigerate them until you're ready to bake.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Sausage Balls</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I Freeze Gluten-Free Sausage Balls?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze gluten-free sausage balls! After baking, let them cool completely, then place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze. Once frozen, transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container. They can be reheated in the oven or microwave when you're ready to enjoy them.</p>

        <h3>Can I Use a Different Type of Cheese?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While cheddar cheese is the classic choice, you can experiment with other cheeses like pepper jack, mozzarella, or even a blend of cheeses for a unique flavor profile.</p>
