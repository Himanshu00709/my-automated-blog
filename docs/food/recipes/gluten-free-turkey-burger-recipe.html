    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Turkey Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground turkey, gluten-free breadcrumbs, egg, minced garlic, chopped parsley, salt, and black pepper. Use your hands to mix the ingredients thoroughly until well combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the burgers dense.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Form the Patties</h3>
    <p>Divide the mixture into four equal portions. Shape each portion into a patty, about 1/2 inch thick. Make sure the patties are evenly sized so they cook uniformly.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Patties</h3>
    <p>Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the turkey patties. Cook for about 5-6 minutes on each side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Avoid pressing down on the patties while cooking, as this can cause them to lose moisture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Toast the Buns</h3>
    <p>While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the gluten-free burger buns in a toaster or on a skillet. This adds a nice crunch and prevents the buns from becoming soggy.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Assemble the Burgers</h3>
    <p>Place the cooked turkey patties on the toasted buns. Add your favorite toppings, such as lettuce, tomato, avocado, or a gluten-free sauce. Serve immediately and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Turkey Burgers</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I make these burgers ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the turkey patties in advance and store them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before cooking. Alternatively, you can freeze the uncooked patties for up to 3 months. Just make sure to thaw them in the refrigerator before cooking.</p>

        <h3>2. What can I use instead of gluten-free breadcrumbs?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have gluten-free breadcrumbs, you can use almond flour, crushed gluten-free crackers, or even rolled oats as a substitute. These alternatives will help bind the mixture while keeping it gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>3. Are turkey burgers healthier than beef burgers?</h3>
        <p>Turkey burgers are generally leaner and lower in saturated fat compared to beef burgers, making them a healthier option for those watching their cholesterol or calorie intake. However, the nutritional value can vary depending on the ingredients and toppings used.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I grill these burgers instead of cooking them on the stovetop?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Grilling adds a smoky flavor to the burgers. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat and cook the patties for about 5-6 minutes on each side, or until they reach an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).</p>
