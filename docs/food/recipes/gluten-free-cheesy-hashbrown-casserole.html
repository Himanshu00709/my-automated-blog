    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Hashbrown Casserole?</h2>

Plus, this recipe is versatile, allowing you to customize it with your favorite ingredients.</p>

    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your casserole bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown crust.</p>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the frozen hashbrowns, gluten-free cream of mushroom soup, sour cream, melted butter, chopped onion, salt, and pepper. Mix everything thoroughly until the hashbrowns are evenly coated. Stir in 1 1/2 cups of the shredded cheddar cheese, reserving the remaining 1/2 cup for the topping.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Casserole</h3>
    <p>Transfer the mixture to a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread it out evenly, then sprinkle the remaining cheese on top. If you’re using gluten-free breadcrumbs, sprinkle them over the cheese for an extra layer of crunch.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the casserole in the preheated oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly. Let it cool for 5-10 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Casserole</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Cheese:</strong> Opt for freshly shredded cheese rather than pre-shredded varieties, as they tend to melt better and have a richer flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize Your Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to add cooked bacon, diced ham, or sautéed mushrooms for extra flavor and texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Make It Ahead:</strong> This casserole can be assembled the night before and stored in the refrigerator. Simply bake it the next day for a stress-free meal.</li>
    </ul>
