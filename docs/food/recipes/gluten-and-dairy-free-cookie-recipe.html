    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's walk through the step-by-step process of making these delicious gluten and dairy-free cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly and achieve the perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir these dry ingredients together until they are well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the melted coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Whisk these ingredients together until they form a smooth, cohesive mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir the mixture until a thick dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can affect the texture of the cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Chocolate Chips</h3>
    <p>Fold in the dark chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the dough. This step is crucial for achieving that perfect chocolatey bite in every cookie.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Shape the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or your hands, scoop out portions of the dough and shape them into small balls. Place these balls onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving enough space between each cookie to allow for spreading.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Keep an eye on them, as baking times may vary depending on your oven.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten and dairy-free cookies with a glass of almond milk or your favorite dairy-free beverage!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours like oat flour or coconut flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor of the cookies may vary depending on the flour you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different sweetener?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer, you can replace maple syrup with honey, agave nectar, or even a sugar-free sweetener like stevia. Just be mindful of the sweetness level and adjust accordingly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 3 months. Simply thaw them at room temperature before enjoying.</p>

        <h3>Are these cookies suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Yes, these cookies are vegan-friendly as long as you use dairy-free chocolate chips. They contain no animal products, making them a great option for those following a vegan diet.</p>
