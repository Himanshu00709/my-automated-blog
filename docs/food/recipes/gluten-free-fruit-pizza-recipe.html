    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, softened butter, granulated sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Mix until a dough forms. Press the dough evenly into a greased pizza pan or baking sheet, shaping it into a round or rectangular crust. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the crust to cool completely before adding the toppings.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Cream Cheese Topping</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and powdered sugar together until smooth and creamy. Spread this mixture evenly over the cooled crust, leaving a small border around the edges.</p>

    <h3>3. Add the Fresh Fruits</h3>
    <p>Wash and slice your chosen fruits into thin, even pieces. Arrange the fruits on top of the cream cheese layer in a decorative pattern. You can create concentric circles, a rainbow design, or simply scatter the fruits for a more rustic look. Be creative and use a variety of colors to make your fruit pizza visually appealing.</p>

    <h3>4. Chill and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the fruit pizza is assembled, refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the cream cheese to set. Slice and serve chilled. Enjoy this refreshing and healthy dessert with family and friends!</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Fruit Pizza</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend that mimics the texture of regular flour. Almond flour or oat flour can also be used for a nuttier flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Fruits:</strong> Fresh fruits not only taste better but also provide a vibrant appearance. Avoid using canned fruits as they may be too soft and sugary.</li>
        <li><strong>Customize the Toppings:</strong> Feel free to experiment with different fruits, nuts, or even a drizzle of honey or chocolate for added flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep It Cold:</strong> Fruit pizza is best served cold, so store it in the refrigerator until ready to serve.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Fruit Pizza</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the cream cheese with a dairy-free alternative like coconut cream or vegan cream cheese. Similarly, replace the butter with a plant-based option.</p>

        <h3>How long does gluten-free fruit pizza last?</h3>
        <p>When stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator, gluten-free fruit pizza can last for up to 2 days. However, it's best enjoyed fresh to maintain the texture of the fruits.</p>

        <h3>Can I use frozen fruits?</h3>
        <p>While fresh fruits are recommended, you can use thawed frozen fruits in a pinch. Just make sure to drain any excess liquid to prevent the crust from becoming soggy.</p>

        <p>With a few modifications, such as using a flax egg instead of a regular egg and opting for dairy-free cream cheese and butter, this recipe can be made vegan-friendly.</p>
