<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Activate the Yeast</h3>

<p>In a small bowl, combine the warm water (around 110°F) with the sugar and yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy. This indicates that the yeast is activated and ready to use.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, xanthan gum, and salt. Xanthan gum is essential in gluten-free baking as it helps to bind the ingredients together, giving the rolls a more elastic texture similar to gluten-containing dough.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>Add the activated yeast mixture, melted butter, warm milk, and eggs to the dry ingredients. Mix everything together until a soft dough forms. You can use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment or mix by hand. The dough should be slightly sticky but manageable.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Let the Dough Rise</h3>

<p>Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. The dough should double in size. If your kitchen is cool, you can place the bowl in a slightly warmed oven (turned off) to help the dough rise.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Shape the Rolls</h3>

<p>Once the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour). Divide the dough into 12 equal portions and shape each portion into a ball. Place the balls onto a greased baking sheet, leaving some space between each roll to allow for expansion.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Second Rise</h3>

<p>Cover the shaped rolls with a kitchen towel and let them rise for another 30 minutes. During this time, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</p>

<h3>Step 7: Bake the Rolls</h3>

<p>Once the rolls have risen, bake them in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. To check for doneness, you can insert a toothpick into the center of a roll; it should come out clean.</p>

<h3>Step 8: Brush with Butter</h3>

<p>As soon as the rolls come out of the oven, brush the tops with melted butter. This will give them that signature Texas Roadhouse roll shine and add an extra layer of flavor.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. A blend of gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch, often works well for baking.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these rolls dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the milk with a non-dairy alternative like almond milk or oat milk, and use a dairy-free butter substitute for both the dough and the butter brush on top.</p>

    <h3>How should I store the rolls?</h3>
    <p>Store the rolls in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the rolls in a freezer-safe bag for up to 3 months. Reheat them in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these rolls ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough ahead of time and let it rise in the refrigerator overnight. When you're ready to bake, let the dough come to room temperature, shape the rolls, and proceed with the second rise and baking.</p>
