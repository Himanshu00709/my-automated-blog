    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, softened butter, granulated sugar, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix until the dough comes together. Press the dough evenly into a tart pan, making sure to cover the bottom and sides. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Allow it to cool completely before adding the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Custard Filling</h3>
    <p>In a medium saucepan, whisk together the egg yolks, heavy cream, cornstarch, and milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and comes to a gentle boil. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly. Once the custard has cooled, pour it into the prepared crust and spread it evenly.</p>

    <h3>3. Arrange the Fresh Fruits</h3>
    <p>Wash and slice your chosen fruits into thin, even pieces. Arrange them in a decorative pattern on top of the custard filling. You can get creative here—use a mix of colors and shapes to make your tart visually appealing. Once the fruits are arranged, refrigerate the tart for at least 2 hours to allow it to set.</p>

    <h3>4. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the tart has set, remove it from the refrigerator and slice it into portions. Serve chilled and enjoy the burst of flavors from the fresh fruits and creamy custard. This gluten-free fruit tart is perfect for any occasion, from casual gatherings to formal events.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a tart pan with a removable bottom:</strong> This makes it easier to remove the tart without damaging the crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the crust before baking:</strong> This helps prevent shrinkage and ensures a crisp texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose ripe, seasonal fruits:</strong> They will add natural sweetness and vibrant colors to your tart.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the custard:</strong> Overmixing can cause the custard to become grainy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour for the crust?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or a gluten-free all-purpose blend. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>How long does the tart last in the refrigerator?</h3>
        <p>The tart can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Make sure to cover it with plastic wrap or place it in an airtight container to keep it fresh.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the tart ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the crust and custard filling a day in advance. Assemble the tart with fresh fruits just before serving to maintain their freshness and texture.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>This recipe contains dairy and eggs, so it’s not vegan. However, you can experiment with plant-based substitutes like coconut cream and flax eggs to create a vegan version.</p>
