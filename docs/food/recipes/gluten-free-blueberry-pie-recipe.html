    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Pie Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by making the pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, sugar, and salt. Add the cold, diced butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Divide the dough into two equal portions, shape them into discs, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Blueberry Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the filling. In a large bowl, combine the fresh blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Gently toss until the blueberries are evenly coated. Set aside to allow the flavors to meld.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out one disc of the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Carefully transfer the dough to the dish and press it into the edges. Pour the blueberry filling into the crust. Roll out the second disc of dough and place it over the filling. Trim and crimp the edges to seal the pie. Cut a few small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake the Pie</h3>
    <p>Place the pie on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. If the edges of the crust begin to brown too quickly, cover them with aluminum foil. Once baked, remove the pie from the oven and let it cool completely before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Blueberry Pie</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Blueberries:</strong> Fresh blueberries provide the best flavor and texture. If using frozen blueberries, thaw and drain them before using.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Chilling the dough ensures a flaky crust. Don’t skip this step!</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a less sweet pie, reduce the sugar in the filling to 1/3 cup.</li>
        <li><strong>Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend for the best results. Some blends may require additional xanthan gum for elasticity.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries. However, make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in the filling.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover pie?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover pie in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can also freeze the pie for up to 2 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this pie vegan?</h3>
