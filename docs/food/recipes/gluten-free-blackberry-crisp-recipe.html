<h1>Gluten-Free Blackberry Crisp: A Delicious and Healthy Dessert</h1>

<p>When it comes to desserts, few things are as comforting as a warm, fruity crisp. The combination of sweet, juicy fruit and a crunchy, buttery topping is simply irresistible. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding the perfect dessert can sometimes be a challenge. But fear not! This gluten-free blackberry crisp recipe is here to save the day. Not only is it delicious, but it’s also easy to make and packed with wholesome ingredients. Whether you’re gluten-intolerant or just looking for a healthier dessert option, this blackberry crisp is sure to become a favorite.</p>

<h2>Why Choose a Gluten-Free Blackberry Crisp?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity in recent years, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals looking to improve their overall health. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and inflammation in some people. By opting for gluten-free desserts like this blackberry crisp, you can enjoy a delicious treat without the worry of adverse reactions.</p>

<p>Blackberries, the star of this recipe, are not only delicious but also incredibly nutritious. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, making them a great addition to any diet. When paired with a gluten-free crisp topping, you get a dessert that’s both satisfying and good for you.</p>

<h2>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2>

<p>Before we dive into the recipe, let’s take a look at the ingredients you’ll need to make this gluten-free blackberry crisp. The recipe is divided into two parts: the fruit filling and the crisp topping.</p>

<h3>For the Blackberry Filling:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>4 cups fresh blackberries (or frozen, if fresh are not available)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch (or arrowroot powder for a thicker filling)</li>
</ul>

<h3>For the Gluten-Free Crisp Topping:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup gluten-free rolled oats</li>
    <li>1/2 cup almond flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup coconut sugar (or brown sugar)</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 cup cold unsalted butter (or coconut oil for a dairy-free option)</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions for making this gluten-free blackberry crisp.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure that your crisp bakes evenly and gets that perfect golden-brown topping.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Blackberry Filling</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the blackberries, granulated sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and cornstarch. Gently toss the ingredients together until the blackberries are evenly coated. Transfer the mixture to a greased 8x8-inch baking dish, spreading it out evenly.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Make the Crisp Topping</h3>
<p>In another bowl, mix together the gluten-free rolled oats, almond flour, coconut sugar, salt, and ground cinnamon. Add the cold butter (or coconut oil) and use your fingers or a pastry cutter to work the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Assemble and Bake</h3>
<p>Sprinkle the crisp topping evenly over the blackberry filling. Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Remove the crisp from the oven and let it cool for about 10 minutes before serving. This allows the filling to set slightly, making it easier to serve. Enjoy your gluten-free blackberry crisp warm, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream if desired.</p>
