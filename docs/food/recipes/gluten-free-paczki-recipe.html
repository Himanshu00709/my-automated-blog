    <h1>Gluten-Free Paczki Recipe: A Delicious Twist on a Classic Treat</h1>

    <p>Paczki, the beloved Polish doughnuts, are a staple during Fat Tuesday celebrations.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>Start by activating the yeast. In a small bowl, combine the warm milk (around 110°F) with the yeast and a pinch of sugar. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum, sugar, and salt. Add the activated yeast mixture, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Mix until a soft dough forms. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.</p>

    <h3>2. Shape the Paczki</h3>

    <p>Once the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Roll the dough to about 1/2-inch thickness. Using a round cookie cutter or a glass, cut out circles of dough. Place the circles on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, cover with a towel, and let them rise for another 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>3. Fry the Paczki</h3>

    <p>Heat oil in a deep fryer or a heavy-bottomed pot to 350°F. Carefully place a few dough circles into the hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. Fry each side for about 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to remove the paczki from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</p>

    <h3>4. Fill and Dust</h3>

    <p>Once the paczki have cooled slightly, use a piping bag or a small knife to make a hole in the side of each paczek. Fill with your choice of jam, custard, or other filling. Finally, dust the paczki generously with powdered sugar. Serve warm and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Paczki</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Thermometer:</strong> Maintaining the correct oil temperature is crucial for achieving the perfect texture. Too hot, and the paczki will burn on the outside while remaining raw inside. Too cool, and they’ll absorb too much oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overfill:</strong> When filling the paczki, be careful not to overfill them, as this can cause them to burst during frying.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Fillings:</strong> While traditional paczki are filled with jam or custard, feel free to get creative with your fillings. Nutella, lemon curd, or even chocolate ganache can make delicious alternatives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these paczki ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough ahead of time and let it rise in the refrigerator overnight. When you’re ready to fry, let the dough come to room temperature before shaping and frying.</p>

        <h3>Can I bake these instead of frying?</h3>
        <p>While baking is an option, it won’t give you the same texture as frying. If you prefer to bake, preheat your oven to 375°F and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown. However, the result will be more like a gluten-free doughnut than a traditional paczek.</p>

        <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour to use?</h3>
        <p>A gluten-free all-purpose flour blend that includes xanthan gum works best for this recipe. Brands like Bob’s Red Mill or King Arthur Flour are excellent choices.</p>
