    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by crushing 24 gluten-free Oreo cookies into fine crumbs. You can use a food processor or place the cookies in a zip-top bag and crush them with a rolling pin. Once the cookies are crushed, mix them with the melted butter until the mixture resembles wet sand. Press this mixture firmly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie dish. Place the crust in the refrigerator to set while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and granulated sugar together until smooth and creamy. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream, vanilla extract, and powdered sugar until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until well combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can deflate the whipped cream and result in a less fluffy filling.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Pie</h3>
    <p>Remove the crust from the refrigerator and pour the filling into it, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Crush the remaining 6 gluten-free Oreo cookies and sprinkle them over the top of the pie for added texture and flavor. You can also leave some larger chunks for a more rustic look. Place the pie back in the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours, or until the filling is set.</p>

    <h3>4. Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the pie has set, it's ready to serve! Slice it into wedges and enjoy the creamy, chocolatey goodness. For an extra touch, you can drizzle some chocolate syrup or add a dollop of whipped cream on top of each slice.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular Oreos if I don't need a gluten-free option?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can absolutely use regular Oreos if you don't need to follow a gluten-free diet. The recipe will work just as well with regular Oreos, and the taste will be equally delicious.</p>

        <h3>How long does this pie last in the refrigerator?</h3>
        <p>This Gluten-Free Oreo Pie can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Make sure to cover it with plastic wrap or place it in an airtight container to keep it fresh.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze this pie?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze this pie for up to 2 months. To freeze, wrap the pie tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. When you're ready to enjoy it, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of cookie for the crust?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer a different type of cookie, feel free to experiment. Just make sure the cookies you choose are gluten-free if you need to adhere to a gluten-free diet.</p>
