    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make your gluten-free stromboli.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and salt. In a separate bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Let the Dough Rise</h3>
    <p>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. The dough should double in size.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>Once the dough has risen, roll it out on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle shape, about 1/4 inch thick.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Fillings</h3>
    <p>Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce, followed by the pepperoni slices. Sprinkle Italian seasoning over the top.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Roll and Seal</h3>
    <p>Starting from one of the longer sides, carefully roll the dough into a log, tucking in the edges as you go. Seal the seam by pinching the dough together.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the stromboli on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the top with a little olive oil and sprinkle with additional Italian seasoning if desired. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the stromboli is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the stromboli to cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve with additional marinara sauce for dipping, and enjoy!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! While mozzarella is the traditional choice, you can experiment with other cheeses like provolone, cheddar, or even a dairy-free alternative if you're lactose intolerant.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make a vegan version of this stromboli by using dairy-free cheese and plant-based pepperoni or other vegan fillings like sautéed vegetables or tofu.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftovers?</h3>
        <p>Leftover stromboli can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply place it in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10 minutes, or until warmed through.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the stromboli?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the stromboli before baking. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, then freeze for up to 2 months. When ready to bake, thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and then bake as directed.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free stromboli is a fantastic way to enjoy a classic comfort food without the gluten. With a few simple substitutions and a little bit of patience, you can create a dish that is just as delicious and satisfying as the original. Whether you're cooking for yourself, your family, or guests, this recipe is sure to be a hit. So why not give it a try and see for yourself how easy and tasty gluten-free stromboli can be?</p>
