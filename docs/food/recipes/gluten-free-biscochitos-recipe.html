    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, almond flour, tapioca starch, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg, anise extract, and brandy (or rum), and mix until well combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Chill the Dough</h3>

    <p>Once the dough comes together, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Chilling the dough will make it easier to handle and will help the cookies hold their shape during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Preheat and Prepare</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a small bowl, mix together the cinnamon sugar for coating the cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Roll and Cut the Cookies</h3>

    <p>On a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour), roll out the dough to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use a cookie cutter to cut out shapes, traditionally fleur-de-lis or circles. Dip each cookie into the cinnamon sugar mixture, coating both sides, and place them on the prepared baking sheet.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake and Cool</h3>

    <p>Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake, as gluten-free cookies can dry out quickly. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Biscochitos</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of flours and starches for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't skip the chilling step:</strong> Chilling the dough is crucial for preventing the cookies from spreading too much during baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> While anise is traditional, you can try other extracts like vanilla or almond for a different twist.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can dry out faster than traditional ones, so store them in an airtight container to keep them fresh.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of alcohol?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the brandy or rum with another type of alcohol, such as whiskey or even a non-alcoholic option like apple juice. However, the alcohol helps to enhance the flavor and texture of the cookies, so keep that in mind when making substitutions.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>To make this recipe vegan, you can replace the butter with a plant-based alternative and use a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of a regular egg. Keep in mind that the texture may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>How long do these cookies last?</h3>
        <p>When stored in an airtight container, these gluten-free biscochitos will stay fresh for up to a week. You can also freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of sugar for coating?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any type of sugar for coating the cookies. Some people prefer to use powdered sugar or even a mix of cinnamon and coconut sugar for a different flavor profile.</p>
    </div>
