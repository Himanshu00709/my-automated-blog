<h1>Gluten-Free Ezekiel Bread Recipe: A Nutritious and Delicious Alternative</h1>

<p>Ezekiel bread has long been celebrated for its nutritional benefits, being made from a combination of sprouted grains and legumes. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, traditional Ezekiel bread is off the table.

In this article, we’ll explore a detailed recipe for gluten-free Ezekiel bread, its health benefits, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

<h2>What is Ezekiel Bread?</h2>

<p>Ezekiel bread is inspired by the biblical verse Ezekiel 4:9, which mentions a bread made from wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt.

Sprouting grains and legumes not only improves digestibility but also increases the bioavailability of nutrients like iron, zinc, and magnesium. Additionally, gluten-free Ezekiel bread is rich in fiber, protein, and essential amino acids, making it a powerhouse of nutrition.</p>
