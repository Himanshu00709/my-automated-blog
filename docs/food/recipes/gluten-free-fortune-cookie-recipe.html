    <h1>Gluten-Free Fortune Cookie Recipe: A Delightful Twist on a Classic Treat</h1>
    <p>Fortune cookies are a beloved treat, often associated with Chinese cuisine and enjoyed for their sweet, crispy texture and the fun surprise of a hidden message inside. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional fortune cookies are off the menu due to their wheat-based ingredients. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can create gluten-free fortune cookies that are just as delicious and satisfying.

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Fortune Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular as more people discover they have gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and other health problems for those with gluten-related disorders. By using gluten-free flours and ingredients, you can enjoy your favorite treats without the discomfort. Fortune cookies, typically made with wheat flour, can easily be adapted to be gluten-free, allowing everyone to enjoy this fun and festive dessert.</p>

    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent the cookies from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, sugar, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until they are frothy. Add the vanilla extract and water to the egg whites, then gradually mix in the dry ingredients. Stir until the batter is smooth and free of lumps.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a tablespoon, drop small amounts of batter onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 3 inches apart. Use the back of the spoon to spread the batter into thin, even circles. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Fortunes</h3>
    <p>While the cookies are still warm, carefully remove them from the baking sheet and place a small strip of paper with a fortune written on it in the center of each cookie. Fold the cookie in half, then bend it over the edge of a cup or bowl to create the classic fortune cookie shape. Hold the shape for a few seconds until it sets.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool completely on a wire rack before serving. Store any leftovers in an airtight container to maintain their crispiness.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Fortune Cookies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a reliable gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Work quickly:</strong> Fortune cookies need to be shaped while they are still warm, so have your fortunes ready and work efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Add a pinch of cinnamon or almond extract to the batter for a unique twist on the classic flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this recipe is naturally dairy-free, as it does not contain any dairy products. Just ensure that your gluten-free flour blend is also dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How long do gluten-free fortune cookies last?</h3>
        <p>When stored in an airtight container, gluten-free fortune cookies can last up to a week. However, they are best enjoyed within the first few days for optimal crispiness.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze gluten-free fortune cookies?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cookies for up to a month. Place them in a single layer in an airtight container, separating layers with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of egg whites?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer an egg-free version, you can try using aquafaba (the liquid from a can of chickpeas) as a substitute. Whip it until frothy and use it in place of the egg whites.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Gluten-free fortune cookies are a delightful and inclusive treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions. With this easy-to-follow recipe, you can create crispy, sweet fortune cookies that are perfect for parties, special occasions, or just a fun baking project.
