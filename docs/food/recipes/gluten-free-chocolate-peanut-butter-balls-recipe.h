    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that we have all the ingredients ready, let's move on to the step-by-step instructions to make these gluten-free chocolate peanut butter balls.</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Peanut Butter Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter, honey, and vanilla extract. Stir until the mixture is smooth and well combined. This will serve as the base for your peanut butter balls.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Add the Gluten-Free Oats</h3>
    <p>Next, add the gluten-free oats to the peanut butter mixture. Stir until the oats are fully incorporated. The oats will give the balls a nice texture and help hold them together.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Form the Balls</h3>
    <p>Using your hands, scoop out small portions of the mixture and roll them into balls. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Once all the balls are formed, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to allow the balls to firm up.</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Melt the Chocolate</h3>
    <p>While the peanut butter balls are chilling, melt the dark chocolate chips and coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Coat the Balls in Chocolate</h3>
    <p>Remove the peanut butter balls from the refrigerator. Using a fork or a dipping tool, dip each ball into the melted chocolate, ensuring it's fully coated. Place the coated balls back on the parchment paper and return the baking sheet to the refrigerator for another 30 minutes to allow the chocolate to set.</p>
    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the chocolate has set, your gluten-free chocolate peanut butter balls are ready to be enjoyed! Serve them as a dessert or a snack, and store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</p>
