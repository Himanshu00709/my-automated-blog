<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Peanut Butter Mixture</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter, gluten-free oats, honey, and vanilla extract. Stir until all the ingredients are well mixed. The mixture should be thick and sticky, making it easy to form into balls.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Form the Balls</h3>

<p>Using your hands, scoop out small portions of the mixture and roll them into balls about 1 inch in diameter. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Once all the mixture has been rolled into balls, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to allow the balls to firm up.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Melt the Chocolate</h3>

<p>While the peanut butter balls are chilling, melt the dark chocolate chips and coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Coat the Balls in Chocolate</h3>

<p>Remove the peanut butter balls from the refrigerator. Using a fork or a toothpick, dip each ball into the melted chocolate, ensuring it's fully coated. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off before placing the ball back onto the parchment paper. Repeat this process until all the balls are coated.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Chill and Serve</h3>

<p>Once all the balls are coated in chocolate, return the baking sheet to the refrigerator for another 30 minutes to allow the chocolate to set. After the chocolate has hardened, your gluten-free chocolate peanut butter balls are ready to serve! Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different nut butter?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute peanut butter with almond butter, cashew butter, or any other nut butter of your choice. Just make sure it's smooth and not too runny for the best results.</p>

    <h3>Are these balls suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>To make this recipe vegan, simply replace the honey with maple syrup or agave nectar. Ensure that the chocolate chips you use are also vegan-friendly.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze these chocolate peanut butter balls?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! These balls freeze well. Place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze until solid. Once frozen, transfer them to a freezer-safe container or bag. They can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free oats?</h3>
    <p>If you don't have gluten-free oats, you can use quinoa flakes or almond flour as a substitute. Both options will provide a similar texture and help bind the mixture together.</p>
