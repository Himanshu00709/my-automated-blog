<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that we have all the ingredients ready, let's move on to the step-by-step instructions to make these gluten-free chocolate peanut butter balls.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Peanut Butter Mixture</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter, gluten-free oats, honey, and vanilla extract. Mix well until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined. The mixture should be sticky but firm enough to hold its shape when rolled into balls.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Form the Balls</h3>

<p>Using your hands, scoop out small portions of the mixture and roll them into balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Once all the balls are formed, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to allow the balls to firm up.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Melt the Chocolate</h3>

<p>While the peanut butter balls are chilling, melt the dark chocolate chips and coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Coat the Balls</h3>

<p>Remove the peanut butter balls from the refrigerator. Using a fork or a toothpick, dip each ball into the melted chocolate, ensuring it's fully coated. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off before placing the ball back on the parchment paper.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Chill and Serve</h3>

<p>Once all the balls are coated in chocolate, return the baking sheet to the refrigerator for another 30 minutes to allow the chocolate to set. After the chocolate has hardened, your gluten-free chocolate peanut butter balls are ready to serve!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of nut butter?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute peanut butter with almond butter, cashew butter, or any other nut butter of your choice. Just make sure it's smooth and not too runny.</p>

    <h3>Can I use regular oats instead of gluten-free oats?</h3>
    <p>If you don't have a gluten intolerance, you can use regular oats. However, for a truly gluten-free recipe, it's important to use certified gluten-free oats.</p>

    <h3>How long do these balls last?</h3>
    <p>These gluten-free chocolate peanut butter balls can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. They can also be frozen for up to three months.</p>

    <h3>Can I add other ingredients to the mixture?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can add shredded coconut, chopped nuts, or even a sprinkle of sea salt on top of the chocolate coating for extra flavor.</p>

Whether you're making them for a party, a snack, or just because, these balls are sure to be a hit. So, go ahead and give this recipe a tryâ€”you won't be disappointed!</p>
