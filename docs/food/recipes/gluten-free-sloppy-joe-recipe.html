    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Meat</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef (or turkey) over medium heat until it's browned and cooked through. Make sure to break up the meat into small pieces as it cooks. Once the meat is cooked, drain any excess fat and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Sauce</h3>
    <p>Return the cooked meat to the skillet with the vegetables. Add the tomato sauce, tomato paste, gluten-free Worcestershire sauce, gluten-free soy sauce, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, and mustard. Stir everything together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Simmer and Season</h3>
    <p>Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Taste the mixture and season with salt and pepper as needed.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the Sloppy Joe mixture is ready, spoon it onto gluten-free buns or lettuce wraps. Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious, gluten-free Sloppy Joes!</p>
