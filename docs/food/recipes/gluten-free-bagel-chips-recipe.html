    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions to make your gluten-free bagel chips:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This will ensure that your bagel chips bake evenly and become perfectly crispy.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Slice the Bagels</h3>
    <p>Using a sharp knife, slice the gluten-free bagels into thin, even slices. Aim for slices that are about 1/4 inch thick. Thinner slices will result in crispier chips, while slightly thicker slices will give you a chewier texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Seasoning</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. This seasoning mixture will add a burst of flavor to your bagel chips.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Coat the Bagel Slices</h3>
    <p>Place the bagel slices in a large mixing bowl and drizzle the seasoning mixture over them. Toss the slices gently to ensure they are evenly coated with the seasoning.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Arrange on a Baking Sheet</h3>
    <p>Arrange the seasoned bagel slices in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Make sure the slices are not overlapping to ensure even baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the bagel chips are golden brown and crispy. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning, as oven temperatures can vary.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the bagel chips are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely on the baking sheet. This will allow them to crisp up even more. Serve your gluten-free bagel chips with your favorite dip, or enjoy them on their own!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Bagel Chips</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use store-bought gluten-free bagels?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can absolutely use store-bought gluten-free bagels for this recipe. Just make sure to check the ingredient list to ensure they are truly gluten-free and free from any cross-contamination.</p>

        <h3>How long do gluten-free bagel chips last?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free bagel chips can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. If you want to keep them fresh for longer, you can store them in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.</p>

        <h3>Can I customize the seasoning?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Feel free to experiment with different seasonings to suit your taste. Some popular options include adding chili powder for a spicy kick, or using Italian seasoning for a more herbaceous flavor.</p>

        <h3>Are gluten-free bagel chips healthy?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free bagel chips can be a healthier alternative to traditional bagel chips, especially if you use whole-grain gluten-free bagels and minimal oil. However, like any snack, they should be enjoyed in moderation as part of a balanced diet.</p>
