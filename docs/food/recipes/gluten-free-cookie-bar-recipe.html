    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions to make these delicious gluten-free cookie bars.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you’re ready to bake, which is crucial for even baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Baking Pan</h3>
    <p>Line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper or lightly grease it with coconut oil. This will prevent the bars from sticking to the pan and make it easier to remove them once they’re baked.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, gluten-free oats, baking soda, and salt. Stir until all the dry ingredients are well mixed.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Once combined, pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms. If you’re using chocolate chips, fold them into the dough at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Press the Dough into the Pan</h3>
    <p>Transfer the dough to the prepared baking pan and press it down evenly using your hands or a spatula. Make sure the dough is spread out uniformly to ensure even baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Cookie Bars</h3>
    <p>Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The center should be set but still slightly soft to the touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Slice</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the pan from the oven and let the cookie bars cool completely in the pan. Once cooled, lift the bars out of the pan using the parchment paper and slice them into squares or rectangles.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cookie Bars</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that different flours have different absorption rates, so you may need to adjust the quantity of wet ingredients accordingly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these bars vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make these cookie bars vegan, simply ensure that the chocolate chips you use are dairy-free. The rest of the ingredients are already plant-based.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookie bars?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookie bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can keep them in the refrigerator for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other mix-ins?</h3>
        <p>Yes, feel free to customize your cookie bars with other mix-ins like nuts, dried fruits, or seeds. Just make sure they are gluten-free if you’re catering to someone with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>
