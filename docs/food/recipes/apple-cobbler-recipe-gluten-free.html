<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your cobbler bakes evenly and achieves that perfect golden-brown crust.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Apple Filling</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced apples, lemon juice, ½ cup of granulated sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Toss the apples until they are evenly coated with the mixture. Set aside to allow the flavors to meld while you prepare the topping.</p>

<h3>3. Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, remaining ¼ cup of granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the milk, stirring until the dough just comes together.</p>

<h3>4. Assemble the Cobbler</h3>
<p>Transfer the apple mixture to a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler topping over the apples, spreading it out slightly but leaving some gaps for the filling to peek through. This creates a rustic, homemade look.</p>

<h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the apple filling is bubbling. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

<h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
<p>This gluten-free apple cobbler is delicious on its own, but you can elevate it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. For a dairy-free option, consider using coconut milk ice cream or a plant-based whipped topping.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like oat flour or coconut flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Substitute the butter with a plant-based alternative and use a dairy-free milk. The result will still be delicious and suitable for a vegan diet.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You can reheat it in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze the cobbler?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked cobbler for up to 2 months. Make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil to prevent freezer burn.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This gluten-free apple cobbler recipe is a testament to the fact that dietary restrictions don’t have to mean sacrificing flavor or enjoyment.
