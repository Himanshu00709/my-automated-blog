    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these step-by-step instructions to create your gluten-free Oreo cheesecake:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Crush 24 gluten-free Oreo cookies into fine crumbs using a food processor or by placing them in a zip-top bag and crushing them with a rolling pin. Mix the crumbs with the melted butter until well combined. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan, making sure to create an even layer. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool while you prepare the filling.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Make the Cheesecake Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until it's smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sugar, mixing until fully incorporated. Add the sour cream and vanilla extract, and continue to mix until the batter is smooth. Finally, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Be careful not to overmix, as this can introduce too much air into the batter, leading to cracks in the cheesecake.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the cheesecake filling over the cooled crust. Crush 6 additional gluten-free Oreo cookies and sprinkle them over the top of the filling. Place the springform pan in a larger baking dish and fill the dish with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the springform pan. This water bath will help prevent the cheesecake from cracking. Bake for 55-60 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door slightly open for about an hour. Then, remove it from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature before refrigerating for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular Oreo cookies if I don't need a gluten-free version?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular Oreo cookies if you don't need a gluten-free version. The recipe will work just as well with regular Oreos.</p>

        <h3>How do I store the cheesecake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cheesecake in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container, for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cheesecake for up to 2 months. To freeze, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil. Thaw in the refrigerator before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this recipe dairy-free by using dairy-free cream cheese, sour cream, and butter substitutes. There are many dairy-free alternatives available in most grocery stores.</p>

        <h3>Why did my cheesecake crack?</h3>
        <p>Cheesecakes can crack due to overmixing the batter, baking at too high a temperature, or cooling too quickly. Using a water bath and allowing the cheesecake to cool gradually in the oven can help prevent cracking.</p>

    <p>This gluten-free Oreo cheesecake is a decadent dessert that combines the creamy richness of cheesecake with the delightful crunch of gluten-free Oreo cookies. It's perfect for anyone following a gluten-free diet or for those who simply want to try a new twist on a classic dessert.
