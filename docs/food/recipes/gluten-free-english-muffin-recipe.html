    <h1>Gluten-Free English Muffin Recipe: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>English muffins are a breakfast staple, loved for their nooks and crannies that perfectly hold butter, jam, or eggs.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Activate the Yeast</h3>

    <p>In a small bowl, combine the warm water (around 110°F) with the sugar and active dry yeast. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy. This indicates that the yeast is activated and ready to use.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat the egg and mix it with the melted butter. Add the yeast mixture to the egg and butter, then pour this wet mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir until a dough forms. The dough will be sticky, but that’s normal for gluten-free recipes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Muffins</h3>

    <p>Lightly dust your work surface with gluten-free flour. Divide the dough into 6 equal portions and shape each portion into a round, flat disk, about 3/4 inch thick. Sprinkle cornmeal on a baking sheet and place the shaped muffins on it. Cover them with a clean kitchen towel and let them rise for about 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Muffins</h3>

    <p>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. Lightly grease the surface with butter or oil. Cook the muffins for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. You can also use a fork to split them open and check if the inside is fully cooked.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once cooked, let the muffins cool slightly before splitting them open with a fork. Toast them and serve with your favorite toppings, such as butter, jam, or eggs. These gluten-free English muffins are best enjoyed fresh but can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. However, make sure it contains a binding agent like xanthan gum or guar gum to help the dough hold together.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the melted butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. The recipe will still turn out delicious.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store any leftover muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them for up to 2 months. Just toast them before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add flavors to the dough?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize the flavor of your muffins by adding ingredients like cinnamon, raisins, or even cheese to the dough before shaping.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Gluten-free English muffins are a fantastic alternative for those who need to avoid gluten but still want to enjoy a classic breakfast treat. With this easy-to-follow recipe, you can make delicious, homemade gluten-free English muffins that are just as good as the traditional ones.
