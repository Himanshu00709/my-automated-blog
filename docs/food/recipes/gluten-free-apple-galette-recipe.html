<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Gluten-Free Crust</h3>
<p>Start by making the gluten-free crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, xanthan gum (if needed), and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough. Once the dough forms a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Apple Filling</h3>
<p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the apple filling. In a large bowl, toss the thinly sliced apples with lemon juice to prevent browning. Add the granulated sugar, ground cinnamon, and cornstarch, and mix until the apples are evenly coated. Set the filling aside while you roll out the dough.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble the Galette</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). On a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour), roll out the chilled dough into a rough circle, about 12 inches in diameter. Transfer the dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Arrange the apple slices in the center of the dough, leaving a 2-inch border around the edges. Fold the edges of the dough over the apples, pleating as you go to create a rustic look.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Bake the Galette</h3>
<p>Brush the edges of the dough with a little milk or beaten egg for a golden finish. Sprinkle the galette with a little extra sugar if desired. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the apples are tender. Remove from the oven and let the galette cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour for the crust?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as almond flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor of the crust may vary depending on the flour you use. For best results, stick to a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend that includes xanthan gum or add it separately.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this galette ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough and apple filling ahead of time. Store the dough in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, and the apple filling can be prepared a day in advance and stored in the fridge. Assemble and bake the galette when you're ready to serve.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze the galette?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the unbaked galette. Assemble the galette as directed, then wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and freeze. When you're ready to bake, simply place the frozen galette in the oven and add a few extra minutes to the baking time. You can also freeze the baked galette, but it's best enjoyed fresh.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This gluten-free apple galette is a delightful dessert that's perfect for any occasion. With its flaky, buttery crust and sweet, cinnamon-spiced apple filling, it's a treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions. The simplicity of the galette makes it an excellent choice for both novice and experienced bakers alike.
