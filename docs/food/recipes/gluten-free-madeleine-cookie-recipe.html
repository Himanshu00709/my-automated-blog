    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Madeleine Pan</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease your madeleine pan with butter or a non-stick cooking spray. Dust the pan with a little gluten-free flour to ensure the madeleines release easily after baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Beat the Eggs and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and granulated sugar together until the mixture becomes pale and slightly thickened. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer. Add the vanilla extract and lemon zest (if using) and mix until combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the egg mixture, being careful not to overmix. Once the batter is smooth, slowly add the melted butter and mix until fully incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fill the Madeleine Pan</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into the prepared madeleine pan, filling each mold about 3/4 full. Be careful not to overfill, as the madeleines will expand during baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Madeleines</h3>
    <p>Bake the madeleines in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers spring back when lightly touched. Remove from the oven and let them cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Madeleines</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense madeleines. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Batter:</strong> For even better results, chill the batter in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before baking. This helps the madeleines develop their signature hump.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> While classic madeleines are flavored with vanilla and lemon zest, you can get creative by adding orange zest, almond extract, or even a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like rice flour or oat flour, but keep in mind that the texture may vary. A blend of flours usually works best for achieving the right consistency.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these madeleines dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. Just make sure to use a product that has a similar fat content to butter for the best results.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free madeleines?</h3>
        <p>Store the madeleines in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 2 months. Just thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make mini madeleines?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a mini madeleine pan if you prefer smaller cookies. Just reduce the baking time to 8-10 minutes, as they will cook faster.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free madeleines are a delightful treat that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and a little patience, you can create these classic French cookies that are light, buttery, and full of flavor. Whether you’re serving them with tea, coffee, or as a sweet snack, these gluten-free madeleines are sure to become a favorite in your baking repertoire. Happy baking!</p>
