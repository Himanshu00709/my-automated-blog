    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free thumbprint cookies:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent the cookies from sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, and salt. This ensures that the dry ingredients are evenly distributed, which is crucial for achieving the right texture in your cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer. Add the egg yolk and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Shape the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a tablespoon or a small cookie scoop, portion out the dough and roll it into balls. Place the balls on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Use your thumb or the back of a teaspoon to make an indentation in the center of each cookie.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Add the Jam</h3>
    <p>Fill each indentation with a small amount of jam or preserves. You can use any flavor you like, but raspberry, strawberry, and apricot are popular choices.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may still look soft, but they will firm up as the cookies cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, they’re ready to serve!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Thumbprint Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some additional tips to ensure your gluten-free thumbprint cookies turn out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will yield the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t skip the almond flour:</strong> Almond flour adds a nice texture and flavor to the cookies, and it helps to balance out the dryness that can sometimes occur with gluten-free baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough if necessary:</strong> If the dough is too soft to handle, you can chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before shaping the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with different fillings:</strong> While jam is the traditional filling, you can also use chocolate, caramel, or even a dollop of nut butter for a different twist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor of the cookies may vary. A blend of gluten-free flours usually works best for achieving a similar texture to traditional cookies.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or a plant-based butter. Just make sure it’s softened before creaming it with the sugar.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months. Just make sure to thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I use fresh fruit instead of jam?</h3>
        <p>While fresh fruit can be used, it may release more moisture during baking, which can affect the texture of the cookies. If you want to use fresh fruit, consider reducing the moisture by cooking it down into a compote first.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free thumbprint cookies are a delightful treat that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and a little bit of patience, you can create cookies that are just as delicious and satisfying as the traditional version. Whether you’re baking for a special occasion or just want to enjoy a sweet treat, this gluten-free thumbprint cookie recipe is sure to become a favorite in your household. Happy baking!</p>
