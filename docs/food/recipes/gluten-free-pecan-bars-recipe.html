<h1>Gluten-Free Pecan Bars Recipe</h1>

These bars are not only gluten-free but also packed with the rich, nutty flavor of pecans, making them a delightful treat for anyone, whether you're gluten-intolerant or simply looking for a healthier dessert option. In this blog post, we'll walk you through a detailed recipe for making these scrumptious gluten-free pecan bars, along with tips, FAQs, and more.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>Before we dive into the recipe, let's take a look at the ingredients you'll need. The ingredients are divided into two parts: the crust and the filling.</p>

<h3>For the Crust:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 ½ cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<h3>For the Filling:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups pecans, chopped</li>
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>½ cup honey</li>
    <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's move on to the step-by-step instructions for making these gluten-free pecan bars.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, softened butter, granulated sugar, and salt. Mix until the dough comes together. Press the dough evenly into the bottom of a greased 9x9 inch baking pan. Bake the crust for 15 minutes, or until it is lightly golden. Remove from the oven and set aside.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>
<p>In a medium saucepan, combine the butter, honey, brown sugar, heavy cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil. Let it boil for 1 minute, then remove from heat. Stir in the chopped pecans, ensuring they are well-coated with the mixture.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble and Bake</h3>
<p>Pour the pecan filling over the pre-baked crust, spreading it evenly. Return the pan to the oven and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is bubbly and set. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely before cutting into bars.</p>
