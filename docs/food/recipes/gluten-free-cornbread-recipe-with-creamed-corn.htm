<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Follow these simple steps to make your gluten-free cornbread:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish or a cast-iron skillet.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk, melted butter, and honey (or sugar). Mix well.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Creamed Corn:</strong> Gently fold in the creamed corn until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish or skillet. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cornbread to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy warm with butter or your favorite spread.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cornbread</h2>

<p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free cornbread turns out perfectly every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Fresh baking powder and cornmeal will give your cornbread the best texture and flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense cornbread. Mix until just combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a sweeter cornbread, you can increase the amount of honey or sugar to your taste.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to add shredded cheese, jalapeños, or herbs to customize your cornbread.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don’t need the recipe to be gluten-free. However, the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the milk with a dairy-free alternative like almond milk or oat milk, and use a dairy-free butter substitute.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftover cornbread?</h3>
    <p>Store leftover cornbread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I use frozen corn instead of creamed corn?</h3>
