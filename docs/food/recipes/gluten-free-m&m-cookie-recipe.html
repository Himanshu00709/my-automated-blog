    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's walk through the steps to make these delicious gluten-free M&M cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you're ready to bake the cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. This helps to evenly distribute the leavening agents and ensures a consistent texture in your cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugars</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Egg and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the egg and vanilla extract to the butter-sugar mixture and mix until well combined. This adds moisture and flavor to your cookie dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to tough cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in the M&M Candies</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the M&M candies until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough. This ensures that every bite of your cookie is packed with colorful, chocolatey goodness.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your delicious gluten-free M&M cookies!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. Just make sure it's a 1:1 substitute for all-purpose flour to ensure the right texture.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use dairy-free butter?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you're avoiding dairy, you can substitute the unsalted butter with a dairy-free alternative. Just make sure it's suitable for baking.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the dough or baked cookies for longer storage.</p>
    </div>
