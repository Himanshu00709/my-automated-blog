    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make these delicious Gluten-Free M&M Cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you're ready to bake the cookies, which is crucial for even baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. This helps to evenly distribute the leavening agent and salt throughout the flour, ensuring a consistent texture in your cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugars</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened unsalted butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This process incorporates air into the dough, which helps the cookies rise and become tender.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Egg and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined. The egg acts as a binding agent, while the vanilla extract adds a lovely aroma and flavor to the cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Overmixing can lead to tough cookies, so be careful not to overdo it.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in the M&M's</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the M&M's until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough. This ensures that every bite of your cookie is packed with colorful, chocolatey goodness.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers may look slightly underbaked, but they will firm up as the cookies cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your delicious Gluten-Free M&M Cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free M&M Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure that your Gluten-Free M&M Cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Good Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will give you the best texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix the dough until just combined, and then fold in the M&M's gently.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If you have the time, chilling the dough for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much and give them a better texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Parchment Paper:</strong> Lining your baking sheet with parchment paper prevents the cookies from sticking and makes cleanup a breeze.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the cookies to be gluten-free. However, if you or someone you're baking for has a gluten intolerance or celiac disease, it's important to stick with gluten-free flour.</p>

        <h3>Can I use other types of chocolate instead of M&M's?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute M&M's with chocolate chips, chopped chocolate, or any other type of chocolate you prefer. Just make sure to adjust the quantity accordingly.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months. To freeze, place the cooled cookies in a single layer in a freezer-safe container, separating layers with parchment paper.</p>

        <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. When you're ready to bake, let the dough sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes before scooping and baking.</p>
