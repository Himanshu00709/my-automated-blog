<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Flan</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free flan is a straightforward process that requires careful attention to ingredient selection and preparation. Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating a delicious gluten-free flan:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Caramel</h3>
<p>Start by melting sugar in a saucepan over medium heat until it turns into a golden-brown caramel. Pour the caramel into the bottom of your flan mold or ramekins, ensuring it coats the base evenly. Allow the caramel to cool and harden.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix the Custard</h3>
<p>In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, sugar, and vanilla extract until well combined. Be sure to use gluten-free milk and vanilla extract to avoid any gluten contamination. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve to remove any lumps and ensure a smooth texture.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Bake the Flan</h3>
<p>Pour the custard mixture over the hardened caramel in the mold. Place the mold in a larger baking dish and fill the dish with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the flan mold. This water bath method helps the flan cook evenly and prevents cracking. Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 45-50 minutes, or until the custard is set but still slightly jiggly in the center.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Chill and Serve</h3>
<p>Once baked, remove the flan from the oven and let it cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to allow the flavors to meld and the texture to firm up. To serve, run a knife around the edges of the mold and invert the flan onto a serving plate, allowing the caramel to drizzle over the top.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Gluten-Free Flan</h2>

<p>Gluten-free flan offers several benefits, especially for those with dietary restrictions. Here are some reasons why you should consider making gluten-free flan:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Safe for Celiac Disease:</strong> Gluten-free flan is safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, allowing them to enjoy a classic dessert without health risks.</li>

    <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich:</strong> Flan is made with nutrient-rich ingredients like eggs and milk, providing a good source of protein and calcium.</li>
    <li><strong>Easy to Make:</strong> With simple ingredients and straightforward preparation, gluten-free flan is an easy dessert to whip up for any occasion.</li>
</ul>
