    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Start by dicing the bell peppers and onion. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced vegetables and sauté until they are soft and slightly caramelized, about 5-7 minutes. Add the chopped spinach and cook for an additional 2 minutes until wilted. Remove the vegetables from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Eggs</h3>
    <p>In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of olive oil. Crack the eggs into a bowl, whisk them together, and pour them into the skillet. Cook the eggs, stirring occasionally, until they are scrambled and fully cooked. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Warm the Tortillas</h3>
    <p>While the eggs are cooking, warm the gluten-free tortillas in a separate skillet or microwave for about 20-30 seconds. This will make them more pliable and easier to roll.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Burritos</h3>
    <p>Lay out each tortilla on a flat surface. Divide the scrambled eggs, sautéed vegetables, black beans, shredded cheese (if using), and avocado slices evenly among the tortillas. Top each with a spoonful of salsa.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Roll the Burritos</h3>
    <p>To roll the burritos, fold the sides of the tortilla over the filling, then roll from the bottom up, tucking in the sides as you go. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and filling.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Your gluten-free breakfast burritos are now ready to serve! You can enjoy them immediately or wrap them in foil for a quick, on-the-go breakfast. They also store well in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, making them a great option for meal prep.</p>
