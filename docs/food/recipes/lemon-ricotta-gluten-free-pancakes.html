    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the cooking process. Follow these simple steps to create the perfect Lemon Ricotta Gluten-Free Pancakes:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dry Ingredients</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make sure all the dry ingredients are well combined to ensure even distribution in the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>

    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, eggs, milk, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and well incorporated. The ricotta should be fully blended, but a few small lumps are okay—they add to the texture of the pancakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Gently fold the mixture together until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense pancakes. A few lumps in the batter are perfectly fine.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Pancakes</h3>

    <p>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with butter or oil. Using a ladle or measuring cup, pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip the pancakes and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and serve immediately. Top with your favorite toppings, such as fresh berries, a drizzle of maple syrup, or a dollop of whipped cream. Enjoy your delicious Lemon Ricotta Gluten-Free Pancakes!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. Almond flour, coconut flour, or oat flour can also work, but you may need to adjust the liquid content slightly to achieve the right consistency.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these pancakes dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the ricotta cheese with a dairy-free alternative, such as almond or coconut-based ricotta. Similarly, use a dairy-free milk alternative like almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover pancakes?</h3>
        <p>Leftover pancakes can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply warm them in a toaster or microwave until heated through.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze these pancakes?</h3>
        <p>Yes, these pancakes freeze well. Place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze until solid. Then, transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container. They can be reheated directly from the freezer in a toaster or oven.</p>
