    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Seed Mixture</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and sesame seeds. Mix well to ensure an even distribution of seeds. If you’re using whole flaxseeds, consider grinding them slightly to help the mixture bind better.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the water, olive oil, and salt. Pour this mixture over the seeds and stir thoroughly. Allow the mixture to sit for about 15-20 minutes. During this time, the chia and flaxseeds will absorb the water, creating a gel-like consistency that helps bind the crackers together.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Spread the Mixture</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread the seed mixture evenly onto the parchment paper, using a spatula or your hands to press it into a thin, even layer. The thinner the layer, the crispier the crackers will be.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Crackers</h3>
    <p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the edges start to turn golden brown. Keep an eye on the crackers to prevent burning. Once baked, remove the sheet from the oven and let it cool for about 10 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cut and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the seed mixture has cooled slightly, use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut it into cracker-sized pieces. Allow the crackers to cool completely before storing them in an airtight container. They can be stored at room temperature for up to a week.</p>
