    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's get started with the step-by-step instructions to make these gluten-free peanut butter balls.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the peanut butter, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract. Stir until the mixture is smooth and well combined. If you prefer a sweeter taste, you can add a bit more honey or maple syrup to suit your taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Next, add the gluten-free oats and ground flaxseed to the wet mixture. Stir until all the ingredients are evenly distributed. If you're using dark chocolate chips or shredded coconut, you can add them at this stage as well. These optional ingredients will add extra texture and flavor to your peanut butter balls.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Form the Balls</h3>
    <p>Once the mixture is well combined, it's time to form the balls. Scoop out about a tablespoon of the mixture and roll it between your palms to form a ball. Repeat this process until all the mixture is used up. You should be able to make around 15-20 balls, depending on the size.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Chill the Balls</h3>
    <p>Place the formed balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Once all the balls are formed, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to allow the balls to firm up. Chilling the balls will make them easier to handle and give them a nice, firm texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>After the balls have chilled, they're ready to be served! You can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week, or in the freezer for up to a month. These gluten-free peanut butter balls make a great snack for on-the-go, a post-workout treat, or even a healthy dessert option.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Making the Perfect Peanut Butter Balls</h2>

    <p>Here are some additional tips to help you make the perfect gluten-free peanut butter balls:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Natural Peanut Butter:</strong> Natural peanut butter without added sugars or oils works best for this recipe. It provides a rich, nutty flavor and a smooth texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a less sweet snack, you can reduce the amount of honey or maple syrup. Alternatively, if you have a sweet tooth, you can add a bit more.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to get creative with the add-ins. You can try adding chopped nuts, dried fruit, or even a sprinkle of cinnamon for extra flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill Before Serving:</strong> Chilling the balls before serving is crucial. It helps them hold their shape and gives them a satisfying texture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond butter instead of peanut butter?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute almond butter for peanut butter if you prefer. Almond butter will give the balls a slightly different flavor, but they will still be delicious and gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>Are these peanut butter balls keto-friendly?</h3>
        <p>While this recipe is gluten-free, it may not be keto-friendly due to the honey or maple syrup. If you're following a keto diet, you can try using a low-carb sweetener like stevia or erythritol instead.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these peanut butter balls nut-free?</h3>
        <p>If you have a nut allergy, you can try using sunflower seed butter or another nut-free alternative. Just make sure to check the labels to ensure all ingredients are nut-free.</p>

        <h3>How long do these peanut butter balls last?</h3>
        <p>These peanut butter balls can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. If you want to keep them longer, you can freeze them for up to a month.</p>
