<h1>Arroz con Gandules Gluten-Free: A Culinary Delight</h1>

Over time, the dish evolved with the influence of African and Spanish culinary traditions, resulting in the flavorful and aromatic dish we know today.</p>

<p>Traditionally, Arroz con Gandules is made with sofrito, a mixture of onions, garlic, bell peppers, and cilantro, which provides a rich base of flavors. The dish is often cooked with pork or ham, adding a savory depth to the rice and peas. However, for those who prefer a vegetarian or vegan version, the dish can easily be adapted by omitting the meat and using vegetable broth instead.</p>

When combined with pigeon peas, rice forms a complete protein, making Arroz con Gandules a well-rounded meal. Additionally, the dish is gluten-free, making it suitable for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Sofrito:</strong> In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, bell pepper, and cilantro. Sauté until the vegetables are soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the Tomato Sauce:</strong> Stir in the tomato sauce and cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
    <li><strong>Incorporate the Rice and Pigeon Peas:</strong> Add the rice to the pot and stir to coat it with the sofrito mixture. Drain and rinse the pigeon peas, then add them to the pot along with the bay leaf, salt, and black pepper.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the Broth:</strong> Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
    <li><strong>Finish and Serve:</strong> Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork, and if desired, stir in the sliced olives. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
