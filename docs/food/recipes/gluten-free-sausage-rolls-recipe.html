        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Filling</h3>

    <p>Start by preparing the sausage filling. In a large mixing bowl, combine the pork sausage meat, finely chopped onion, minced garlic, chopped parsley, salt, and black pepper. Mix everything together until well combined. You can use your hands to ensure the ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the sausage meat.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Roll Out the Pastry</h3>

    <p>Next, roll out your gluten-free puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. If your pastry comes pre-rolled, you can skip this step. Otherwise, roll it out to a thickness of about 3-4mm. Cut the pastry into two equal rectangles, which will make it easier to assemble the sausage rolls.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Sausage Rolls</h3>

    <p>Divide the sausage mixture into two equal portions. Shape each portion into a long sausage shape and place it along the length of one edge of each pastry rectangle. Brush the opposite edge of the pastry with the beaten egg, then roll the pastry over the sausage meat, sealing the edges by pressing down gently with a fork. Repeat this process for the second rectangle.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cut and Score</h3>

    <p>Once the sausage rolls are assembled, cut them into smaller pieces, about 5-6cm in length. Use a sharp knife to make small diagonal scores on the top of each roll. This will allow the pastry to expand slightly during baking and give the rolls a professional finish.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 200°C (180°C fan). Place the sausage rolls on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, leaving some space between each roll. Brush the tops with the remaining beaten egg to give them a golden, glossy finish. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the sausage meat is cooked through.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once baked, remove the sausage rolls from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving. They’re best enjoyed warm, but they can also be served at room temperature. Pair them with your favorite dipping sauce, such as ketchup or mustard, for an extra burst of flavor.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of meat?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the pork sausage meat with chicken, turkey, or even a plant-based sausage alternative if you prefer. Just make sure the meat or substitute is well-seasoned to ensure the sausage rolls are flavorful.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these sausage rolls ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the sausage rolls up to the point of baking, then cover them and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. When you’re ready to bake, simply remove them from the fridge, brush with egg wash, and bake as directed.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover sausage rolls?</h3>
        <p>Leftover sausage rolls can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, place them in a preheated oven at 180°C for about 10 minutes, or until heated through.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze these sausage rolls?</h3>
        <p>Yes, these sausage rolls freeze well. After assembling, place them on a baking tray and freeze until solid. Once frozen, transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container. When ready to bake, simply place them on a baking tray and bake from frozen, adding an extra 5-10 minutes to the cooking time.</p>
