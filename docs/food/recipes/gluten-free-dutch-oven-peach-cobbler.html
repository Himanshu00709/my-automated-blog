<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat Your Dutch Oven</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your Dutch oven. If you're using a cast iron Dutch oven, place it in your oven and set the temperature to 375°F (190°C). This will ensure that your cobbler bakes evenly.</p>

<h3>2. Prepare the Peach Filling</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced peaches, 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Toss the peaches until they are evenly coated with the sugar and cinnamon. Set the bowl aside to allow the peaches to release their natural juices.</p>

<h3>3. Make the Cobbler Topping</h3>

<p>In another bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, remaining 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract until just combined.</p>

<h3>4. Assemble the Cobbler</h3>

<p>Once your Dutch oven is preheated, carefully remove it from the oven. Spread the peach filling evenly across the bottom of the Dutch oven. Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler topping over the peaches, spreading it out as evenly as possible.</p>

<h3>5. Bake to Perfection</h3>

<p>Place the lid on the Dutch oven and return it to the oven. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the peach filling is bubbling. Remove the lid during the last 10 minutes of baking to allow the topping to crisp up.</p>

<h3>6. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Allow the cobbler to cool slightly before serving. Serve it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra indulgent treat.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use frozen peaches instead of fresh ones?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen peaches if fresh ones are not available. Just make sure to thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in your cobbler.</p>

    <h3>What gluten-free flour blend works best for this recipe?</h3>
    <p>A 1:1 gluten-free flour blend, such as those from brands like Bob's Red Mill or King Arthur, works well in this recipe. These blends are designed to mimic the texture and performance of all-purpose flour.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a dairy-free milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftover cobbler in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

<p>This gluten-free Dutch oven peach cobbler is a delightful dessert that brings together the natural sweetness of peaches with a tender, gluten-free topping.
