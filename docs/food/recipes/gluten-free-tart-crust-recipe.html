<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's move on to the step-by-step instructions for making the perfect gluten-free tart crust. Follow these steps carefully to ensure that your crust turns out flaky, tender, and delicious.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut flour, xanthan gum, and salt. Mix well to ensure that all the ingredients are evenly distributed. The xanthan gum is essential in gluten-free baking as it helps to bind the ingredients together, giving the crust a similar texture to traditional wheat-based crusts.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Add Cold Butter</h3>

<p>Cut the cold unsalted butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. The butter should be evenly distributed throughout the mixture, but there should still be small chunks of butter visible. These chunks will melt during baking, creating a flaky texture in the crust.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add the Egg</h3>

<p>Add the egg to the mixture and gently mix it in with a fork or your hands. The egg will help to bind the dough together, making it easier to roll out and shape. If the dough seems too dry, you can add a tablespoon or two of cold water to bring it together. Be careful not to overwork the dough, as this can make the crust tough.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Chill the Dough</h3>

<p>Once the dough comes together, shape it into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes. Chilling the dough will make it easier to roll out and will help to prevent the crust from shrinking during baking.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Roll Out the Dough</h3>

<p>After the dough has chilled, remove it from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to make it easier to roll out. Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and roll it out to your desired thickness. Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough to a tart pan, pressing it gently into the edges and trimming any excess dough.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Blind Bake the Crust</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). To prevent the crust from puffing up during baking, you'll need to blind bake it. Line the crust with parchment paper and fill it with pie weights or dried beans. Bake the crust for 10-12 minutes, then remove the parchment paper and weights and bake for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Allow the crust to cool completely before filling it with your desired tart filling.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as rice flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that different flours have different textures and absorbencies, so you may need to adjust the amount of liquid in the recipe.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this crust ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can prepare the dough and refrigerate it for up to 2 days before rolling it out and baking. You can also freeze the dough for up to 3 months. Just make sure to thaw it in the refrigerator before using.</p>

    <h3>Can I use this crust for sweet and savory tarts?</h3>
    <p>Yes, this gluten-free tart crust is versatile and can be used for both sweet and savory tarts. For sweet tarts, you can add a tablespoon of sugar to the dough if desired.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of xanthan gum?</h3>
    <p>If you don't have xanthan gum, you can use guar gum or psyllium husk as a substitute. These ingredients also help to bind the dough together and give it a similar texture to traditional crusts.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Making a gluten-free tart crust doesn't have to be complicated or time-consuming. With the right ingredients and a little bit of patience, you can create a delicious and flaky crust that is perfect for any tart recipe.
