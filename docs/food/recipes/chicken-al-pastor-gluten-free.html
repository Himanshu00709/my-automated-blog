    <h1>Chicken Al Pastor Gluten-Free: A Flavorful and Healthy Twist</h1>

    <h2>The Origins of Al Pastor</h2>

When prepared gluten-free, this dish becomes accessible to a wider audience, including those with dietary restrictions.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Marinade:</strong> In a blender, combine the achiote paste, pineapple juice, white vinegar, garlic, oregano, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper. Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> Place the chicken thighs in a large bowl or resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring each piece is well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong> Preheat your grill or skillet to medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade, shaking off any excess. Grill the chicken for 6-8 minutes per side, or until fully cooked and slightly charred. During the last few minutes of cooking, add the pineapple slices to the grill to caramelize them.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Slice the chicken into thin strips and serve with the grilled pineapple slices. You can also serve it with gluten-free tortillas, rice, or a fresh salad.</li>
