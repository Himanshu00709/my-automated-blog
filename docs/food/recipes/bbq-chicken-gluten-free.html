    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free BBQ Chicken</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free BBQ chicken is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a flavorful and safe dish:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Start by selecting fresh chicken pieces, such as thighs, drumsticks, or breasts. Rinse the chicken under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels. This helps the marinade adhere better to the meat.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Make the Marinade</h3>
    <p>In a bowl, combine gluten-free soy sauce or tamari, olive oil, minced garlic, honey, and your choice of gluten-free spices. Mix well and pour the marinade over the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for maximum flavor.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Grill the Chicken</h3>
    <p>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade and let any excess drip off. Place the chicken on the grill and cook for about 6-8 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Add the BBQ Sauce</h3>
    <p>During the last few minutes of grilling, brush the chicken with gluten-free BBQ sauce. Be sure to use a clean brush to avoid cross-contamination. Grill for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the sauce to caramelize.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once the chicken is fully cooked, remove it from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes. Serve with your favorite gluten-free sides, such as grilled vegetables, coleslaw, or a fresh salad.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free BBQ Chicken</h2>
    <p>Here are some additional tips to ensure your gluten-free BBQ chicken turns out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check Labels:</strong> Always read ingredient labels to ensure they are gluten-free. Look for certifications from reputable organizations.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Cross-Contamination:</strong> Use separate utensils, cutting boards, and grilling tools for gluten-free foods. Clean your grill thoroughly before use.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Don’t be afraid to try different gluten-free BBQ sauces and marinades to find your favorite combination.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Cooking Time:</strong> Overcooking can dry out the chicken, so keep an eye on the internal temperature using a meat thermometer.</li>
    </ul>
