    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Gluten-Free Pasta</h3>
    <p>Start by cooking the gluten-free pasta according to the package instructions. Be sure to cook it al dente, as it will continue to cook slightly when mixed with the sauce later. Once cooked, drain the pasta and set it aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Shrimp</h3>
    <p>While the pasta is cooking, prepare the shrimp. Make sure they are peeled and deveined. Pat them dry with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture, which will help them sear properly in the pan.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Make the Garlic Butter Sauce</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, heat the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1-2 minutes, or until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic, as it can become bitter. If you like a bit of heat, add the red pepper flakes at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Shrimp</h3>
    <p>Add the shrimp to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they turn pink and opaque. Be careful not to overcook the shrimp, as they can become tough and rubbery.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Wine and Lemon Juice</h3>
    <p>Once the shrimp are cooked, pour in the white wine and lemon juice. Let the mixture simmer for about 2-3 minutes, allowing the alcohol to cook off and the flavors to meld together.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Combine the Pasta and Sauce</h3>
    <p>Add the cooked gluten-free pasta to the skillet and toss everything together until the pasta is well-coated with the sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, you can add a splash of pasta water to loosen it up.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Finally, garnish the dish with freshly chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese, if desired. Serve immediately while hot, and enjoy your gluten-free shrimp scampi!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen shrimp for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen shrimp. Just make sure to thaw them completely and pat them dry before cooking to ensure they sear properly.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of white wine?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer not to use wine, you can substitute it with chicken or vegetable broth. The flavor will be slightly different, but it will still be delicious.</p>

        <h3>Is this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>This recipe contains butter and optional Parmesan cheese, so it is not dairy-free. However, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative and omit the cheese if needed.</p>

        <h3>Can I add vegetables to this dish?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can add vegetables like spinach, cherry tomatoes, or zucchini to make the dish more nutritious. Just sauté them along with the garlic before adding the shrimp.</p>
