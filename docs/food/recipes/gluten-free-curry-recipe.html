    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the cooking process. Follow these steps to create a delicious gluten-free curry:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Base</h3>
    <p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut√© until it becomes translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and cook for another 2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Curry Paste</h3>
    <p>Stir in the gluten-free curry paste and cook for 1-2 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. This step is crucial as it helps to release the aromatic compounds in the curry paste, giving your dish a deeper flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Protein</h3>
    <p>Add the chicken or tofu to the pan and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides. If you're using chicken, make sure it is cooked through before proceeding to the next step.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Vegetables and Coconut Milk</h3>
    <p>Add the sliced bell peppers and zucchini to the pan, stirring to coat them in the curry paste. Pour in the coconut milk and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for about 10-15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the sauce has thickened slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Season and Garnish</h3>
    <p>Season the curry with salt and pepper to taste. Just before serving, sprinkle the chopped cilantro over the top and serve with lime wedges on the side. The lime adds a refreshing zing that complements the rich flavors of the curry.</p>
