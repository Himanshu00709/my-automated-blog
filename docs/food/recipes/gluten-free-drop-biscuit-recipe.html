<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C). This high temperature is essential for achieving the perfect rise and golden-brown crust on your biscuits.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure they are evenly distributed.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cut in the Butter</h3>
<p>Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. This step is crucial for creating a flaky texture in your biscuits.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add the Milk</h3>
<p>Pour the milk (or dairy-free alternative) into the bowl and stir until the dough just comes together. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough biscuits. If you prefer a slightly sweeter biscuit, you can add a tablespoon or two of honey or sugar at this stage.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Drop the Dough</h3>
<p>Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop portions of the dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Space them about 2 inches apart to allow for spreading during baking.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
<p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown on top. Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Drop Biscuits</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Cold Butter:</strong> Cold butter is key to achieving a flaky texture. If the butter melts before baking, your biscuits may turn out dense.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough biscuits. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add herbs, cheese, or spices to the dough for a savory twist, or mix in dried fruit and cinnamon for a sweet variation.</li>
    <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Store leftover biscuits in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or freeze for longer storage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, such as almond flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these biscuits dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a dairy-free milk like almond or oat milk.</p>

    <h3>Why are my biscuits dense?</h3>
    <p>Dense biscuits can result from overmixing the dough or using warm butter. Ensure your butter is cold and mix the dough just until combined.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze the dough?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the dough before baking. Drop the dough onto a baking sheet, freeze until solid, then transfer to a freezer bag. Bake directly from frozen, adding a few extra minutes to the baking time.</p>
