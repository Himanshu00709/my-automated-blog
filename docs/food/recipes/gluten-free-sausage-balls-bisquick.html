<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free sausage balls is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create a batch of delicious, gluten-free sausage balls:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your sausage balls will cook evenly and achieve that perfect golden-brown color.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Combine the Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free Bisquick, ground sausage, shredded cheddar cheese, milk, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Mix everything together until well combined. The mixture should be slightly sticky but hold together when rolled into balls.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Shape the Sausage Balls</h3>
<p>Using your hands or a small cookie scoop, shape the mixture into 1-inch balls. Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving a little space between each one to allow for even cooking.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Bake the Sausage Balls</h3>
<p>Bake the sausage balls in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. You can check for doneness by cutting one open to ensure the sausage is fully cooked.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Once the sausage balls are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Serve them warm with your favorite dipping sauce, such as ranch dressing or marinara sauce.</p>
