<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>

<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you're ready to bake the pizookie.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Skillet</h3>

<p>Lightly grease a 10-inch cast-iron skillet or oven-safe dish with butter or non-stick cooking spray. This will prevent the pizookie from sticking to the skillet and make it easier to serve.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. This ensures that the dry ingredients are evenly distributed, which is crucial for achieving the perfect cookie texture.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Cream the Butter and Sugars</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This process incorporates air into the mixture, which helps the pizookie rise and become tender.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Add the Egg and Vanilla</h3>

<p>Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined. The egg acts as a binding agent, while the vanilla adds a rich, aromatic flavor to the pizookie.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>

<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense pizookie.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Fold in the Chocolate Chips</h3>

<p>Gently fold in the chocolate chips until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough. You can also add other mix-ins like nuts or dried fruit if desired.</p>

<h3>Step 8: Bake the Pizookie</h3>

<p>Press the dough evenly into the prepared skillet. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the center is set. The center may still be slightly soft, but it will continue to cook as it cools.</p>

<h3>Step 9: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Remove the pizookie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. The contrast between the warm cookie and cold ice cream is simply irresistible!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours like almond flour or oat flour, but the texture and flavor may vary slightly. Be sure to adjust the quantity as needed, as different flours have different absorption rates.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter. Additionally, use dairy-free chocolate chips and ice cream to make the entire recipe dairy-free.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftovers?</h3>
    <p>If you have any leftovers (which is rare!), store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. You can also refrigerate the pizookie for up to a week, but be sure to reheat it before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze the pizookie?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked pizookie. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, then store it in the freezer for up to 3 months. Thaw it in the refrigerator overnight and reheat in the oven before serving.</p>
