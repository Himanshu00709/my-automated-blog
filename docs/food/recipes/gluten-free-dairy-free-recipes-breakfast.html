    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I substitute almond flour with another gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours like coconut flour, oat flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. However, keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>2. Are these recipes suitable for vegans?</h3>
        <p>Most of these recipes can be made vegan by substituting eggs with flax eggs or chia eggs. For example, in the pancake recipe, you can replace the eggs with 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed mixed with 6 tablespoons of water.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I prepare these recipes ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Chia seed pudding is perfect for meal prep as it needs to sit overnight. Pancakes can also be made in advance and reheated in the toaster or microwave. Avocado toast is best made fresh to prevent the avocado from browning.</p>
