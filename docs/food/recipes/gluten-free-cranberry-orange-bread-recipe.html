    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the steps to make this delicious gluten-free cranberry orange bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan and line it with parchment paper, leaving some overhang on the sides for easy removal.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Then, mix in the orange zest, orange juice, and Greek yogurt. The mixture should be smooth and well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense loaf.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in Cranberries</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the cranberries using a spatula. If you’re using frozen cranberries, there’s no need to thaw them beforehand.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve!</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use a different gluten-free flour blend, but make sure it’s a 1:1 substitute for all-purpose flour. Almond flour or coconut flour won’t work as a direct substitute in this recipe.</p>

        <h3>Can I use dried cranberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use dried cranberries, but keep in mind that they are sweeter and less tart than fresh cranberries. You may want to reduce the sugar slightly if using dried cranberries.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this recipe vegan by substituting the butter with coconut oil, the eggs with flax eggs, and the Greek yogurt with a plant-based yogurt.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free cranberry orange bread is a delightful treat that’s perfect for any occasion. It’s easy to make, packed with flavor, and sure to impress even the most discerning palates.
