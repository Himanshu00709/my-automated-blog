    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making this delicious gluten-free chocolate chip banana bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your oven is at the right temperature when you're ready to bake, which is crucial for even cooking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. This helps to evenly distribute the leavening agents and ensures a consistent texture in your banana bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate large bowl, combine the mashed bananas, melted butter, granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined. The bananas should be fully mashed to ensure a smooth batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense loaf. Once the batter is smooth, fold in the gluten-free chocolate chips.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Banana Bread</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into a greased 9x5 inch loaf pan. Smooth the top with a spatula, then place it in the preheated oven. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. If the top starts to brown too quickly, you can cover it loosely with aluminum foil.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the banana bread is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing. This helps to set the structure of the bread and makes it easier to slice.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Banana Bread</h2>
    <p>Here are some additional tips to ensure your gluten-free chocolate chip banana bread turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use ripe bananas:</strong> The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more flavorful your bread will be. Look for bananas with brown spots on the skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense loaf. Mix until just combined for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking your bread at the 50-minute mark. A toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Once cooled, store your banana bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as almond flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and use a plant-based butter alternative.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze the banana bread?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free banana bread freezes well. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil before placing it in the freezer. It can be stored for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>What if I don't have chocolate chips?</h3>
        <p>If you don't have chocolate chips, you can omit them or substitute with nuts, dried fruit, or even a swirl of peanut butter for a different flavor profile.</p>
    </div>
