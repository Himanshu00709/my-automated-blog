    <h1>Gluten-Free Pizza Rustica Recipe: A Delicious Twist on a Classic Dish</h1>
    <p>Pizza Rustica, also known as Easter Pie, is a traditional Italian dish that combines the rich flavors of cured meats, cheeses, and eggs in a savory pie. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying this classic dish might seem challenging, but with the right ingredients and techniques, you can create a gluten-free version that is just as delicious. In this blog post, we’ll guide you through a step-by-step recipe for making a gluten-free Pizza Rustica that will impress your family and friends.</p>

    <h2>What is Pizza Rustica?</h2>
    <p>Pizza Rustica is a savory pie that originates from Southern Italy, particularly popular during Easter celebrations. Unlike the typical pizza, this dish is more akin to a quiche or a savory tart, filled with a mixture of cured meats, cheeses, and eggs, all encased in a flaky pastry crust. The combination of salty meats and creamy cheeses creates a rich and satisfying flavor profile that is perfect for any occasion.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause inflammation and damage to the small intestine in those who are intolerant. By opting for a gluten-free version of Pizza Rustica, you can enjoy this traditional dish without compromising your health. Additionally, gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular for their potential health benefits, including improved digestion and reduced inflammation.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Gluten-Free Pastry</h3>
    <p>Start by making the gluten-free pastry dough. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add one egg and mix until the dough comes together. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the filling. In a large bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and provolone cheese. Add the cooked Italian sausage, chopped prosciutto, and sliced pepperoni. In a separate bowl, whisk together the remaining three eggs and add them to the cheese and meat mixture. Season with salt, black pepper, and fresh parsley. Mix everything until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Pizza Rustica</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Carefully transfer the dough to the pie dish, pressing it gently into the bottom and sides. Trim any excess dough from the edges. Pour the filling into the prepared crust and spread it evenly. If desired, you can create a lattice top with the remaining dough or simply cover the pie with another layer of rolled-out dough. Seal the edges and cut a few small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Pizza Rustica</h3>
    <p>Place the pie dish on a baking sheet to catch any drips and bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is set. Remove from the oven and let it cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. However, make sure that the blend is suitable for baking and has a good texture for pastry. Some popular options include almond flour, rice flour, or a pre-mixed gluten-free flour blend.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>While the traditional recipe includes dairy products like ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan, you can experiment with dairy-free alternatives. Look for dairy-free cheese substitutes and use a dairy-free butter alternative for the pastry. Keep in mind that the flavor and texture may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>How long does Pizza Rustica last?</h3>
        <p>Pizza Rustica can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. Make sure to cover it tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. You can also freeze it for up to 2 months. To reheat, place it in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) until warmed through.</p>
