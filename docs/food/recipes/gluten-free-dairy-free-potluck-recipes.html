    <p>Yes, most of these recipes can be made ahead of time. The stuffed mushrooms, quinoa salad, and chocolate mousse can all be prepared the day before and stored in the refrigerator. The banana bread can also be made a day or two in advance and stored at room temperature.</p>

    <h3>2. Are these recipes suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>Most of these recipes are vegan-friendly, with the exception of the chicken stir-fry. However, you can easily substitute the chicken with tofu or another plant-based protein to make it vegan.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>If you don’t have a gluten intolerance, you can use regular flour in place of gluten-free flour. However, keep in mind that this will make the recipe unsuitable for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>

    <h3>4. What can I use instead of dairy-free cheese?</h3>
