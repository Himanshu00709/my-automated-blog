<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners and set aside. This ensures that your cupcakes will come out easily once baked.</p>

<h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make sure there are no lumps, as this will ensure a smooth batter.</p>

<h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving the perfect texture in your cupcakes.</p>

<h3>4. Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
<p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract. This will give your cupcakes a rich flavor and help bind the ingredients together.</p>

<h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk. Start and end with the dry ingredients. This method helps to create a smooth and well-incorporated batter.</p>

<h3>6. Add Food Coloring and Vinegar</h3>
<p>Stir in the red food coloring until the batter reaches your desired shade of red. Then, mix in the white vinegar. The vinegar reacts with the baking soda to help the cupcakes rise and become fluffy.</p>

<h3>7. Fill and Bake</h3>
<p>Divide the batter evenly among the prepared cupcake liners, filling each about two-thirds full. Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

<h3>8. Cool and Frost</h3>
<p>Allow the cupcakes to cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, frost with your favorite gluten-free cream cheese frosting or buttercream frosting.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. Just make sure it’s a 1:1 substitute for all-purpose flour. Some popular options include almond flour, coconut flour, or a store-bought gluten-free flour blend.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these cupcakes dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the buttermilk with a dairy-free alternative like almond milk or coconut milk. For the butter, use a dairy-free margarine or coconut oil.</p>

    <h3>How do I store gluten-free red velvet cupcakes?</h3>
    <p>Store the cupcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. If you’ve frosted them with cream cheese frosting, it’s best to store them in the refrigerator.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze these cupcakes?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the unfrosted cupcakes for up to 3 months. Wrap them individually in plastic wrap and place them in a freezer-safe container. Thaw at room temperature before frosting and serving.</p>
</div>
