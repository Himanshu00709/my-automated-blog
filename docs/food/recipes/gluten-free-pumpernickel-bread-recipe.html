<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Yeast Mixture</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, combine the warm water (around 110°F) with the active dry yeast and a teaspoon of sugar. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the yeast becomes frothy. This step ensures that your yeast is active and ready to help the bread rise.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, ground flaxseed, psyllium husk powder, cocoa powder, instant coffee granules, and salt. Whisk these ingredients together until well combined. The cocoa powder and coffee granules are essential for achieving the deep, rich color and flavor characteristic of pumpernickel bread.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Add the molasses, apple cider vinegar, and olive oil to the yeast mixture. Pour this wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until a dough forms. The dough will be sticky, but this is normal for gluten-free bread. If the dough is too dry, you can add a little more warm water, one tablespoon at a time.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Let the Dough Rise</h3>
<p>Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour. The dough should double in size. If your kitchen is cool, you can place the dough in a slightly warmed oven (turned off) to help it rise.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Shape and Bake the Bread</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Once the dough has risen, transfer it to a greased loaf pan. Smooth the top with a wet spatula or your hands. Bake the bread for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The crust should be dark and firm.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and serve with your favorite toppings, such as avocado, hummus, or almond butter.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pumpernickel Bread</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. However, keep in mind that different flours may affect the texture and flavor of the bread. A blend of rice flour, almond flour, and tapioca flour works well for this recipe.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I make this bread without yeast?</h3>
    <p>While yeast is essential for traditional pumpernickel bread, you can experiment with a yeast-free version by using baking powder or baking soda as a leavening agent. However, the texture and flavor will be different.</p>

    <h3>3. How should I store gluten-free pumpernickel bread?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free bread tends to dry out faster than regular bread. Store it in an airtight container or plastic wrap at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the bread for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I add nuts or seeds to the bread?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Adding nuts or seeds, such as sunflower seeds or chopped walnuts, can enhance the texture and nutritional value of the bread. Simply fold them into the dough before baking.</p>
