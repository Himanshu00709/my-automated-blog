<h1>Gluten-Free Olive Oil Cake Recipe</h1>

<p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance but also among health-conscious individuals looking to reduce their gluten intake. One of the most delightful and versatile gluten-free desserts you can make is an olive oil cake. This cake is moist, flavorful, and incredibly easy to prepare. In this blog post, we’ll walk you through a detailed recipe for a gluten-free olive oil cake, along with tips, variations, and answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Olive Oil for Baking?</h2>

<p>Olive oil is a fantastic ingredient for baking, especially in gluten-free recipes. It adds moisture to the cake, which is crucial when working with gluten-free flours that can sometimes result in dry baked goods. Additionally, olive oil imparts a rich, fruity flavor that complements the other ingredients beautifully. Extra virgin olive oil is the best choice for this recipe, as it has a more pronounced flavor and higher nutritional value compared to refined olive oils.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>Before we dive into the recipe, let’s take a look at the ingredients you’ll need:</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with olive oil and line the bottom with parchment paper to ensure easy removal of the cake after baking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar and olive oil until well combined. Add the eggs one at a time, whisking after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract, lemon zest, and lemon juice.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake. Finally, stir in the milk until the batter is smooth and well incorporated.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake the Cake</h3>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can dust the cake with powdered sugar or serve it with a dollop of whipped cream or fresh berries.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. A blend that includes rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch works well for this recipe. Avoid using single-grain flours like almond or coconut flour alone, as they can result in a dense cake.</li>
    <li><strong>Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> Make sure your eggs and milk are at room temperature before you start. This helps the ingredients blend more easily and results in a smoother batter.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a tough cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> While this recipe uses lemon zest and juice, you can experiment with other flavors like orange zest, almond extract, or even a splash of liqueur.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of oil?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use other oils like coconut oil or vegetable oil, but keep in mind that the flavor will be different. Olive oil adds a unique richness to the cake that other oils may not provide.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Simply replace the milk with a dairy-free alternative like almond milk, oat milk, or coconut milk.</p>

    <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
    <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>Can I add toppings to the cake?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can top the cake with fresh fruit, a glaze, or even a dusting of powdered sugar. Get creative with your toppings to make the cake your own!</p>
