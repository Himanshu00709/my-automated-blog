    <h1>Gluten-Free Burrito Recipe: A Delicious and Healthy Option</h1>

    <p>Burritos are a beloved dish worldwide, known for their versatility and flavor. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying a traditional burrito can be challenging due to the gluten in flour tortillas.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>Start by heating olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and bell peppers, sautéing them until they are soft and slightly caramelized. If you’re using grilled chicken or tofu, add it to the skillet and cook until heated through. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set the filling aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Warm the Tortillas</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free tortillas can sometimes be less pliable than regular ones, so it’s important to warm them before assembling the burritos. You can do this by placing them in a dry skillet over low heat for about 10-15 seconds on each side, or by wrapping them in a damp paper towel and microwaving them for 20-30 seconds.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Burritos</h3>
    <p>Lay a warmed tortilla flat on a clean surface. Start by spreading a layer of cooked rice in the center, followed by the black beans, sautéed vegetables, and protein of your choice. Add avocado slices, shredded cheese, and a drizzle of salsa. Sprinkle fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice over the top for added flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Fold and Roll</h3>
    <p>To fold the burrito, start by folding the sides of the tortilla inward, then roll it up tightly from the bottom, ensuring all the fillings are securely enclosed. Repeat this process for the remaining tortillas.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Your gluten-free burritos are now ready to serve! You can enjoy them as is, or for an extra touch, lightly grill them in a skillet to achieve a crispy exterior. Serve with additional salsa, guacamole, or sour cream on the side.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Burritos</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use corn tortillas instead of gluten-free tortillas?</h3>
        <p>Yes, corn tortillas are naturally gluten-free and can be used as an alternative. However, they are typically smaller and less pliable, so you may need to use two tortillas per burrito or make smaller wraps.</p>

        <h3>2. Are all store-bought tortillas gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>No, not all store-bought tortillas are gluten-free. Always check the label to ensure they are certified gluten-free, especially if you have celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make this recipe vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply omit the cheese and use tofu or a plant-based protein instead of chicken. You can also add more vegetables like zucchini or mushrooms for extra flavor and texture.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I store leftover gluten-free burritos?</h3>
        <p>Leftover burritos can be wrapped in foil or plastic wrap and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply microwave them for 1-2 minutes or warm them in a skillet until heated through.</p>
