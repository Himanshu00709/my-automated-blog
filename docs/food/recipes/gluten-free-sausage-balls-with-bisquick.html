    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your sausage balls will bake evenly and achieve that perfect golden-brown color.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Combine the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free Bisquick, ground sausage, shredded cheddar cheese, and milk. If you’d like to add extra flavor, this is the time to mix in garlic powder, onion powder, or any other seasonings you prefer. Use your hands or a sturdy spoon to mix everything together until well combined. The mixture should be slightly sticky but hold together when rolled into balls.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Sausage Balls</h3>
    <p>Using your hands, roll the mixture into 1-inch balls. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Make sure to space them out evenly to allow for even baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Bake the sausage balls in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. You can check for doneness by cutting one open to ensure there’s no pink in the center.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Once baked, let the sausage balls cool for a few minutes before serving. They’re best enjoyed warm, either on their own or with your favorite dipping sauce, such as ranch or marinara.</p>

    <h2>Tips and Variations</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips and variations to make your gluten-free sausage balls even more delicious:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Different Cheeses:</strong> While cheddar is the classic choice, you can experiment with other cheeses like pepper jack, mozzarella, or even a blend for a unique flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Vegetables:</strong> For a healthier twist, consider adding finely chopped vegetables like spinach, bell peppers, or onions to the mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Them Spicy:</strong> If you enjoy a bit of heat, use spicy sausage or add a pinch of cayenne pepper to the mix.</li>
        <li><strong>Freeze for Later:</strong> These sausage balls freeze beautifully. Simply place them in a single layer on a baking sheet to freeze, then transfer to a freezer-safe bag. Reheat in the oven when ready to serve.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free baking mix?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free baking mix as a substitute for Bisquick. Just make sure it has a similar consistency and includes a leavening agent like baking powder.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these sausage balls dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply use a dairy-free cheese alternative and a non-dairy milk like almond or oat milk. The texture and flavor may vary slightly, but they’ll still be delicious.</p>
