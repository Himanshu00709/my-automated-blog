<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3>
<p>Start by cutting the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, then coat it evenly with cornstarch. This will help create a crispy exterior when the chicken is cooked.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Cook the Chicken</h3>
<p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until they are golden brown on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Prepare the Honey Glaze</h3>
<p>In the same skillet, add the minced garlic and grated ginger. Sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant. Then, add the gluten-free soy sauce and honey, stirring to combine. Allow the mixture to simmer for 2-3 minutes until it thickens slightly.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine and Serve</h3>
<p>Return the cooked chicken to the skillet, tossing it in the honey glaze until each piece is well-coated. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to ensure the chicken is heated through. Garnish with chopped green onions and serve immediately.</p>
