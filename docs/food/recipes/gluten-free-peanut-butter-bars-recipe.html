Peanut butter bars are a classic treat, and making them gluten-free ensures that everyone can enjoy them without compromising on taste or texture.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Base</h3>
    <p>Start by lining an 8x8 inch baking dish with parchment paper. This will make it easier to remove the bars once they're set. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free rolled oats, peanut butter, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract. Mix until all the ingredients are well combined and the mixture sticks together.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Press the Mixture into the Pan</h3>
    <p>Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish and press it down firmly using the back of a spoon or your hands. Make sure the mixture is evenly distributed and compacted, as this will help the bars hold their shape once they're cut.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Melt the Chocolate</h3>
    <p>In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the dark chocolate chips in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate is smooth and fully melted. Alternatively, you can melt the chocolate using a double boiler on the stovetop.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Chocolate Layer</h3>
    <p>Pour the melted chocolate over the peanut butter and oat mixture, spreading it evenly with a spatula. Sprinkle a pinch of sea salt over the chocolate for a touch of contrast and added flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Chill and Set</h3>
    <p>Place the baking dish in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or until the chocolate layer is fully set. Once set, remove the bars from the dish using the parchment paper and cut them into squares or rectangles.</p>
