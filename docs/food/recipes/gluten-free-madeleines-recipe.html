    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions for making gluten-free madeleines.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Madeleine Pan</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease your madeleine pan with butter or a non-stick cooking spray. Dust the pan with a little gluten-free flour, tapping out any excess. This will help the madeleines release easily after baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Beat the Eggs and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, beat the eggs and granulated sugar together using an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the mixture is pale, thick, and has doubled in volume. This should take about 3-4 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and mix until combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the dry ingredients into the egg mixture using a spatula. Be careful not to overmix, as this can deflate the batter and result in dense madeleines. Once the dry ingredients are mostly incorporated, add the melted butter and fold until just combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fill the Madeleine Pan</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter into the prepared madeleine pan, filling each mold about 3/4 full. You can also use a piping bag for more precision. Tap the pan gently on the counter to release any air bubbles.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Madeleines</h3>
    <p>Bake the madeleines in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers spring back when lightly touched. Be careful not to overbake, as this can dry out the madeleines.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Remove the madeleines from the oven and let them cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve the madeleines as is, or dust them with powdered sugar for an extra touch of sweetness.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Madeleines</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free madeleines can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be well on your way to success:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense, tough madeleines. Fold the ingredients together gently until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> A properly preheated oven is crucial for achieving the right texture and rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Use room temperature eggs:</strong> Room temperature eggs will incorporate more air, resulting in lighter madeleines.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Madeleines</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. A blend that includes almond flour or coconut flour can add a nice nutty flavor, but you may need to adjust the liquid content of the batter.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these madeleines dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or a plant-based butter. Just make sure to use a product that has a similar fat content to butter for best results.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free madeleines?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free madeleines are best enjoyed fresh, but they can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to a month. Just thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add flavorings to the batter?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize your madeleines by adding different flavorings, such as lemon zest, orange zest, or even a touch of almond extract. Just be sure to add these ingredients when you’re mixing the wet ingredients.</p>
