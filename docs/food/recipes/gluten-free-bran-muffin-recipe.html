<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the process of making these delicious gluten-free bran muffins.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with coconut oil to prevent sticking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free oat bran, gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk thoroughly to ensure even distribution of the leavening agents.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, applesauce, milk, honey (or maple syrup), melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Mix until smooth and well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir gently until just combined. Avoid overmixing, as this can lead to dense muffins. If you’re adding optional ingredients like raisins or nuts, fold them in at this stage.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Fill the Muffin Tin</h3>
<p>Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about ¾ full. This allows room for the muffins to rise without overflowing.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
<p>Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 18–20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The tops should be golden brown.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Remove the muffins from the oven and let them cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or store for later.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Bran Muffins</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different flour blend?</h3>
