    <h1>Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Black and White Cookies: A Delicious Twist on a Classic</h1>
    <p>Black and white cookies are a beloved treat, known for their iconic half-and-half design and soft, cake-like texture. Traditionally, these cookies are made with wheat flour and dairy, which can be problematic for those with dietary restrictions. However, with the rise of gluten-free and dairy-free diets, bakers have found innovative ways to recreate this classic cookie without compromising on taste or texture. In this blog post, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free dairy-free black and white cookies, offering tips, recipes, and insights to help you enjoy this delightful treat.</p>

    <h2>What Are Black and White Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Black and white cookies, also known as "half-moon cookies," are a staple in New York City bakeries. These cookies are characterized by their round shape, soft texture, and distinctive icing—half vanilla and half chocolate. The combination of flavors and textures makes them a favorite among cookie enthusiasts. However, traditional recipes rely heavily on gluten-containing flour and dairy products, which can be a challenge for those with dietary restrictions.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free and Dairy-Free?</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or lactose intolerance, consuming gluten or dairy can lead to uncomfortable symptoms such as bloating, stomach pain, and digestive issues. Additionally, some people choose to avoid these ingredients for personal health reasons or ethical beliefs. Fortunately, with the right ingredients and techniques, it’s possible to create gluten-free dairy-free black and white cookies that are just as delicious as the original.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Black and White Cookies</h2>
    <p>Now that we’ve covered the key ingredients, let’s dive into a step-by-step recipe for making gluten-free dairy-free black and white cookies at home.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dairy-free butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg or egg replacer</li>
        <li>1 tsp gluten-free vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 cup non-dairy milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Icing:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp non-dairy milk</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp gluten-free vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, cream together the dairy-free butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg (or egg replacer) and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the non-dairy milk, until a smooth dough forms.</li>
        <li>Scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheet, forming round cookies about 2-3 inches in diameter. Flatten slightly with the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>While the cookies cool, prepare the icing. In a small bowl, mix together the powdered sugar, non-dairy milk, and vanilla extract until smooth. Divide the icing into two bowls. Add cocoa powder to one bowl and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Once the cookies are cool, spread the vanilla icing on one half of each cookie and the chocolate icing on the other half. Allow the icing to set before serving.</li>
    </ol>
