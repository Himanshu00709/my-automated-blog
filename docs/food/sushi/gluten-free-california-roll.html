<h2>How to Make a Gluten-Free California Roll</h2>

<p>Making a Gluten-Free California Roll is similar to making a traditional California Roll, with a few key adjustments to ensure it’s gluten-free. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Sushi Rice</h3>
<p>Start by rinsing the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Cook the rice according to the package instructions. Once cooked, season the rice with a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Fillings</h3>
<p>While the rice is cooling, prepare your fillings. Slice the cucumber and avocado into thin strips. If you’re using imitation crab, ensure it’s gluten-free. You can also use real crab meat for a more authentic flavor.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble the Roll</h3>
<p>Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat. Spread a thin layer of sushi rice evenly over the nori, leaving a small border at the top. Flip the nori over so the rice is facing down. Place the cucumber, avocado, and crab in the center of the nori. Roll the sushi tightly using the bamboo mat, pressing gently to ensure it holds together.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Slice and Serve</h3>
<p>Using a sharp knife, slice the roll into even pieces. Serve with gluten-free soy sauce or tamari and enjoy!</p>
