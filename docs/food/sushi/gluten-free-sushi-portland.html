<h1>Gluten-Free Sushi in Portland: A Culinary Adventure</h1>

<p>Portland, Oregon, is renowned for its vibrant food scene, and sushi lovers are in for a treat. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding safe and delicious sushi can be a challenge. However, Portland’s culinary landscape is rich with options that cater to gluten-free diners. In this article, we’ll explore the best gluten-free sushi spots in Portland, what makes them stand out, and how you can enjoy sushi without compromising your dietary needs.</p>

<h2>Why Gluten-Free Sushi?</h2>

<p>Sushi is traditionally made with rice, fish, and vegetables, which are naturally gluten-free. However, many sushi rolls and sauces contain hidden gluten, such as soy sauce, imitation crab, or tempura batter. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming even small amounts of gluten can lead to serious health issues. Fortunately, Portland’s sushi restaurants are increasingly aware of these dietary restrictions and offer gluten-free options that are both safe and delicious.</p>

<h2>What to Look for in Gluten-Free Sushi</h2>

<p>When dining out for gluten-free sushi, it’s important to be vigilant. Here are some tips to ensure your meal is safe:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ask About Soy Sauce:</strong> Traditional soy sauce contains wheat, so always ask if the restaurant offers gluten-free soy sauce or tamari.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Cross-Contamination:</strong> Ensure that the restaurant has protocols in place to prevent cross-contamination, such as using separate utensils and preparation areas.</li>
    <li><strong>Read the Menu Carefully:</strong> Look for gluten-free labels or ask the staff for recommendations. Be cautious of rolls that contain tempura or imitation crab, as these often contain gluten.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Gluten-Free Sushi at Home</h2>

<p>If you prefer to make sushi at home, it’s easier than you might think. Here’s a simple guide to creating gluten-free sushi:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Choose Gluten-Free Ingredients:</strong> Use sushi rice, fresh fish, and vegetables. Ensure that any sauces or condiments are gluten-free.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Rice:</strong> Rinse the sushi rice thoroughly and cook it according to the package instructions. Season with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt.</li>
    <li><strong>Assemble the Rolls:</strong> Lay out a sheet of nori (seaweed) on a bamboo sushi mat. Spread a thin layer of rice over the nori, leaving a small border at the top. Add your fillings and roll tightly using the mat.</li>
    <li><strong>Slice and Serve:</strong> Use a sharp knife to slice the roll into pieces. Serve with gluten-free soy sauce and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
