    <h1>Gluten-Free California Rolls: A Delicious and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>California rolls are a popular sushi dish that has won the hearts of many sushi lovers around the world. Traditionally, California rolls are made with sushi rice, nori (seaweed), imitation crab, cucumber, and avocado. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, the traditional California roll can be a bit of a challenge due to the presence of gluten in some of its ingredients, particularly in the imitation crab.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free California Rolls</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free California rolls at home is easier than you might think. Follow this step-by-step guide to create your own delicious and healthy rolls.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Sushi Rice</h3>

    <p>Start by rinsing your sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming too sticky. Cook the rice according to the package instructions. Once cooked, transfer the rice to a large bowl and gently fold in a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature before using.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Fillings</h3>

    <p>While the rice is cooling, prepare your fillings. If you're using real crab meat, ensure it's cooked and shredded. If you're using gluten-free imitation crab, simply slice it into thin strips. Slice the cucumber and avocado into thin strips as well. Set these aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Rolls</h3>

    <p>Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat. Spread a thin layer of sushi rice evenly over the nori, leaving about an inch of space at the top. Flip the nori over so the rice is facing down. Place a strip of crab, cucumber, and avocado in the center of the nori. Using the bamboo mat, roll the nori tightly from the bottom, pressing gently as you go. Once rolled, use a sharp knife to slice the roll into even pieces.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Arrange your gluten-free California rolls on a plate and serve with gluten-free soy sauce or tamari. You can also garnish with pickled ginger and wasabi if desired. Enjoy your homemade gluten-free California rolls!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free California Rolls</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular soy sauce for gluten-free California rolls?</h3>
        <p>No, regular soy sauce contains gluten. You should use tamari or a gluten-free soy sauce to ensure your rolls are completely gluten-free.</p>

        <h3>2. Is imitation crab always gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>No, most imitation crab contains wheat-based fillers. Always check the label or opt for real crab meat or a certified gluten-free imitation crab.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I make California rolls without a bamboo sushi mat?</h3>
        <p>While a bamboo sushi mat makes rolling easier, you can still make California rolls without one. Simply use a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap to help roll the sushi.</p>

        <h3>4. Are California rolls healthy?</h3>
        <p>California rolls can be a healthy option, especially when made with gluten-free ingredients. They are low in fat and provide a good source of protein, vitamins, and minerals.</p>
