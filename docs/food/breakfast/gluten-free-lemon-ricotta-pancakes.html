    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s get started with the step-by-step instructions to make these gluten-free lemon ricotta pancakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dry Ingredients</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that all the dry ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in your batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>

    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, eggs, milk, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and well incorporated. The ricotta cheese should be evenly distributed throughout the mixture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>

    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix the batter, as this can result in dense pancakes. A few lumps in the batter are perfectly fine and will help keep the pancakes light and fluffy.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cook the Pancakes</h3>

    <p>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or oil. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, then flip the pancake and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown. Repeat with the remaining batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings. Maple syrup, fresh berries, and a dollop of whipped cream are excellent choices. Enjoy your gluten-free lemon ricotta pancakes with a cup of coffee or tea for a complete breakfast experience.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pancakes</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free pancakes can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to achieve perfect results every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking and contains a mix of flours like rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough pancakes. Mix the batter until just combined, and don’t worry about a few lumps.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Batter Rest:</strong> Allowing the batter to rest for 5-10 minutes before cooking can help the gluten-free flours absorb the liquid, resulting in a better texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook on Medium Heat:</strong> Cooking pancakes on medium heat ensures that they cook evenly without burning. If the heat is too high, the outside may cook too quickly while the inside remains undercooked.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Lemon Ricotta Pancakes</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese instead of ricotta?</h3>
        <p>Ricotta cheese is key to the texture and flavor of these pancakes, but you can experiment with other soft cheeses like cottage cheese or mascarpone. Keep in mind that the flavor and texture may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these pancakes dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these pancakes dairy-free by using a dairy-free ricotta cheese alternative and a non-dairy milk like almond milk or oat milk. Be sure to check the labels to ensure all ingredients are gluten-free and dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover pancakes?</h3>
        <p>Leftover pancakes can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply warm them in a toaster or microwave until heated through.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze these pancakes?</h3>
        <p>Yes, these pancakes freeze well. Place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze until solid, then transfer to a freezer-safe bag or container. They can be reheated directly from the freezer in a toaster or oven.</p>
