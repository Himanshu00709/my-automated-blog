    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg and then add the milk, molasses, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and melted coconut oil. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the pancakes dense.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with coconut oil or butter.</li>
        <li>Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings, such as whipped cream, fresh berries, or a drizzle of maple syrup.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pancakes</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking can be tricky, but with a few tips, you can achieve pancakes that are just as fluffy and delicious as their gluten-containing counterparts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough pancakes. Stir until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the batter rest:</strong> Allowing the batter to rest for 5-10 minutes before cooking can help the flours hydrate and improve the texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the consistency:</strong> If the batter is too thick, add a splash of milk. If it’s too thin, add a bit more flour.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Gingerbread Pancakes</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these pancakes vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Simply replace the egg with a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) and use a non-dairy milk like almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of molasses?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have molasses, you can substitute it with an equal amount of honey or maple syrup. However, molasses adds a distinct gingerbread flavor, so the taste may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze these pancakes?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Let the pancakes cool completely, then place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze. Once frozen, transfer them to a zip-top bag. Reheat in the toaster or microwave for a quick breakfast.</p>

        <h3>Are these pancakes suitable for kids?</h3>
        <p>Yes, these pancakes are kid-friendly and a great way to introduce children to gluten-free baking. The spices are mild, and you can adjust the sweetness to their liking.</p>
    </div>
