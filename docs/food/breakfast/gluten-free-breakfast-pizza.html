    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Breakfast Pizza</h2>

    <p>Making a gluten-free breakfast pizza is easier than you might think. Follow these simple steps to create a delicious and nutritious breakfast:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crust</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 425°F (220°C). If you're using a store-bought gluten-free pizza crust, follow the package instructions for pre-baking. If you're making your own crust, roll out the dough on a parchment-lined baking sheet and pre-bake for about 5-7 minutes until it’s slightly firm.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Add the Toppings</h3>
    <p>Once the crust is pre-baked, it’s time to add your toppings. Start with a layer of cheese, followed by your choice of vegetables and meats. If you’re using eggs, crack them directly onto the pizza or scramble them first and spread them evenly over the crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Pizza</h3>
    <p>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. If you’ve added eggs, make sure they’re cooked to your desired level of doneness.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Garnish and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the pizza is out of the oven, let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh herbs, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, or a drizzle of hot sauce for an extra kick. Serve immediately and enjoy!</p>
