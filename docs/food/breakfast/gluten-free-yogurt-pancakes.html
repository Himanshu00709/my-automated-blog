    <h1>Gluten-Free Yogurt Pancakes: A Delicious and Healthy Breakfast Option</h1>

    <p>Breakfast is often referred to as the most important meal of the day, and for good reason. It sets the tone for your energy levels, metabolism, and overall well-being. If you're looking for a breakfast option that is both delicious and healthy, gluten-free yogurt pancakes are an excellent choice.

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
