    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Pancake Batter</h3>

    <p>Start by whisking together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense pancakes.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Cinnamon Sugar Filling</h3>

    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar and ground cinnamon. This mixture will be swirled into the pancakes to create the cinnamon roll effect. Set it aside for now.</p>

    <h3>3. Cook the Pancakes</h3>

    <p>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or cooking spray. Pour about ¼ cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Immediately sprinkle a generous amount of the cinnamon sugar mixture over the top of each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.</p>

    <h3>4. Prepare the Cream Cheese Glaze</h3>

    <p>While the pancakes are cooking, prepare the cream cheese glaze. In a small bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar and milk, mixing until you achieve a smooth, drizzle-able consistency. Adjust the amount of milk as needed to reach your desired consistency.</p>

    <h3>5. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once the pancakes are cooked, stack them on a plate and drizzle generously with the cream cheese glaze. Serve immediately and enjoy the delicious combination of flavors and textures that make these gluten-free cinnamon roll pancakes a true breakfast delight.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. However, keep in mind that different flours may affect the texture of the pancakes. For best results, use a blend that is specifically designed for baking.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these pancakes ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>While these pancakes are best enjoyed fresh, you can make them ahead of time and reheat them in the microwave or toaster. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.</p>

        <h3>Can I freeze these pancakes?</h3>
        <p>Yes, these pancakes freeze well. Allow them to cool completely, then place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze until solid. Transfer the frozen pancakes to a zip-top bag or airtight container and store in the freezer for up to 2 months. Reheat in the microwave or toaster when ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these pancakes vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these pancakes vegan by using a non-dairy milk, a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water), and a vegan butter substitute. For the glaze, use a vegan cream cheese alternative.</p>
