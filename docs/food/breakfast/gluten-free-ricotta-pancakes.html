    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to make your own gluten-free ricotta pancakes:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the ricotta cheese, eggs, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense pancakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Heat the Pan</h3>
    <p>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or oil. Allow the pan to heat up for a minute or two before adding the batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cook the Pancakes</h3>
    <p>Using a ladle or measuring cup, pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip the pancakes and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and serve immediately with your favorite toppings. Fresh berries, a drizzle of maple syrup, or a dollop of Greek yogurt are all excellent choices.</p>
