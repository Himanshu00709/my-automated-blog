<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Bread</h3>

<p>Start by cutting the gluten-free bread into cubes. You can use any type of gluten-free bread, but a denser bread like a gluten-free sourdough or whole-grain bread works best. Arrange the bread cubes in a greased 9x13 inch baking dish.</p>

<h3>2. Add the Blueberries</h3>

<p>Next, sprinkle the fresh blueberries evenly over the bread cubes. You can also use frozen blueberries if fresh ones are not available, but make sure to thaw and drain them first to avoid excess moisture in the casserole.</p>

<h3>3. Prepare the Custard</h3>

<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, ground cinnamon, and maple syrup until well combined. Pour the custard mixture evenly over the bread and blueberries, making sure all the bread cubes are soaked.</p>

<h3>4. Let It Sit</h3>

<p>Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap and let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or overnight if possible. This allows the bread to fully absorb the custard, resulting in a richer and more flavorful casserole.</p>

<h3>5. Bake the Casserole</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Remove the plastic wrap from the baking dish and dot the top of the casserole with small pieces of butter. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the custard is set.</p>

<h3>6. Serve and Enjoy</h3>

<p>Once the casserole is done baking, let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Dust with powdered sugar if desired, and serve with additional maple syrup or fresh blueberries on the side.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I make this casserole ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the casserole the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight. This allows the bread to fully absorb the custard, resulting in a richer flavor. Simply bake it in the morning when you're ready to serve.</p>

    <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries, but make sure to thaw and drain them first to avoid excess moisture in the casserole. Excess moisture can make the casserole soggy.</p>

    <h3>What can I use instead of gluten-free bread?</h3>
    <p>If you don't have gluten-free bread, you can use any type of gluten-free baked goods, such as gluten-free muffins or even gluten-free croissants. Just make sure to cut them into cubes before using.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this casserole dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can use a dairy-free milk alternative, such as almond milk or oat milk, and substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter.</p>
</div>
