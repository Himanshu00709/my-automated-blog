    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making a Gluten-Free Breakfast Burrito</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the process of making a gluten-free breakfast burrito:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Tortillas</h3>
    <p>Start by warming your gluten-free tortillas. You can do this by placing them in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 30 seconds on each side, or by wrapping them in a damp paper towel and microwaving them for 20-30 seconds. Warming the tortillas makes them more pliable and easier to roll.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cook the Eggs</h3>
    <p>In a non-stick skillet, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Crack the eggs into a bowl, whisk them lightly, and pour them into the skillet. Cook the eggs, stirring occasionally, until they are scrambled and fully cooked. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper to taste.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Burrito</h3>
    <p>Lay a warmed tortilla flat on a clean surface. Spread a layer of black beans in the center, followed by the scrambled eggs. Add slices of avocado, a handful of spinach, and a sprinkle of cheese if desired. Top with a spoonful of salsa for added flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Roll the Burrito</h3>
    <p>To roll the burrito, fold the sides of the tortilla inward over the filling. Then, starting from the bottom, roll the tortilla up tightly, ensuring that the filling is securely enclosed. Repeat the process with the second tortilla.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Your gluten-free breakfast burrito is now ready to be enjoyed! You can serve it immediately, or wrap it in foil for a portable breakfast option. Pair it with a side of fresh fruit or a smoothie for a complete meal.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Breakfast Burritos</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I make a gluten-free breakfast burrito ahead of time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can prepare gluten-free breakfast burritos in advance. Simply assemble the burritos, wrap them tightly in foil or plastic wrap, and store them in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. When you’re ready to eat, reheat the burrito in the microwave or oven until warmed through.</p>

        <h3>2. Are gluten-free tortillas healthy?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free tortillas can be a healthy option, especially if they are made with whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, or almond flour. However, it’s important to check the ingredient list for added sugars or preservatives. Opt for tortillas with minimal ingredients and no artificial additives.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I add meat to my gluten-free breakfast burrito?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can add cooked bacon, sausage, or turkey to your gluten-free breakfast burrito for extra protein. Just make sure that the meat is gluten-free and free from any added fillers or preservatives.</p>

        <h3>4. What are some other gluten-free breakfast options?</h3>
        <p>If you’re looking for more gluten-free breakfast ideas, consider options like gluten-free oatmeal, smoothie bowls, chia pudding, or a vegetable-packed omelet. The key is to focus on whole, unprocessed ingredients that are naturally gluten-free.</p>
