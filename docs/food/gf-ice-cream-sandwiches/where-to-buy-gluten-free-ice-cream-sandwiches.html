    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Ice Cream Sandwiches?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free ice cream sandwiches are a great option for anyone who needs to avoid gluten but still wants to enjoy a classic treat. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. By choosing gluten-free ice cream sandwiches, you can indulge in a delicious dessert without worrying about gluten-related health issues. Additionally, many gluten-free options are made with high-quality ingredients, making them a healthier choice overall.</p>

    <h3>2. Specialty Health Food Stores</h3>
    <p>Health food stores are another excellent place to find gluten-free ice cream sandwiches. Stores like Sprouts, Natural Grocers, and local co-ops often have a wide selection of gluten-free products. These stores are particularly good for finding niche brands that may not be available in larger grocery chains.</p>
