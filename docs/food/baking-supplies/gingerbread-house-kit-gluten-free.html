<h2>Tips for Building the Perfect Gluten-Free Gingerbread House</h2>

<p>Building a gingerbread house can be a fun but challenging activity. Here are some tips to help you create the perfect gluten-free gingerbread house:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Before you start, lay out all the pieces and plan how you want your house to look. This will help you avoid mistakes and ensure that everything fits together properly.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Royal Icing:</strong> Royal icing is the best choice for building gingerbread houses because it dries hard and holds the pieces together securely. Most kits include royal icing, but you can also make your own using powdered sugar and egg whites or a vegan alternative.</li>
    <li><strong>Be Patient:</strong> Allow the icing to dry completely before adding decorations. This will help prevent the house from collapsing.</li>
    <li><strong>Get Creative:</strong> Don’t be afraid to add your own personal touches. Use additional candies, sprinkles, or even edible glitter to make your house unique.</li>
