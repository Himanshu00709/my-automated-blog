<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Italian Appetizers?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle.

<h3>1. Bruschetta with Gluten-Free Bread</h3>

To make it gluten-free, simply substitute traditional bread with a gluten-free alternative. Look for gluten-free baguettes or bread that are specifically designed for toasting. The key to a great bruschetta is using ripe, juicy tomatoes and high-quality olive oil. You can also add a sprinkle of balsamic vinegar for an extra layer of flavor.</p>

<h3>2. Caprese Salad</h3>

This dish is naturally gluten-free and requires no special adaptations. The key to a perfect Caprese salad is using the freshest ingredients available. Look for heirloom tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella for an authentic Italian experience.</p>

<h3>3. Stuffed Mushrooms</h3>

<p>Stuffed mushrooms are a versatile and delicious gluten-free appetizer. You can fill them with a variety of ingredients, such as cheese, herbs, and gluten-free breadcrumbs. To make gluten-free breadcrumbs, simply pulse gluten-free bread in a food processor until you achieve the desired texture. Combine the breadcrumbs with grated Parmesan cheese, garlic, and parsley, then stuff the mixture into mushroom caps. Bake until the mushrooms are tender and the filling is golden brown.</p>

<h3>4. Antipasto Platter</h3>

Simply replace the traditional flour with a gluten-free alternative, such as almond flour or chickpea flour.
