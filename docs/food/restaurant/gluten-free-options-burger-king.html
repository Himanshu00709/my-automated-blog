    <h1>Gluten-Free Options at Burger King: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. Fast food restaurants, in particular, are notorious for their limited gluten-free options. However, Burger King has made strides in accommodating those who need to avoid gluten. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free options available at Burger King, how to order safely, and what to be cautious about when dining at this popular fast-food chain.</p>

    <p>Burger King offers a variety of menu items that are naturally gluten-free or can be modified to be gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that Burger King does not have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen, so cross-contamination is a risk. Always inform the staff of your dietary restrictions and ask about their preparation methods.</p>
