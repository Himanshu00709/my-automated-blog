    <h2>Step-by-Step Preparation</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Pasta</h3>
    <p>Start by boiling a large pot of salted water. Add the gluten-free pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Be careful not to overcook, as gluten-free pasta can become mushy. Once cooked, drain the pasta and rinse it under cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Pesto</h3>
    <p>In a food processor, combine the fresh basil leaves, pine nuts, garlic cloves, and a pinch of salt. Pulse until the ingredients are finely chopped. With the processor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until the mixture becomes smooth and creamy. If you’re using Parmesan cheese, add it now and pulse until well combined. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Salad</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked and cooled pasta with the pesto sauce. Toss until the pasta is evenly coated. Add the cherry tomatoes (halved) and fresh mozzarella balls. Gently mix everything together. If desired, you can also add other vegetables like cucumbers, bell peppers, or olives for extra crunch and flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Transfer the pasta salad to a serving dish and garnish with additional basil leaves or a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. This dish can be served immediately or chilled in the refrigerator for a couple of hours to allow the flavors to meld together. It’s perfect for picnics, potlucks, or as a refreshing summer meal.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Pesto Pasta Salad</h2>
    <p>This gluten-free pesto pasta salad is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. The basil in the pesto is rich in vitamins A, C, and K, as well as antioxidants that help combat inflammation. Pine nuts provide healthy fats and protein, while the olive oil is a great source of monounsaturated fats, which are beneficial for heart health. The cherry tomatoes add a dose of vitamin C and lycopene, and the mozzarella provides calcium and protein. Overall, this dish is a well-rounded meal that supports a healthy diet.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
