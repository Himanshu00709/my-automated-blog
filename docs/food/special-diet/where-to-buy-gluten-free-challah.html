<h1>Where to Buy Gluten-Free Challah: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Challah, the traditional Jewish bread, is a staple during Shabbat and other Jewish holidays. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying this delicious bread can be a challenge.

<h2>Why Gluten-Free Challah?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free challah is essential for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe health issues for these individuals. Symptoms range from digestive problems to more severe autoimmune reactions. Gluten-free challah allows those with dietary restrictions to participate in traditional Jewish rituals and enjoy the same flavors and textures as regular challah.</p>

            <td><strong>Ingredients</strong></td>
            <td>Check the ingredient list to ensure the challah is made with gluten-free flours like rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour. Avoid products that contain wheat, barley, or rye.</td>
