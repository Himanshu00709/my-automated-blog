    <h1>Gluten-Free Boudin: A Delicious and Inclusive Cajun Delight</h1>

    <p>Boudin, a traditional Cajun sausage, is a beloved dish in Louisiana cuisine. Known for its rich flavors and unique texture, boudin is typically made with pork, rice, and a blend of spices. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic dish can be a challenge due to the presence of gluten in many traditional recipes. Enter gluten-free boudin—a delicious and inclusive alternative that allows everyone to savor the flavors of Cajun cuisine without compromise.</p>

    <h2>What is Boudin?</h2>
