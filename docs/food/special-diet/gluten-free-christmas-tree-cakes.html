    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Christmas Tree Cakes</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making these festive cakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter (or coconut oil) and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, and baking powder. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Add a few drops of green food coloring until you achieve the desired shade of green.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Bake the Cakes</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into a Christmas tree-shaped cake mold or use a regular cake pan and cut out tree shapes after baking. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool completely before decorating.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Decorate the Cakes</h3>
    <p>Once the cakes are cool, it’s time to decorate! Use a simple glaze made from powdered sugar and milk, or get creative with frosting, sprinkles, and edible glitter. Add small candies or edible pearls as ornaments, and a star-shaped candy or fondant piece at the top of each tree for the finishing touch.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Christmas Tree Cakes</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these cakes dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make these cakes dairy-free by substituting the butter with coconut oil or a dairy-free margarine, and using a dairy-free milk alternative in the glaze or frosting.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What if I don’t have a Christmas tree-shaped mold?</h3>
        <p>No problem! You can bake the cake in a regular pan and use a cookie cutter to cut out tree shapes after baking. Alternatively, you can shape the cakes by hand before baking.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store these cakes?</h3>
        <p>Store the cakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. If you’ve used a frosting that requires refrigeration, store the cakes in the fridge and bring them to room temperature before serving.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free Christmas tree cakes are a wonderful way to celebrate the holiday season without compromising on taste or dietary needs. With the right ingredients and a little creativity, you can create a festive dessert that everyone will love. Whether you’re baking for a party or just want to enjoy a sweet treat at home, these cakes are sure to bring a smile to your face.
