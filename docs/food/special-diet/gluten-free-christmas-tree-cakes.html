    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Christmas Tree Cakes at Home</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free Christmas tree cakes at home is easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create a festive dessert that everyone will love:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine your gluten-free flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, and melted butter or oil. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until you have a smooth batter.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Bake the Cakes</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into a Christmas tree-shaped cake mold or use a regular cake pan and cut the cake into a tree shape after baking. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool completely before decorating.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Decorate Your Cakes</h3>
    <p>Once the cakes are cool, it’s time to decorate! Use green icing to cover the cakes, then add colorful sprinkles, edible glitter, or small candies to create a festive look. You can also use a piping bag to add details like ornaments or garlands to your Christmas trees.</p>
