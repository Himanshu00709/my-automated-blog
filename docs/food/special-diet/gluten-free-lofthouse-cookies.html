<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Lofthouse Cookies at Home</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free Lofthouse cookies at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create these delicious treats:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>

<p>Start by creaming together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and baking powder. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add a tablespoon of milk or non-dairy alternative.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Shape the Cookies</h3>

<p>Roll the dough into balls and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Flatten each ball slightly with the palm of your hand or the bottom of a glass. Make sure to leave enough space between each cookie to allow for spreading.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Bake the Cookies</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and bake the cookies for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake, as gluten-free cookies can dry out quickly. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Frost and Decorate</h3>

<p>Once the cookies are completely cool, it’s time to frost and decorate them. You can use a simple buttercream frosting made with powdered sugar, butter, vanilla extract, and a splash of milk. Add food coloring if desired, and spread the frosting over each cookie. Finish with a sprinkle of colorful sprinkles for that classic Lofthouse look.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Lofthouse Cookies</h2>

    <h3>How do I store gluten-free Lofthouse cookies?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free Lofthouse cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 2 months. Make sure to separate layers of cookies with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>
