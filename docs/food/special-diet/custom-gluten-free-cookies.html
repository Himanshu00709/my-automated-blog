        <li><strong>Allergen-Friendly:</strong> Custom cookies can be tailored to avoid other common allergens like nuts, dairy, or eggs, making them suitable for a wider audience.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> From flavors to shapes, custom cookies can be designed to match any occasion, preference, or dietary requirement.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Digestion:</strong> For those with gluten sensitivity, gluten-free cookies can help reduce bloating, gas, and other digestive issues.</li>
