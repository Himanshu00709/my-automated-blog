    <h2>Tips for Working with Gluten-Free Candy Melts</h2>

    <p>Working with candy melts can be a bit tricky, especially if you’re new to them. Here are some tips to help you get the best results:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Melt Slowly:</strong> Always melt candy melts slowly over low heat or in short bursts in the microwave. Overheating can cause them to seize or become lumpy.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Double Boiler:</strong> For even melting, consider using a double boiler. This method helps maintain a consistent temperature and prevents burning.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Oil for Smoothness:</strong> If your candy melts are too thick, you can add a small amount of vegetable oil or shortening to achieve a smoother consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Water:</strong> Water is the enemy of candy melts. Even a small amount can cause them to seize, so make sure all your tools and surfaces are completely dry.</li>
        <li><strong>Reheat as Needed:</strong> Candy melts can harden quickly, so don’t hesitate to reheat them if they start to thicken while you’re working.</li>
    </ul>
