    <h1>Gluten-Free Matza: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Matza, also known as matzah or matzo, is a staple during the Jewish holiday of Passover. Traditionally made from wheat flour and water, matza is unleavened bread that symbolizes the haste with which the Israelites fled Egypt, leaving no time for their bread to rise. However, for those with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or those who simply choose to avoid gluten, traditional matza is off the table. Enter gluten-free matza—a modern solution that allows everyone to partake in this ancient tradition. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free matza, from its history and preparation to its nutritional benefits and where to find it.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Matza?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free matza is a variation of traditional matza that is made without gluten-containing grains. Instead of wheat, gluten-free matza is typically made from alternative flours such as oat, rice, quinoa, or almond flour. These flours are combined with water and baked quickly to prevent any leavening, adhering to the strict Passover dietary laws. The result is a crisp, cracker-like bread that is safe for those who cannot consume gluten.</p>

    <h2>The History of Matza and Its Significance</h2>

    <p>Matza has been a central element of the Passover Seder for thousands of years. According to the Torah, the Israelites left Egypt in such a hurry that they did not have time to let their bread rise. As a result, they baked unleavened bread, which became known as matza. This bread is not only a symbol of the Exodus but also a reminder of the hardships endured by the Israelites during their enslavement.</p>

    <p>For those who observe Passover, eating matza is a commandment, and it is strictly forbidden to consume any leavened products (chametz) during the holiday. This includes bread, pasta, and any other food made from wheat, barley, rye, oats, or spelt that has been allowed to ferment and rise. Gluten-free matza provides an alternative for those who cannot consume these grains, ensuring that they can still fulfill the mitzvah (commandment) of eating matza during Passover.</p>

    <h2>How is Gluten-Free Matza Made?</h2>

    <p>The process of making gluten-free matza is similar to that of traditional matza, but with a few key differences. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>

                <td>3. Rolling and Pricking</td>
                <td>The dough is rolled out into thin sheets and pricked with a fork to prevent it from rising during baking.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4. Baking</td>
                <td>The dough is baked at a high temperature for a short period of time, typically around 18 minutes, to ensure that it remains unleavened.</td>
            </tr>
