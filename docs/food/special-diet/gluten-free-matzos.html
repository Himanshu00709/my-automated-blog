    <h1>Gluten-Free Matzos: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Matzos, the unleavened bread traditionally eaten during Passover, holds a significant place in Jewish culture and cuisine. However, for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, traditional matzos made from wheat are off the table. Enter gluten-free matzos—a modern solution that allows everyone to partake in this ancient tradition. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free matzos, from their ingredients and preparation to their nutritional benefits and where to find them.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten-Free Matzos?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free matzos are a variation of the traditional matzo, designed specifically for individuals who cannot consume gluten. Traditional matzos are made from wheat flour and water, which are mixed and baked quickly to prevent fermentation. Gluten-free matzos, on the other hand, are made from alternative flours such as rice, oat, or tapioca flour, ensuring they are safe for those with gluten-related disorders.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients and Preparation</h2>

    <p>The preparation of gluten-free matzos is similar to that of traditional matzos, but with a few key differences. The primary challenge is achieving the same texture and taste without using wheat flour. Here’s a breakdown of the typical ingredients and steps involved:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Ingredient</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Rice Flour</td>
                <td>Provides structure and a neutral flavor.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Tapioca Flour</td>
                <td>Adds elasticity and helps bind the dough.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Potato Starch</td>
                <td>Improves texture and moisture retention.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Water</td>
                <td>Hydrates the dough and activates the flours.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salt</td>
                <td>Enhances flavor.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The dough is mixed quickly to prevent fermentation, rolled out thinly, and then baked at a high temperature to achieve the characteristic crispness of matzos. The entire process must be completed within 18 minutes to comply with Passover dietary laws.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Matzos</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free matzos offer several nutritional benefits, especially for those with gluten intolerance. Here’s a comparison of the nutritional content between traditional and gluten-free matzos:</p>
