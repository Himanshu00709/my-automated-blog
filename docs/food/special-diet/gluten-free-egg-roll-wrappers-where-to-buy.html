    <h2>How to Use Gluten-Free Egg Roll Wrappers</h2>

    <p>Using gluten-free egg roll wrappers is similar to using traditional ones, but there are a few tips to ensure success:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep them moist:</strong> Gluten-free wrappers can dry out quickly, so keep them covered with a damp cloth while working.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overfill:</strong> Overfilling can cause the wrappers to tear. Use about 2-3 tablespoons of filling per wrapper.</li>
        <li><strong>Seal properly:</strong> Use a small amount of water or egg wash to seal the edges and prevent the filling from leaking during cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook gently:</strong> Gluten-free wrappers may be more delicate, so fry or bake them at a moderate temperature to avoid burning.</li>
    </ul>
