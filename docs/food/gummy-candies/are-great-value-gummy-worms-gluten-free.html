    <h1>Are Great Value Gummy Worms Gluten-Free? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Gummy worms are a popular treat enjoyed by people of all ages. Whether you're snacking on them during a movie night or using them as a fun addition to a party, gummy worms are a versatile and delicious candy. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, it's crucial to know whether these treats are safe to consume. In this article, we'll dive deep into whether Great Value Gummy Worms are gluten-free, explore their ingredients, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>What Does Gluten-Free Mean?</h2>

    <p>Before we delve into the specifics of Great Value Gummy Worms, it's essential to understand what "gluten-free" means. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. A gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment for these conditions.</p>

    <p>Foods labeled as "gluten-free" must meet strict regulatory standards. In the United States, the FDA requires that foods labeled as gluten-free contain less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. This threshold is considered safe for most people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>
