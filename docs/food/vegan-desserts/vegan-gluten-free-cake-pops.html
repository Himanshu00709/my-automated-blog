    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Cake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond milk and apple cider vinegar. Add the vegan butter, sugar, and vanilla extract to the wet mixture. Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until a smooth batter forms. Pour the batter into a greased cake pan and bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Crumble the Cake:</strong> Once the cake has cooled, crumble it into fine pieces using your hands or a food processor. Add the vegan frosting to the crumbled cake and mix until the mixture holds together when pressed.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Cake Pops:</strong> Roll the mixture into small, even balls (about 1-1.5 inches in diameter). Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to firm up.</li>
        <li><strong>Melt the Chocolate:</strong> In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the vegan chocolate or candy melts in 30-second intervals, stirring in between until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Cake Pops:</strong> Dip the tip of each lollipop stick into the melted chocolate and insert it into a cake ball. Once all the sticks are in place, dip each cake pop into the melted chocolate, ensuring it’s fully coated. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off before placing the cake pops back on the parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Decorate and Set:</strong> While the chocolate is still wet, you can add sprinkles, crushed nuts, or other decorations. Let the cake pops set completely at room temperature or in the refrigerator.</li>
    </ol>
