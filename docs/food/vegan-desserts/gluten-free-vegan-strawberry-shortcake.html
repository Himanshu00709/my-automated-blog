<h1>Gluten-Free Vegan Strawberry Shortcake: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Strawberries</h3>

<p>Start by washing and slicing the fresh strawberries. Place them in a bowl and set aside. If you prefer a sweeter filling, you can toss the strawberries with a tablespoon of maple syrup and let them macerate for about 15 minutes.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Shortcake</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted coconut oil, maple syrup, almond milk, apple cider vinegar, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix the batter.</p>

<h3>3. Bake the Shortcake</h3>

<p>Pour the batter into a greased 8-inch round cake pan. Smooth the top with a spatula and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the shortcake to cool completely before assembling the dessert.</p>

<h3>4. Assemble the Strawberry Shortcake</h3>

<p>Once the shortcake has cooled, slice it horizontally into two layers. Spread a layer of coconut whipped cream on the bottom layer, followed by a generous amount of sliced strawberries. Place the top layer of the shortcake over the strawberries and repeat the process with more whipped cream and strawberries. Serve immediately and enjoy!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flour blends, such as rice flour, oat flour, or a combination of flours. Just make sure to adjust the liquid ingredients as needed to achieve the right consistency.</p>

    <h3>Can I use frozen strawberries?</h3>
    <p>While fresh strawberries are preferred, you can use frozen strawberries if fresh ones are not available. Thaw and drain them before using to avoid excess moisture in the dessert.</p>

    <h3>How do I store leftover strawberry shortcake?</h3>
    <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. The shortcake may become slightly soggy over time, so it's best enjoyed fresh.</p>

    <h3>Can I make this dessert nut-free?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can substitute almond flour with a nut-free flour like sunflower seed flour or use an additional cup of gluten-free flour blend. Also, replace almond milk with a nut-free alternative like oat or soy milk.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free vegan strawberry shortcake is a delightful dessert that proves you don't need traditional ingredients to create something truly special. With a few simple substitutions and a bit of creativity, you can enjoy a treat that's both delicious and inclusive. Whether you're hosting a summer gathering or simply craving a sweet indulgence, this recipe is sure to impress. So, gather your ingredients, preheat your oven, and get ready to enjoy a slice of gluten-free vegan strawberry shortcake that everyone can savor!</p>
