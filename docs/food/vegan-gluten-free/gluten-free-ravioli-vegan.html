    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Vegan Ravioli</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free vegan ravioli at home may seem daunting, but with the right ingredients and techniques, it can be a rewarding experience. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by mixing your gluten-free flour with xanthan gum or psyllium husk in a large bowl. Gradually add water or plant-based milk and olive oil, kneading until a smooth dough forms. Let the dough rest for about 30 minutes to allow the flours to hydrate fully.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is resting, prepare your filling. For a classic vegan ravioli, you can blend tofu with nutritional yeast, garlic, and herbs to create a cheesy filling. Alternatively, you can use mashed butternut squash or sautéed spinach for a more vegetable-forward option.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Roll Out the Dough</h3>
    <p>After the dough has rested, roll it out thinly using a rolling pin or pasta machine. Cut the dough into squares or circles, depending on your preference.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Ravioli</h3>
    <p>Place a small amount of filling in the center of each dough piece. Fold the dough over the filling, pressing the edges to seal. You can use a fork to crimp the edges for a decorative touch.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cook the Ravioli</h3>
    <p>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and gently drop the ravioli in. Cook for about 3-5 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Serve with your favorite vegan sauce, such as marinara or pesto.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Vegan Ravioli</h2>
