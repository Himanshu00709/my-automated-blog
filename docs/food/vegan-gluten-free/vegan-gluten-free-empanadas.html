    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by combining your gluten-free flour blend with xanthan gum in a large mixing bowl. Add cold coconut oil or vegan butter, and use your fingers to work it into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add plant-based milk, mixing until a dough forms. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Filling</h3>
    <p>While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. Sauté diced onions, bell peppers, and garlic in a pan with a bit of olive oil until softened. Add cooked black beans or lentils, along with your choice of spices. Cook until the flavors meld together, then set aside to cool.</p>

    <h3>3. Assemble the Empanadas</h3>
    <p>Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut it into circles using a round cutter or a bowl. Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each circle, fold the dough over to form a half-moon shape, and seal the edges by pressing with a fork. Brush the empanadas with a bit of plant-based milk to help them brown in the oven.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the empanadas on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown. Let them cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits</h2>
    <p>Vegan gluten-free empanadas are not only delicious but also highly nutritious. The combination of gluten-free flours and plant-based ingredients provides a good source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Black beans and lentils are rich in protein and iron, making these empanadas a great option for those looking to boost their protein intake without relying on animal products. Additionally, the use of fresh vegetables ensures that you’re getting a variety of essential nutrients in every bite.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I freeze vegan gluten-free empanadas?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze these empanadas either before or after baking. If freezing before baking, assemble the empanadas and place them on a baking sheet in the freezer until solid. Once frozen, transfer them to a freezer-safe bag. When ready to bake, simply place them in the oven and add a few extra minutes to the baking time. If freezing after baking, let them cool completely before storing in a freezer-safe container. Reheat in the oven for best results.</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>What can I use instead of xanthan gum?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have xanthan gum, you can use guar gum or psyllium husk as a substitute. Both work well as binders in gluten-free baking. However, keep in mind that the texture of the dough may vary slightly depending on the substitute you choose.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these empanadas oil-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make oil-free empanadas by substituting the coconut oil or vegan butter in the dough with applesauce or mashed bananas. For the filling, you can sauté the vegetables in vegetable broth instead of oil. Keep in mind that the texture and flavor may be slightly different, but the empanadas will still be delicious.</p>
    </div>
