    <h1>Gluten-Free Gum Brands: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding gluten-free products is essential for maintaining health and well-being. While many people focus on gluten-free foods, it's equally important to consider other products, such as chewing gum. Surprisingly, not all gum brands are gluten-free, and some may contain hidden gluten ingredients. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free gum brands, providing you with a detailed guide to help you make informed choices.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Gum Matters</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, even trace amounts of gluten can trigger adverse reactions, including digestive issues, fatigue, and skin problems. Chewing gum is often overlooked as a potential source of gluten, but some brands use gluten-containing ingredients in their formulations. Therefore, it's crucial to choose gum that is certified gluten-free to avoid any health risks.</p>
