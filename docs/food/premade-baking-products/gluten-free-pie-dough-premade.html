</ul>

            <td>Ingredients</td>
            <td>Check the ingredient list for any allergens or additives you want to avoid. Look for dough made with high-quality, whole-food ingredients.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Texture</td>
            <td>Consider the texture you want for your crust. Some doughs are flakier, while others are more tender or crumbly.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Flavor</td>
            <td>Choose a dough with a flavor profile that complements your pie filling. Some doughs have a neutral taste, while others may have a nutty or buttery flavor.</td>

<h2>Tips for Working with Premade Gluten-Free Pie Dough</h2>

<p>Working with gluten-free pie dough can be different from working with traditional dough. Here are some tips to help you achieve the best results:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Thaw Properly:</strong> If your dough is frozen, allow it to thaw in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight. Avoid thawing at room temperature, as this can make the dough too soft and difficult to handle.</li>
    <li><strong>Roll Carefully:</strong> Gluten-free dough can be more fragile than traditional dough. Roll it out between two sheets of parchment paper to prevent sticking and tearing.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill Before Baking:</strong> After shaping your crust, chill it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before baking. This helps the dough hold its shape and prevents shrinkage.</li>
    <li><strong>Blind Bake if Necessary:</strong> For pies with wet fillings, consider blind baking (pre-baking) the crust to prevent it from becoming soggy.</li>
</ul>
