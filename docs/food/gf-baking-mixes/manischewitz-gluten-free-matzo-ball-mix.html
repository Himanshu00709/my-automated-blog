    <p>Preparing the Manischewitz Gluten-Free Matzo Ball Mix is straightforward and requires only a few additional ingredients. Here’s a step-by-step guide to making perfect gluten-free matzo balls:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Gather Your Ingredients:</strong> You’ll need the matzo ball mix, eggs, and oil or melted margarine.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Ingredients:</strong> In a bowl, combine the matzo ball mix with eggs and oil. Stir until the mixture is well combined and forms a dough-like consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Refrigerate the Dough:</strong> Cover the bowl and refrigerate the dough for at least 15 minutes. This step is crucial as it allows the dough to firm up, making it easier to shape into balls.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Matzo Balls:</strong> Once the dough has chilled, wet your hands and shape the dough into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Matzo Balls:</strong> Bring a pot of salted water or chicken broth to a boil. Gently drop the matzo balls into the boiling liquid, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cover the pot. Cook for about 20-25 minutes, or until the matzo balls are cooked through and float to the surface.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Once cooked, the matzo balls can be served in your favorite chicken soup or enjoyed on their own. The result is a light, fluffy, and delicious gluten-free version of the classic matzo ball.</p>
