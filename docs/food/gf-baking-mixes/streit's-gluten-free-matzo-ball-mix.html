    <ol>

        <li><strong>Cook the Matzo Balls:</strong> Bring a pot of salted water or chicken broth to a boil. Gently drop the matzo balls into the boiling liquid, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover the pot and let the matzo balls cook for about 20-25 minutes, or until they are light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove the matzo balls from the pot and serve them in your favorite soup or as a side dish.</li>
