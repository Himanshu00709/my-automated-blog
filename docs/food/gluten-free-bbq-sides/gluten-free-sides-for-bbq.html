    <h1>Gluten-Free Sides for BBQ: A Complete Guide</h1>
    <p>Barbecues are a staple of summer gatherings, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding the right sides can be a challenge. Gluten-free diets require careful attention to ingredients, but that doesn’t mean you have to miss out on delicious BBQ sides. In this guide, we’ll explore a variety of gluten-free side dishes that are sure to impress your guests and complement your grilled favorites.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Sides Matter</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause serious health issues for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Even a small amount of gluten can trigger symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. For this reason, it’s crucial to ensure that all dishes at a BBQ are gluten-free if you’re hosting someone with these conditions. Fortunately, there are plenty of naturally gluten-free ingredients and recipes that can make your BBQ both safe and delicious.</p>

    <h2>Top Gluten-Free BBQ Sides</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the best gluten-free sides that are perfect for any BBQ:</p>

    <h3>1. Grilled Vegetables</h3>
    <p>Grilled vegetables are a simple yet flavorful addition to any BBQ. Zucchini, bell peppers, eggplant, and asparagus are all excellent choices. Simply toss them in olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and grill until tender. You can also add a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese or a drizzle of balsamic glaze for extra flavor.</p>

    <h3>2. Quinoa Salad</h3>
    <p>Quinoa is a gluten-free grain that’s packed with protein and fiber. A quinoa salad with fresh vegetables, herbs, and a tangy vinaigrette is a refreshing side dish that pairs well with grilled meats. Add ingredients like cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, and avocado for a colorful and nutritious dish.</p>

    <h3>3. Corn on the Cob</h3>
    <p>Corn on the cob is a classic BBQ side that’s naturally gluten-free. Boil or grill the corn and serve it with butter, salt, and pepper. For a twist, try adding a sprinkle of chili powder or a squeeze of lime juice.</p>

    <h3>4. Coleslaw</h3>
    <p>Coleslaw is a crunchy, creamy side that’s easy to make gluten-free. Use a mayonnaise-based dressing and ensure that all ingredients, including the vinegar and mustard, are gluten-free. Add shredded cabbage, carrots, and a touch of honey for sweetness.</p>

    <h3>5. Sweet Potato Fries</h3>
    <p>Sweet potato fries are a healthier alternative to traditional fries and are naturally gluten-free. Slice sweet potatoes into thin strips, toss them in olive oil, and bake until crispy. Serve with a gluten-free dipping sauce like aioli or ketchup.</p>
