    <ol>

        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the applesauce, eggs, honey or maple syrup, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour into Pan:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free applesauce bread turns out perfectly every time:</p>

        <li>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze it for longer storage.</li>
