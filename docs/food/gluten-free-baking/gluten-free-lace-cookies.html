    <h1>Gluten-Free Lace Cookies: A Delicate and Delicious Treat</h1>
    <p>Gluten-free lace cookies are a delightful combination of crispiness, sweetness, and elegance. These delicate cookies, often characterized by their thin, lacy appearance, are a perfect treat for those who follow a gluten-free diet. Whether you're a seasoned baker or a novice in the kitchen, gluten-free lace cookies are surprisingly easy to make and are sure to impress your friends and family. In this article, we'll explore the history of lace cookies, their unique texture, and provide a step-by-step guide to making your own gluten-free version at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Lace Cookies</h2>
    <p>Lace cookies, also known as Florentine cookies, have a rich history that dates back to the Renaissance period in Italy. These cookies were originally made with almonds, sugar, and honey, and were often served as a luxurious treat for nobility. Over time, the recipe evolved, and variations of lace cookies began to appear in different parts of Europe. Today, lace cookies are enjoyed worldwide, and their gluten-free versions have become increasingly popular among those with dietary restrictions.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Lace Cookies Unique?</h2>
    <p>Lace cookies are known for their thin, delicate texture and intricate, lacy patterns. The key to achieving this unique texture lies in the combination of ingredients and the baking process. Unlike traditional cookies, lace cookies are made with a high ratio of butter and sugar, which causes them to spread out thinly during baking. The result is a cookie that is crisp, light, and almost translucent. When made gluten-free, these cookies maintain their signature texture while being safe for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Lace Cookies</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free lace cookies is a straightforward process that requires minimal effort. Follow these steps to create your own batch of these delicate treats:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and make cleanup easier.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, combine the melted butter, granulated sugar, and light corn syrup. Stir until the mixture is smooth and well combined. Add the almond flour, vanilla extract, and salt, and mix until all the ingredients are fully incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Form the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a teaspoon, drop small amounts of the dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them at least 2 inches apart. The dough will spread out during baking, so it's important to leave enough space between each cookie.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are bubbly. Keep a close eye on the cookies, as they can burn quickly due to their thinness.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, the cookies will become crisp and delicate. Serve them as is or with a drizzle of chocolate for an extra touch of indulgence.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Lace Cookies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours such as coconut flour or oat flour. However, keep in mind that the texture of the cookies may vary depending on the type of flour used.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store gluten-free lace cookies?</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
