    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free jalapeño cornbread:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Set your oven to 375°F (190°C) and grease a 9-inch baking pan or cast-iron skillet.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free cornmeal, gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir until well mixed.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, honey (or sugar), and melted butter.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Add jalapeños and cheese:</strong> Fold in the chopped jalapeños and shredded cheese (if using) into the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the cornbread to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy warm with butter or your favorite spread.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Jalapeño Cornbread</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free jalapeño cornbread turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use fresh jalapeños:</strong> Fresh jalapeños provide the best flavor and heat. If you prefer a milder cornbread, remove the seeds and membranes before chopping.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense and tough cornbread. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking the cornbread at the 20-minute mark. The top should be golden brown, and a toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with add-ins:</strong> Feel free to customize your cornbread by adding ingredients like corn kernels, green onions, or even bacon for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>
