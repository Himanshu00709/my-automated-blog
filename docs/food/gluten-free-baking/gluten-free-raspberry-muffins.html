    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free raspberry muffins:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that these ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in your batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream together the unsalted butter (or coconut oil) and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving the right texture in your muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Make sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the buttermilk (or dairy-free alternative). Mix until just combined; overmixing can lead to dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Raspberries:</strong> Gently fold in the fresh raspberries. Be careful not to crush them too much, as you want to maintain their shape and texture in the muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill Muffin Tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full. This allows room for the muffins to rise without overflowing.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The tops should be golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Raspberry Muffins</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free raspberry muffins turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Raspberries:</strong> Fresh raspberries provide the best flavor and texture. If you must use frozen raspberries, do not thaw them before adding to the batter to prevent excess moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a high-quality gluten-free flour blend that is specifically designed for baking. Some blends include xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to tough muffins. Mix until the ingredients are just combined to ensure a tender crumb.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking your muffins a few minutes before the recommended baking time. A toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean or with a few crumbs attached.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen raspberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen raspberries, but do not thaw them before adding to the batter. This helps prevent the muffins from becoming too moist.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the unsalted butter with coconut oil and use a dairy-free milk alternative like almond milk or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute raspberries with other berries like blueberries, blackberries, or even diced strawberries. Just make sure to adjust the quantity as needed.</p>
