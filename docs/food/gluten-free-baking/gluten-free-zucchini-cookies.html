    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Zucchini</h3>
    <p>Start by grating the zucchini using a box grater. Once grated, place the zucchini in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much moisture as possible. This step is crucial to prevent the cookies from becoming too wet.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the unsalted butter (or coconut oil) with the granulated sugar and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix the dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Zucchini and Optional Mix-Ins</h3>
    <p>Fold in the grated zucchini and any optional mix-ins like chocolate chips or nuts. The dough should be thick but moist.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Drop spoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Zucchini Cookies</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free zucchini cookies are not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Zucchini is a low-calorie vegetable that’s rich in vitamins and minerals, including vitamin A, which supports eye health, and vitamin C, which boosts the immune system. Additionally, zucchini is a good source of dietary fiber, which aids in digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut. By using gluten-free flour, these cookies are suitable for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, making them a versatile and inclusive treat.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Zucchini Cookies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, almond flour can be used as a substitute for gluten-free flour. However, keep in mind that almond flour has a different texture and may require adjustments to the recipe, such as adding more moisture or a binding agent like xanthan gum.</p>

        <h3>How should I store gluten-free zucchini cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 2 months. Simply thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these cookies vegan by substituting the egg with a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) and using coconut oil instead of butter.</p>

        <h3>Are these cookies suitable for diabetics?</h3>
        <p>While these cookies are healthier than traditional cookies, they still contain sugar. If you’re managing diabetes, consider using a sugar substitute like stevia or erythritol to reduce the sugar content.</p>
