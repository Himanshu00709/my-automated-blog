    <h1>ANZAC Cookies Gluten-Free: A Delicious Twist on a Classic</h1>
    <p>ANZAC cookies, a beloved treat with deep historical roots, have been a staple in Australian and New Zealand households for over a century. Traditionally made with rolled oats, flour, sugar, coconut, butter, and golden syrup, these cookies are known for their chewy texture and rich, caramel-like flavor. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying these classic cookies can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free ANZAC cookies—a delicious twist on the traditional recipe that allows everyone to enjoy this iconic treat.</p>

    <h2>The History of ANZAC Cookies</h2>
    <p>ANZAC cookies have a rich history that dates back to World War I. The name "ANZAC" stands for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, and these cookies were originally sent to soldiers abroad because they could withstand the long journey without spoiling. Made with simple, shelf-stable ingredients, ANZAC cookies became a symbol of home and comfort for troops far from their families. Today, they are enjoyed not only for their historical significance but also for their delightful taste and texture.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular in recent years, not only for those with celiac disease but also for individuals with gluten sensitivity or those looking to reduce their gluten intake. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and other health problems for some people. By adapting the traditional ANZAC cookie recipe to be gluten-free, we can ensure that everyone can enjoy this classic treat without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free ANZAC Cookie Recipe</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free ANZAC cookies is easier than you might think. The key is to substitute the traditional wheat flour with a gluten-free alternative, such as almond flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 160°C (320°F) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free rolled oats, gluten-free flour, desiccated coconut, and brown sugar.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, melt the butter and golden syrup over low heat. Once melted, remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Dissolve the baking soda in the boiling water, then add it to the melted butter and syrup mixture. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Roll the mixture into small balls and place them on the prepared baking tray, leaving space between each cookie.</li>
        <li>Flatten each ball slightly with the back of a spoon or your fingers.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the tray for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free ANZAC Cookies</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free ANZAC cookies turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use certified gluten-free oats:</strong> While oats are naturally gluten-free, they can be contaminated with gluten during processing. Look for oats that are certified gluten-free to avoid any issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose the right flour:</strong> Almond flour adds a nutty flavor and a slightly denser texture, while a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend will give you a result closer to the traditional cookie. Experiment to find your preferred option.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch the baking time:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can brown quickly, so keep an eye on them to prevent over-baking.</li>
    </ul>
