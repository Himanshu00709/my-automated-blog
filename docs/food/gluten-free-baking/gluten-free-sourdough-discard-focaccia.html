    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>

    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, sourdough discard, warm water, olive oil, and salt. If using yeast, activate it in warm water before adding it to the mixture. Mix until a sticky dough forms. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</p>

    <h3>2. First Rise</h3>

    <p>After resting, stretch and fold the dough a few times to develop structure. Cover the bowl again and let it rise at room temperature for 4-6 hours, or until it doubles in size. If you’re short on time, you can place the dough in a warm spot to speed up the process.</p>

    <h3>3. Shape the Focaccia</h3>

    <p>Once the dough has risen, transfer it to a parchment-lined baking sheet or a well-oiled cast-iron skillet. Gently stretch the dough into a rectangle or circle, about 1 inch thick. Use your fingers to create dimples across the surface.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Toppings</h3>

    <p>Drizzle olive oil generously over the dough. Sprinkle your favorite toppings, such as fresh rosemary, olives, or cherry tomatoes. Press the toppings lightly into the dough.</p>

    <h3>5. Second Rise</h3>

    <p>Let the shaped focaccia rest for another 30-60 minutes. This allows the dough to relax and rise slightly before baking.</p>

    <h3>6. Bake to Perfection</h3>

    <p>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Bake the focaccia for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy on the edges. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before slicing.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Good Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that’s designed for baking bread.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Resting Time:</strong> Gluten-free dough needs time to hydrate and develop structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Toppings:</strong> Focaccia is versatile—try different herbs, cheeses, or even caramelized onions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this recipe without sourdough discard?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can omit the sourdough discard and increase the amount of gluten-free flour and water. However, the discard adds a unique flavor and texture, so it’s worth trying if you have it on hand.</p>

        <h3>How do I store leftover focaccia?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover focaccia in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly and freeze for up to 1 month.</p>

        <h3>Can I use a different type of oil?</h3>
        <p>While olive oil is traditional, you can use other oils like avocado or coconut oil. Keep in mind that this may alter the flavor slightly.</p>
    </div>
