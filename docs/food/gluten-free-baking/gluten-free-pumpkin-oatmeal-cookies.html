    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create your gluten-free pumpkin oatmeal cookies:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and make cleanup a breeze.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the pumpkin puree, brown sugar, granulated sugar, melted coconut oil, egg, and vanilla extract. Whisk these ingredients together until they are well combined and smooth.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix the gluten-free rolled oats, gluten-free flour blend, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until a thick dough forms. If you're using raisins or chocolate chips, fold them into the dough at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Scoop and Shape the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Space the cookies about 2 inches apart to allow for spreading. Gently flatten each cookie with the back of a spoon or your fingers to ensure even baking.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are golden brown. The centers may still be slightly soft, but they will firm up as the cookies cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your gluten-free pumpkin oatmeal cookies with a glass of milk or a cup of tea!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pumpkin Oatmeal Cookies</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular oats instead of gluten-free oats?</h3>
        <p>While regular oats are naturally gluten-free, they are often processed in facilities that also handle wheat, barley, and rye, which can lead to cross-contamination. If you have celiac disease or a severe gluten sensitivity, it's best to use certified gluten-free oats to ensure your cookies are safe to eat.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I substitute the pumpkin puree with something else?</h3>
        <p>Pumpkin puree adds moisture and flavor to these cookies, but if you don't have any on hand, you can try using mashed banana or applesauce as a substitute. Keep in mind that this will alter the flavor profile of the cookies.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store your gluten-free pumpkin oatmeal cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 3 months. Simply thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these cookies vegan by substituting the egg with a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) and using a plant-based sweetener like maple syrup instead of granulated sugar. Ensure that your chocolate chips or raisins are also vegan-friendly.</p>
