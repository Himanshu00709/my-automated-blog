<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Follow these simple steps to create your banana chocolate chip gluten-free muffins:</p>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly to prevent sticking.</p>

<h3>2. Mash the Bananas</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more flavorful your muffins will be.</p>

<h3>3. Mix Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>Add the melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract to the mashed bananas. Mix well until all the ingredients are fully combined.</p>

<h3>4. Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that the dry ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

<h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</p>

<h3>6. Add Chocolate Chips</h3>
<p>Fold in the chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</p>

<h3>7. Fill the Muffin Tin</h3>
<p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full. This allows room for the muffins to rise while baking.</p>

<h3>8. Bake</h3>
<p>Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</p>

<h3>9. Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>
