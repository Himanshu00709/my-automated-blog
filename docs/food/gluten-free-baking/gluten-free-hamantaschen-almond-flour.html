<h1>Gluten-Free Hamantaschen with Almond Flour: A Delicious Twist on a Classic Treat</h1>

<p>Hamantaschen, the iconic triangular cookies traditionally enjoyed during the Jewish holiday of Purim, are a beloved treat for many. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying these delightful pastries can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free hamantaschen made with almond flour! This recipe not only caters to those with gluten sensitivities but also adds a rich, nutty flavor that elevates the classic cookie to a whole new level. In this blog post, we’ll explore the benefits of using almond flour, provide a step-by-step recipe, and answer some frequently asked questions about gluten-free baking.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Almond Flour for Gluten-Free Hamantaschen?</h2>

<p>Almond flour is a fantastic alternative to traditional wheat flour for several reasons. First and foremost, it’s naturally gluten-free, making it an excellent choice for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Additionally, almond flour is rich in healthy fats, protein, and fiber, which can help stabilize blood sugar levels and keep you feeling full longer. Its fine texture and slightly sweet, nutty flavor make it an ideal base for cookies and pastries, including hamantaschen.</p>

<p>Another advantage of using almond flour is its moisture content. Unlike some gluten-free flours that can result in dry, crumbly baked goods, almond flour helps retain moisture, ensuring that your hamantaschen are tender and delicious. Plus, it’s incredibly versatile and can be used in a variety of recipes, from cakes to breads to cookies.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, tapioca flour, sugar, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution of ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. The dough should be slightly sticky but manageable.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Chilling the dough will make it easier to roll out and shape.</li>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> While the dough is chilling, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Once the dough has chilled, roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use tapioca flour for dusting) to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use a round cookie cutter or glass to cut out circles of dough.</li>
    <li><strong>Fill and Shape:</strong> Place a small amount of your chosen filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold the edges of the dough up to form a triangle, pinching the corners to seal. Make sure to leave a small opening in the center to expose the filling.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Arrange the shaped hamantaschen on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
</ol>
