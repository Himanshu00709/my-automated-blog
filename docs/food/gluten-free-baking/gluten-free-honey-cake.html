    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Honey Cake</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create a delicious gluten-free honey cake that will impress your family and friends:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and baking soda. Whisk together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, honey, vanilla extract, olive oil, and almond milk. Mix until the ingredients are well incorporated.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add Optional Ingredients</h3>
    <p>If you're using any optional add-ins like nuts or dried fruits, fold them into the batter at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and serve. Enjoy your gluten-free honey cake with a cup of tea or coffee!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Honey Cake</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours such as oat flour, buckwheat flour, or coconut flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor of the cake may vary depending on the flour you choose.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this cake vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! To make a vegan version of this cake, replace the eggs with flax eggs or chia eggs, and use a plant-based milk like almond or oat milk. Ensure that your honey is vegan-friendly or substitute it with maple syrup or agave nectar.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the gluten-free honey cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months. Thaw the cake at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>Can I add frosting to the cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add frosting if you like. A simple glaze made with powdered sugar and lemon juice or a cream cheese frosting would complement the flavors of the honey cake beautifully.</p>
