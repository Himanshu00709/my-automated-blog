    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free lemon poppy seed muffins:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven</strong> to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients</strong>: In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and poppy seeds.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the wet ingredients</strong>: In another bowl, mix the melted butter (or coconut oil), sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, lemon zest, lemon juice, and yogurt until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients</strong>: Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the muffin tin</strong>: Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong>: Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool</strong>: Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Muffins</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free lemon poppy seed muffins turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend</strong>: Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of flours like rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter</strong>: Overmixing can lead to dense muffins. Mix until just combined to keep them light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add extra lemon flavor</strong>: If you love a strong lemon flavor, consider adding a bit more lemon zest or a few drops of lemon extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly</strong>: These muffins can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the refrigerator for up to a week. They also freeze well for up to 3 months.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use almond flour, but keep in mind that it will change the texture of the muffins. Almond flour tends to make baked goods denser and moister, so you may need to adjust the baking time accordingly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these muffins dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with coconut oil and use a dairy-free yogurt alternative. Just make sure all your ingredients are dairy-free to keep the recipe suitable for those with dairy intolerances.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How can I make these muffins sweeter?</h3>
        <p>If you prefer a sweeter muffin, you can increase the sugar to 1 cup or add a glaze made from powdered sugar and lemon juice after the muffins have cooled.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free lemon poppy seed muffins are a delightful treat that combines the bright, zesty flavor of lemon with the subtle crunch of poppy seeds. With the right ingredients and a few simple steps, you can create muffins that are not only gluten-free but also incredibly delicious. Whether you're baking for yourself or for a crowd, these muffins are sure to be a hit.
