    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your own gluten-free raspberry scones:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut in the Butter:</strong> Add the cold butter to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, egg, and vanilla extract. Pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Raspberries:</strong> Gently fold in the fresh raspberries, being careful not to crush them too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a circle about 1 inch thick. Cut the circle into 8 wedges.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the wedges on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until the scones are golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the scones to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy them warm with a cup of tea or coffee!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Scones</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free scones can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for creating flaky layers in your scones. Make sure your butter is straight from the fridge.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough scones. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Handle Raspberries Gently:</strong> Raspberries are delicate, so fold them into the dough gently to avoid crushing them.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the Dough Rest:</strong> Allowing the dough to rest for a few minutes before baking can help the scones rise better.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen raspberries instead of fresh?</h3>

        <p>Store the scones in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>
