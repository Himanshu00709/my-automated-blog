    <h1>Gluten-Free Anzac Cookies: A Delicious Twist on a Classic</h1>
    <p>Anzac cookies are a beloved treat with a rich history, originating from Australia and New Zealand. Traditionally made with rolled oats, flour, sugar, coconut, butter, and golden syrup, these cookies are known for their chewy texture and sweet, caramel-like flavor. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying these classic cookies can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free Anzac cookies—a delicious twist on the traditional recipe that allows everyone to enjoy this iconic treat.</p>

    <h2>The History of Anzac Cookies</h2>
    <p>Anzac cookies have a storied past, dating back to World War I. They were originally made by wives and women's groups to send to soldiers abroad, as the ingredients did not spoil easily and could withstand the long journey. The name "Anzac" stands for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, and the cookies became a symbol of national pride and resilience. Today, they are enjoyed not only for their historical significance but also for their delightful taste and texture.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular in recent years, not only for those with celiac disease but also for individuals with gluten sensitivities or those looking to reduce inflammation and improve digestion. Traditional Anzac cookies contain wheat flour, which is a source of gluten. By substituting gluten-free flour and ensuring that all other ingredients are gluten-free, you can create a version of these cookies that is safe for everyone to enjoy.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Anzac Cookie Recipe</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free Anzac cookies is surprisingly simple. The key is to use gluten-free rolled oats and a high-quality gluten-free flour blend. Here’s a step-by-step recipe to help you create these delicious treats:</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free rolled oats, gluten-free flour, desiccated coconut, and brown sugar.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, melt the butter and golden syrup over low heat. Once melted, remove from heat and stir in the baking soda and boiling water. The mixture will foam slightly.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Roll tablespoon-sized portions of the dough into balls and place them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each cookie.</li>
        <li>Flatten each ball slightly with the back of a spoon or your fingers.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Anzac Cookies</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free Anzac cookies turn out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use certified gluten-free oats:</strong> While oats are naturally gluten-free, they can be contaminated during processing. Look for oats that are certified gluten-free to avoid any issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose the right flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. A blend that includes rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch works well for this recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch the baking time:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can brown quickly, so keep an eye on them to prevent burning.</li>
    </ul>
