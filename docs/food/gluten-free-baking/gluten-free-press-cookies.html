    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to make your own gluten-free press cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line your baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the egg and vanilla:</strong> Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix in the dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the gluten-free flour blend and salt to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the cookie press:</strong> Fill your cookie press with the dough and choose your desired disk shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Press the cookies:</strong> Press the cookies onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 1 inch apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Press Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free press cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use room temperature ingredients:</strong> Make sure your butter and egg are at room temperature before you start. This will help the ingredients blend more easily and create a smoother dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix the dough just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Add different extracts, such as almond or lemon, to change up the flavor of your cookies. You can also mix in gluten-free chocolate chips or dried fruit for added texture and taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough if necessary:</strong> If your dough is too soft to press, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before using the cookie press.</li>
