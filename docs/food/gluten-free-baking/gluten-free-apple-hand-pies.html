<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Gluten-Free Pie Crust</h3>

<p>Start by making the gluten-free pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum (if needed), granulated sugar, and salt. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Apple Filling</h3>

<p>While the dough is chilling, prepare the apple filling. In a medium saucepan, combine the diced apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the apples are tender and the mixture has thickened slightly. Remove from heat and let it cool completely.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble the Hand Pies</h3>

<p>Once the dough has chilled, roll it out on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Use a round cutter or a glass to cut out circles of dough. Place a spoonful of the cooled apple filling in the center of each circle. Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, then crimp the edges with a fork to seal. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.</p>

<h3>4. Bake the Hand Pies</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the assembled hand pies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Beat the egg and brush it over the tops of the hand pies for a golden finish. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Allow the hand pies to cool slightly before serving.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Apple Hand Pies</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of fruit for the filling?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! While apples are a classic choice, you can experiment with other fruits like peaches, berries, or even pears. Just adjust the sugar and spices accordingly to complement the fruit you choose.</p>

    <h3>How do I store gluten-free apple hand pies?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free apple hand pies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two days. For longer storage, keep them in the refrigerator for up to a week, or freeze them for up to three months. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I make the dough ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the gluten-free pie dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to two days, or freeze it for up to a month. Just make sure to let it thaw in the refrigerator before rolling it out.</p>

    <h3>What’s the best gluten-free flour blend to use?</h3>
    <p>There are many gluten-free flour blends available, but for the best results, choose one that is specifically designed for baking. Some popular brands include Bob’s Red Mill, King Arthur Flour, and Cup4Cup. These blends typically include a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch, which work well for pie crusts.</p>
