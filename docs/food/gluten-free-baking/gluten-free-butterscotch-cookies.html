    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Butterscotch Cookies</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free butterscotch cookies is a straightforward process that yields delicious results. Follow these steps to create your own batch:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving the right texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in the Butterscotch Chips</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the butterscotch chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free butterscotch cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Butterscotch Cookies</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free butterscotch cookies turn out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Ingredients:</strong> The quality of your ingredients can significantly impact the final result. Opt for high-quality gluten-free flour and butterscotch chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined to maintain a tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too soft, chilling it for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add other mix-ins, such as nuts or chocolate chips, to customize your cookies.</li>
    </ul>
