<h2>Ingredients You'll Need</h2>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will ensure that your scones don't stick to the pan and will bake evenly.</p>

<h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. This ensures that the leavening agents are evenly distributed throughout the flour, which is crucial for achieving the right texture in your scones.</p>

<h3>3. Incorporate Butter</h3>
<p>Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. The cold butter is essential for creating a flaky texture in the scones.</p>

<h3>4. Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, egg, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and gently stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough scones.</p>

<h3>5. Shape and Cut</h3>
<p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently shape it into a circle about 1 inch thick. Cut the dough into 8 wedges, similar to how you would cut a pizza. Place the wedges onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each scone.</p>

<h3>6. Bake to Perfection</h3>
<p>Bake the scones in the preheated oven for 15-18 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. Allow them to cool slightly before serving. The aroma of lemon and butter will fill your kitchen, making it hard to resist diving in right away!</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Scones</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free scones can be a bit different from traditional scones, but with these tips, you'll achieve perfect results every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Cold Ingredients:</strong> Cold butter and cream are key to achieving a flaky texture. If the butter melts before baking, the scones will lose their flakiness.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to dense scones. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the Dough Rest:</strong> Allowing the dough to rest for 10-15 minutes before baking can help the gluten-free flours absorb the moisture, resulting in a better texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> While lemon is a classic choice, feel free to experiment with other flavors like orange zest, blueberries, or even a touch of lavender.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, but keep in mind that the texture may vary. A blend of gluten-free flours, such as almond flour and tapioca flour, often works well for scones.</p>

    <h3>Can I make these scones dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the heavy cream with a dairy-free alternative like coconut cream, and use a plant-based butter instead of regular butter.</p>

    <h3>How should I store leftover scones?</h3>
    <p>Store leftover scones in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to a month. Simply reheat in the oven before serving.</p>

    <h3>Can I add a glaze to these scones?</h3>
    <p>Yes, a simple lemon glaze made with powdered sugar and lemon juice can be drizzled over the scones for an extra burst of flavor. Just mix 1 cup of powdered sugar with 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice until smooth, and drizzle over the cooled scones.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free lemon scones are a delightful treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions. With their bright, citrusy flavor and tender, flaky texture, they are sure to become a favorite in your household. Whether you're new to gluten-free baking or a seasoned pro, this recipe is straightforward and yields delicious results.
