    <h1>Gluten-Free Lussekatter: A Delicious Twist on a Swedish Classic</h1>
    <p>Lussekatter, or saffron buns, are a beloved Swedish tradition, especially during the Advent season. These golden, saffron-infused buns are a staple of Lucia Day celebrations, bringing warmth and joy to the darkest days of winter. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying these festive treats can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free lussekatter—a delicious and inclusive twist on this classic recipe. In this blog post, we’ll explore the history of lussekatter, the benefits of going gluten-free, and how to make your own gluten-free lussekatter at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Lussekatter</h2>
    <p>Lussekatter, also known as St. Lucia buns, have a rich history rooted in Swedish culture. The tradition of baking these buns dates back to the 18th century, and they are closely associated with St. Lucia’s Day, celebrated on December 13th. The buns are shaped into an "S" or a curled shape, symbolizing the eyes of a cat, which is where the name "lussekatter" (meaning "Lucia cats") comes from. The bright yellow color, achieved by using saffron, represents light and hope during the long, dark Scandinavian winters.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity in recent years, not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals with gluten sensitivity or those seeking a healthier lifestyle. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems for some people. By opting for gluten-free lussekatter, you can enjoy this festive treat without compromising your health or dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Lussekatter</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your own gluten-free lussekatter:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Saffron:</strong> Soak the saffron threads in a small amount of warm milk for at least 30 minutes to release their flavor and color.</li>
        <li><strong>Activate the Yeast:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the dry yeast with a tablespoon of sugar and a small amount of warm milk. Let it sit for 10 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Add the activated yeast, saffron-infused milk, melted butter, and egg. Mix until a smooth dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead and Rest:</strong> Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-10 minutes. Place it in a greased bowl, cover with a clean cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Buns:</strong> Divide the dough into small portions and roll them into "S" shapes or curls. Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Decorate:</strong> Press a raisin into the center of each curl. Brush the buns with an egg wash for a golden finish.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 200°C (392°F) and bake the buns for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
