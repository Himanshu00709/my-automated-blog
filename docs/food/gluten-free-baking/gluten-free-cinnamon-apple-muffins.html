    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free cinnamon apple muffins:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with coconut oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, mix the unsweetened applesauce, eggs, honey or maple syrup, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in apples:</strong> Gently fold in the diced apples, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill muffin cups:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
