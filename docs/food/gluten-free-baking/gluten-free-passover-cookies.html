    <h1>Gluten-Free Passover Cookies: A Delicious Tradition</h1>
    <p>Passover is a time of reflection, tradition, and, of course, delicious food. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding the perfect Passover treats can be a challenge. However, with the right ingredients and a bit of creativity, you can enjoy gluten-free Passover cookies that are just as tasty as their traditional counterparts.

    <h2>The History of Passover Cookies</h2>
    <p>Passover, or Pesach, is a Jewish holiday that commemorates the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. During this time, certain dietary restrictions are observed, including the avoidance of leavened bread and other products containing chametz (leavened grains). This has led to the creation of unique Passover-friendly recipes, including cookies made with alternative flours like almond, coconut, or potato starch.</p>
    <p>Gluten-free Passover cookies have become increasingly popular as more people adopt gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference. These cookies not only adhere to Passover dietary laws but also cater to those who need or choose to avoid gluten.</p>
