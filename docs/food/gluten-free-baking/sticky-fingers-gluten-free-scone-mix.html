    <h2>What Makes Sticky Fingers Gluten-Free Scone Mix Special?</h2>

Unlike many gluten-free products that can be dense or dry, this mix produces scones that are tender, moist, and perfectly crumbly.

    <h2>How to Use Sticky Fingers Gluten-Free Scone Mix</h2>

    <p>Using Sticky Fingers Gluten-Free Scone Mix is incredibly straightforward, making it accessible to bakers of all skill levels. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating perfect scones every time:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Your Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to the temperature specified on the package, usually around 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Mix:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the scone mix with the required wet ingredients, typically cold butter and milk or a dairy-free alternative. Mix until the dough just comes together—be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Your Mix-Ins:</strong> If you're adding any extras, such as berries or cheese, gently fold them into the dough at this stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a circle or rectangle, depending on your preference. Cut the dough into wedges or squares.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the scones on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for the recommended time, usually 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy:</strong> Allow the scones to cool slightly before serving. They're best enjoyed fresh out of the oven with a cup of tea or coffee.</li>
