    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the process of making this delicious gluten-free banana blueberry bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a loaf pan with coconut oil or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure they are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. Add the eggs, honey or maple syrup, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Mix well until all the wet ingredients are fully combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fold in Blueberries</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the fresh blueberries into the batter. If you’re using frozen blueberries, toss them in a little gluten-free flour before adding them to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the bread.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve as is or with a dollop of your favorite nut butter.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use other gluten-free flours like coconut flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. However, keep in mind that different flours may alter the texture and moisture content of the bread.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this bread vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and use maple syrup instead of honey.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free banana blueberry bread is a versatile, healthy, and delicious treat that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. With its natural sweetness, moist texture, and nutrient-packed ingredients, it’s a perfect addition to your breakfast or snack routine. Whether you’re new to gluten-free baking or a seasoned pro, this recipe is sure to become a favorite in your household.
