    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and make cleanup easier.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Set this mixture aside.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving the right texture in your cookies.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Beat in the pumpkin puree, egg, and vanilla extract until well combined. The pumpkin puree not only adds flavor but also keeps the cookies moist.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense cookies.</p>

    <h3>6. Prepare the Coating</h3>
    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the granulated sugar and cinnamon for the coating. This will give your cookies their signature snickerdoodle look and taste.</p>

    <h3>7. Shape and Coat the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, form the dough into balls. Roll each ball in the cinnamon-sugar mixture until fully coated, then place them on the prepared baking sheet.</p>

    <h3>8. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. The centers should still be soft. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pumpkin Snickerdoodles</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that’s specifically designed for baking to ensure the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky to handle, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before shaping the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Keep the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute regular all-purpose flour if you don’t need the cookies to be gluten-free. However, the texture may vary slightly.</p>

        <h3>Can I use canned pumpkin puree?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Canned pumpkin puree works just as well as homemade. Just make sure it’s pure pumpkin puree and not pumpkin pie filling, which contains added sugars and spices.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make vegan gluten-free pumpkin snickerdoodles by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of a regular egg.</p>

        <h3>How do I know when the cookies are done?</h3>
        <p>The cookies are done when the edges are lightly golden, but the centers are still soft. They will continue to firm up as they cool on the baking sheet.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free pumpkin snickerdoodles are a delightful treat that captures the essence of fall in every bite. With their soft, chewy texture and warm spices, these cookies are sure to become a seasonal favorite. Whether you're baking for yourself, your family, or a gathering of friends, this recipe is a wonderful way to celebrate the flavors of autumn. So, roll up your sleeves, preheat your oven, and get ready to enjoy the comforting aroma and taste of these delicious cookies. Happy baking!</p>
