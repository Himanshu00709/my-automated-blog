    <h1>Sarah Bakes Gluten-Free: A Journey of Flavor and Health</h1>
    <p>In a world where dietary restrictions are becoming increasingly common, Sarah has emerged as a beacon of hope for those who love baked goods but cannot tolerate gluten. Her journey into gluten-free baking is not just about creating delicious treats; it's about redefining what it means to enjoy food without compromise. This blog post delves into Sarah's story, her techniques, and the impact she has made on the gluten-free community.</p>

    <h2>The Beginning of Sarah's Gluten-Free Journey</h2>
    <p>Sarah's journey into gluten-free baking began out of necessity. Diagnosed with celiac disease in her early twenties, she was forced to eliminate gluten from her diet entirely. At first, this seemed like a daunting task, especially for someone who had always loved baking. However, Sarah saw this as an opportunity to explore new ingredients and techniques, rather than a limitation.</p>
    <p>She started experimenting with alternative flours like almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour. Over time, she developed a deep understanding of how these flours interact with other ingredients, leading to the creation of recipes that were not only gluten-free but also incredibly flavorful and satisfying.</p>

    <h2>The Art of Gluten-Free Baking</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking is often seen as a challenge due to the absence of gluten, which provides structure and elasticity to baked goods. However, Sarah has mastered the art of using alternative ingredients to achieve similar results. Here are some of her key techniques:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>

                <th>Example Use</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Xanthan Gum</td>
                <td>Provides elasticity and structure</td>
                <td>Used in gluten-free bread to mimic the texture of traditional bread</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Psyllium Husk</td>
                <td>Adds moisture and binding properties</td>
                <td>Used in gluten-free muffins to keep them moist</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Almond Flour</td>
                <td>Adds richness and a nutty flavor</td>
                <td>Used in gluten-free cookies for a chewy texture</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Coconut Flour</td>
                <td>Absorbs moisture and adds a light texture</td>
                <td>Used in gluten-free cakes for a fluffy crumb</td>
            </tr>
