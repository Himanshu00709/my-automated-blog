    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the scones from sticking and ensure even baking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. This ensures that the leavening agents are evenly distributed throughout the flour, which is crucial for achieving the right texture.</p>

    <h3>3. Incorporate Butter</h3>
    <p>Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. The cold butter is essential for creating a flaky texture in the scones.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, egg, and vanilla extract. Pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and gently stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough scones.</p>

    <h3>5. Fold in Blueberries and Lemon Zest</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the fresh blueberries and lemon zest. The lemon zest adds a bright, citrusy flavor that complements the sweetness of the blueberries perfectly.</p>

    <h3>6. Shape and Cut</h3>
    <p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a circle about 1 inch thick. Cut the circle into 8 wedges and place them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each scone.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake</h3>
    <p>Bake the scones in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. Allow them to cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Scones</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free scones can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be able to achieve perfect results every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Good Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right combination of flours and starches to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep Ingredients Cold:</strong> Cold butter and cold cream are key to achieving a flaky texture. If the butter melts before baking, the scones will be dense rather than light and airy.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough scones. Mix just until the ingredients are combined, and then stop.</li>
        <li><strong>Add a Glaze (Optional):</strong> For an extra touch of sweetness, you can drizzle a simple glaze made from powdered sugar and lemon juice over the cooled scones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen blueberries, but be sure to add them directly from the freezer without thawing. Thawed blueberries can release too much moisture and affect the texture of the scones.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these scones dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the heavy cream with a dairy-free alternative like coconut cream, and use a dairy-free butter substitute. Just make sure the butter substitute is cold when you incorporate it into the dough.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store leftover scones?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover scones in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the scones and reheat them in the oven when ready to serve.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free lemon blueberry scones are a delightful treat that combines the bright flavors of lemon and blueberry with a tender, crumbly texture. Whether you're new to gluten-free baking or a seasoned pro, this recipe is sure to become a favorite. With a few simple tips and tricks, you can achieve perfect scones every time.
