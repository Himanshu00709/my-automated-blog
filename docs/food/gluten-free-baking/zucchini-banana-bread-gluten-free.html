    <h1>Zucchini Banana Bread: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>
    <p>When it comes to baking, combining health and flavor can sometimes feel like a challenge. However, zucchini banana bread is a perfect example of how you can create a delicious, moist, and nutritious treat that caters to gluten-free diets. This bread is not only a great way to use up overripe bananas and zucchini but also a fantastic option for those looking to reduce their gluten intake without sacrificing taste.

When paired with bananas, which are rich in potassium and natural sugars, this bread becomes a powerhouse of nutrients.</p>
    <p>Moreover, making this bread gluten-free ensures that it can be enjoyed by individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. By using gluten-free flours like almond flour, oat flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose blend, you can create a bread that is just as satisfying as its traditional counterpart.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free zucchini banana bread:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, mash the bananas until smooth. Add the grated zucchini, eggs, honey or maple syrup, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. If desired, fold in chopped nuts or chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and enjoy!</li>
