    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s walk through the baking process step by step:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. Set this aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugars:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the egg and vanilla:</strong> Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined. Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure everything is evenly mixed.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to tough cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the cranberries and white chocolate:</strong> Gently fold in the dried cranberries and white chocolate chips using a spatula. This ensures that the add-ins are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your delicious gluten-free cranberry and white chocolate cookies!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right combination of flours and starches to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense and tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough:</strong> If you have the time, chilling the dough for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch the baking time:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can go from underbaked to overbaked quickly, so keep a close eye on them, especially during the last few minutes of baking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh cranberries instead of dried?</h3>
        <p>While you can use fresh cranberries, they have a higher moisture content, which can affect the texture of the cookies. If you choose to use fresh cranberries, consider reducing the amount slightly and chopping them into smaller pieces.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute the white chocolate with dark chocolate?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer a richer, less sweet cookie, dark chocolate chips or chunks can be a great substitute for white chocolate.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>These cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these cookies vegan by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of a regular egg.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free cranberry and white chocolate cookies are a delightful treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and a bit of care, you can create cookies that are just as delicious as traditional ones. Whether you’re baking for a special occasion or just to satisfy a sweet craving, these cookies are sure to be a hit. So, preheat your oven, gather your ingredients, and get ready to bake a batch of these irresistible gluten-free cookies!</p>
