    <h1>Gluten-Free Cranberry and White Chocolate Cookies</h1>
    <p>When it comes to baking, gluten-free options have become increasingly popular, and for good reason. Whether you're managing celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or simply looking to reduce gluten in your diet, gluten-free baking can be just as delicious and satisfying as traditional baking. One of the most delightful treats you can make is gluten-free cranberry and white chocolate cookies. These cookies are a perfect blend of tart cranberries and sweet white chocolate, creating a flavor profile that is both balanced and indulgent. In this article, we'll explore the recipe, tips for perfecting these cookies, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Baking?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free baking has gained traction not only among those with gluten-related disorders but also among health-conscious individuals. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues for some people. By using gluten-free flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend, you can create baked goods that are just as tasty and satisfying as their gluten-containing counterparts. The key to successful gluten-free baking lies in understanding the properties of alternative flours and how they interact with other ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free cranberry and white chocolate cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugars:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Cranberries and White Chocolate:</strong> Gently fold in the dried cranberries and white chocolate chips.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and Bake:</strong> Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be able to achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right combination of flours and starches to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix the dough until just combined to ensure a tender texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too soft, chilling it for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Baking Time:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can go from underbaked to overbaked quickly. Keep a close eye on them and remove them from the oven as soon as the edges are lightly golden.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh cranberries instead of dried?</h3>
        <p>Fresh cranberries can be used, but they will add more moisture to the cookies, which may affect the texture. If using fresh cranberries, consider reducing the amount slightly and chopping them before adding to the dough.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute the white chocolate with dark chocolate?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you prefer a richer flavor, dark chocolate chips or chunks can be used in place of white chocolate. The tartness of the cranberries pairs well with both types of chocolate.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these cookies vegan by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative and using a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) in place of the egg.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free cranberry and white chocolate cookies are a delightful treat that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions. With the right ingredients and techniques, you can create cookies that are just as delicious and satisfying as their gluten-containing counterparts. Whether you're baking for a special occasion or just to satisfy a sweet craving, these cookies are sure to be a hit. Happy baking!</p>
