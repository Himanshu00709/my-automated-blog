    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Cowboy Cookies</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free cowboy cookies is a straightforward process, but there are a few key steps to ensure they turn out perfectly. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and make cleanup easier.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, rolled oats, baking soda, and salt. Set this mixture aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugars</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, mix in the vanilla extract until everything is well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to tough cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in the Mix-Ins</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the chocolate chips, chopped nuts, and shredded coconut until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers are still soft.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your delicious gluten-free cowboy cookies!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cowboy Cookies</h2>

    <p>Here are a few tips to ensure your gluten-free cowboy cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If you have time, chilling the dough for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent the cookies from spreading too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Mix-Ins:</strong> Feel free to get creative with your mix-ins. Dried fruit, white chocolate chips, or even a sprinkle of cinnamon can add a unique twist to your cookies.</li>
    </ul>
