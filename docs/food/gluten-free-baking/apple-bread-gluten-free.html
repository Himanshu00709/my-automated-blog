    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your gluten-free apple bread:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a loaf pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the applesauce, eggs, honey or maple syrup, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
