    <h1>Gluten-Free Pumpkin Cornbread: A Delicious Fall Treat</h1>
    <p>As the leaves change color and the air turns crisp, there's nothing quite like the comforting aroma of freshly baked cornbread wafting through your kitchen. But for those who follow a gluten-free diet, traditional cornbread can be off-limits.

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Pumpkin Cornbread?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, not only for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also for individuals seeking healthier eating habits. Traditional cornbread often contains wheat flour, which is a no-go for those avoiding gluten.

Pumpkin is also packed with nutrients like vitamin A, fiber, and antioxidants, making this cornbread a healthier option.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free pumpkin cornbread:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free cornmeal, gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and pumpkin pie spice.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the pumpkin puree, eggs, milk, honey (or maple syrup), and melted butter (or coconut oil) until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the cornbread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve warm with butter or your favorite spread.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pumpkin Cornbread</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free pumpkin cornbread turns out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use high-quality gluten-free flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that mimics the texture of all-purpose flour for the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense and tough cornbread. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a sweeter cornbread, you can increase the amount of honey or maple syrup to 1/2 cup.</li>
        <li><strong>Add-ins:</strong> Feel free to customize your cornbread by adding chopped nuts, dried cranberries, or even a handful of chocolate chips.</li>
    </ul>
