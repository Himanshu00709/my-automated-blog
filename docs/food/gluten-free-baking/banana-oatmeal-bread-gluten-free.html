    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free banana oatmeal bread is simple and straightforward. Follow these steps to create a delicious loaf:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a loaf pan with a little oil or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the oats:</strong> In a blender or food processor, grind the gluten-free rolled oats into a fine flour. This will give your bread a smoother texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Mash the bananas:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth. You can leave a few small chunks for added texture if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> Add the eggs, almond milk, maple syrup, and vanilla extract to the mashed bananas. Mix well until all ingredients are fully combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the oat flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt to the wet mixture. Stir until just combined, being careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve as desired.</li>
    </ol>
