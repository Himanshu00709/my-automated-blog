    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Activate the Yeast:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the warm milk, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum (if needed), and salt. Add the activated yeast mixture, melted butter, and egg. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
        <li><strong>First Rise:</strong> Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> While the dough is rising, prepare your chosen filling. For a sweet option, mix cinnamon and sugar. For a savory option, consider grated cheese or pesto.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Star:</strong> Once the dough has risen, divide it into four equal parts. Roll each part into a circle about 10 inches in diameter. Layer the circles with your chosen filling between each layer. Cut the stacked circles into 16 equal wedges, then twist and shape them into a star.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Rise:</strong> Let the shaped bread rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake the star bread for 20-25 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Allow the bread to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy it warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
