<h1>Gluten-Free Italian Ricotta Cookies: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>

<p>Italian ricotta cookies are a classic dessert that has been enjoyed for generations. These soft, cake-like cookies are traditionally made with ricotta cheese, which gives them a unique texture and flavor. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying these cookies can be a challenge. That's where gluten-free Italian ricotta cookies come in! In this blog post, we'll explore everything you need to know about making these delicious cookies, including tips, tricks, and a step-by-step recipe.</p>

<h2>What Are Italian Ricotta Cookies?</h2>

<p>Italian ricotta cookies are a type of cookie that originated in Italy. They are known for their soft, cake-like texture and are often flavored with lemon or almond extract. The addition of ricotta cheese not only adds moisture but also gives the cookies a slight tanginess that balances the sweetness. Traditionally, these cookies are topped with a simple glaze and colorful sprinkles, making them a festive treat for holidays and special occasions.</p>

<h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular in recent years, not only for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also for individuals looking to improve their overall health. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause digestive issues and inflammation in some people. By using gluten-free flour blends, you can enjoy the same delicious Italian ricotta cookies without the negative effects of gluten.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and make cleanup easier.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set this aside.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Cream Butter and Sugar</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>Add the ricotta cheese, egg, vanilla extract, and lemon zest to the butter-sugar mixture. Mix until well combined.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense cookies.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Scoop and Bake</h3>
<p>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Prepare the Glaze</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and milk until smooth. The glaze should be thick but pourable. If it's too thick, add a little more milk; if it's too thin, add more powdered sugar.</p>

<h3>Step 8: Glaze and Decorate</h3>
<p>Once the cookies are completely cool, dip the tops into the glaze and allow any excess to drip off. Place the cookies back on the wire rack and immediately add sprinkles if desired. Allow the glaze to set before serving.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Italian Ricotta Cookies</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined to ensure a tender texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky to handle, chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before scooping and baking.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> While lemon zest is traditional, you can also try almond extract or orange zest for a different flavor profile.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use regular all-purpose flour if you don't need the cookies to be gluten-free. However, the texture may be slightly different.</p>

    <h3>Can I freeze these cookies?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months. Store them in an airtight container with parchment paper between layers to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Can I use a different type of cheese?</h3>
    <p>Ricotta cheese is essential for the texture and flavor of these cookies. Substituting it with another type of cheese will alter the final product.</p>

    <h3>How long do these cookies stay fresh?</h3>
    <p>These cookies will stay fresh for up to 3 days when stored in an airtight container at room temperature.</p>
