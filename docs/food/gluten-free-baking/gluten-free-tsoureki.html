    <h1>Gluten-Free Tsoureki: A Delicious Twist on a Traditional Greek Bread</h1>
    <p>Tsoureki, a traditional Greek sweet bread, is a staple during Easter celebrations. Its rich, buttery flavor and soft, braided texture make it a favorite among many. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying this delicacy can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free tsoureki—a delightful alternative that retains the essence of the original while catering to dietary restrictions. In this article, we’ll explore the history of tsoureki, the challenges of making it gluten-free, and provide a step-by-step guide to creating your own gluten-free version at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Tsoureki</h2>
    <p>Tsoureki has a long history in Greek culture, dating back to ancient times. Originally, it was a simple bread made with flour, water, and yeast. Over the centuries, it evolved into a richer, sweeter bread, often flavored with aromatic spices like mahleb and mastic. The bread is traditionally braided, symbolizing the Holy Trinity, and is often adorned with red-dyed eggs, representing the blood of Christ. Today, tsoureki is enjoyed not only during Easter but also throughout the year as a sweet treat.</p>

    <h2>Challenges of Making Gluten-Free Tsoureki</h2>
    <p>Creating a gluten-free version of tsoureki presents several challenges. The primary issue is replicating the texture and elasticity that gluten provides. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, which gives bread its structure and chewiness. Without gluten, bread can become dense and crumbly. To overcome this, gluten-free bakers often use a combination of alternative flours and binding agents like xanthan gum or psyllium husk. Additionally, the flavor profile of tsoureki, which relies heavily on the richness of butter and the aromatic spices, must be carefully balanced to ensure the gluten-free version is just as delicious.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Tsoureki</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create your own gluten-free tsoureki:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Activate the Yeast:</strong> In a small bowl, combine the yeast with 1 tablespoon of sugar and 50ml of warm milk. Let it sit for 10 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, and remaining sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, melted butter, and the remaining milk. Add the activated yeast mixture and mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Dough:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms. If using, add the mahleb, mastic, and orange zest.</li>
        <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. Gluten-free dough will be stickier than traditional dough, so be patient.</li>
        <li><strong>First Rise:</strong> Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Tsoureki:</strong> Once risen, divide the dough into three equal parts. Roll each part into a long rope and braid them together. Place the braided dough on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Rise:</strong> Cover the braided dough with a towel and let it rise for another 30-45 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Brush the tsoureki with an egg wash (1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon of water) and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the tsoureki to cool on a wire rack before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
