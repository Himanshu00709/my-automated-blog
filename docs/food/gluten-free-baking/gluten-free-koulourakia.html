    <h1>Gluten-Free Koulourakia: A Delicious Twist on a Greek Classic</h1>
    <p>Koulourakia, the traditional Greek butter cookies, are a staple in Greek households, especially during Easter and other festive occasions. These delightful treats are known for their buttery flavor, tender crumb, and intricate shapes. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying these cookies can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free koulourakia—a delicious and inclusive twist on this beloved classic. In this article, we’ll explore the history of koulourakia, the benefits of going gluten-free, and provide a step-by-step guide to making your own gluten-free koulourakia at home.</p>

    <h2>The History of Koulourakia</h2>
    <p>Koulourakia have been a part of Greek culinary tradition for centuries. These cookies are often associated with Easter, where they are served alongside other traditional foods like tsoureki (a sweet bread) and red-dyed eggs. The name "koulourakia" is derived from the Greek word "kouloura," which means a round or twisted shape, reflecting the cookie's characteristic form. Traditionally, koulourakia are made with simple ingredients like flour, butter, sugar, and eggs, but the gluten-free version substitutes wheat flour with alternative flours like almond, rice, or a gluten-free flour blend.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity in recent years, not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals seeking to improve their overall health. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems for some people. By opting for gluten-free koulourakia, you can enjoy the same delicious flavors without the adverse effects of gluten. Additionally, gluten-free baking often incorporates nutrient-dense ingredients like almond flour, which adds a rich, nutty flavor and boosts the nutritional profile of the cookies.</p>
