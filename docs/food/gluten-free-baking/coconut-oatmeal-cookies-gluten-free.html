    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free coconut oatmeal cookies is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create your own batch of delicious, healthy cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free oats, shredded coconut, almond flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted coconut oil, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until a thick dough forms. If the dough feels too dry, you can add a tablespoon of almond milk or water.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Cookies:</strong> Scoop out tablespoon-sized portions of the dough and roll them into balls. Place them on the prepared baking sheet and gently flatten them with your hand or a fork.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Be careful not to overbake, as they can dry out.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free coconut oatmeal cookies with a cup of tea or coffee!</li>
