    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Apple Muffins</h2>

    <p>Now that you know the key ingredients, let’s walk through the process of making these delicious muffins:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly with coconut oil to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of gluten-free flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Whisk these ingredients together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Prepare Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together 2 large eggs, 1/2 cup of natural sweetener (like honey or maple syrup), 1/4 cup of melted coconut oil, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Stir in 1 cup of grated or finely chopped apples.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently fold them together until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fill Muffin Tin</h3>
    <p>Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 3/4 full. For added texture, sprinkle a few chopped apple pieces or a dash of cinnamon on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake and Cool</h3>
    <p>Bake the muffins for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Apple Muffins</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use any type of apple for this recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any variety of apple, but tart apples like Granny Smith or sweet apples like Honeycrisp work particularly well. The choice of apple will influence the sweetness and texture of the muffins.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make these muffins vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons of water per egg) and use a plant-based sweetener like maple syrup.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store gluten-free apple muffins?</h3>
        <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>4. Are gluten-free muffins healthier than regular muffins?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free muffins can be healthier if they are made with nutrient-dense flours and natural sweeteners. However, it’s important to check the ingredients, as some gluten-free products may still contain high levels of sugar and fat.</p>
