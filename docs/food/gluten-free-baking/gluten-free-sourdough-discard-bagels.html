<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<p>Follow these steps to make your gluten-free sourdough discard bagels:</p>

<h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free sourdough discard, gluten-free flour blend, water, olive oil, honey (or maple syrup), salt, and baking powder. Mix until a dough forms. The dough should be slightly sticky but manageable. If it’s too dry, add a little more water; if it’s too wet, add a bit more flour.</p>

<h3>2. Shape the Bagels</h3>
<p>Divide the dough into 6 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball, then use your thumb to create a hole in the center, shaping it into a bagel. Place the shaped bagels on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</p>

<h3>3. Let the Bagels Rest</h3>
<p>Cover the bagels with a clean kitchen towel and let them rest for 30 minutes. This allows the dough to relax and the flavors to develop.</p>

<h3>4. Preheat the Oven</h3>
<p>While the bagels are resting, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). If desired, you can also prepare a pot of boiling water to give the bagels a quick boil before baking, which will give them a chewier texture.</p>

<h3>5. Bake the Bagels</h3>
<p>If you choose to boil the bagels, do so for 1-2 minutes on each side before transferring them back to the baking sheet. Bake the bagels in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped.</p>

<h3>6. Cool and Enjoy</h3>
<p>Allow the bagels to cool on a wire rack before slicing and serving. Enjoy them plain, toasted, or with your favorite toppings!</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Sourdough Discard Bagels</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use any gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend, but it’s best to choose one that includes xanthan gum. This helps mimic the elasticity of gluten and gives the bagels a better texture.</p>

    <h3>2. How long can I store the bagels?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free sourdough discard bagels can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make these bagels without a sourdough starter?</h3>
    <p>While the sourdough discard adds flavor and texture, you can make gluten-free bagels without it. Simply replace the discard with an equal amount of gluten-free flour and water, and add a bit more yeast or baking powder for rise.</p>

    <h3>4. Are these bagels suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>Yes, these bagels can be made vegan by substituting the honey with maple syrup or another plant-based sweetener.</p>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Gluten-free sourdough discard bagels are a delicious and nutritious way to enjoy a classic breakfast treat while adhering to a gluten-free diet. By using sourdough discard, you not only reduce food waste but also add a unique flavor and health benefits to your bagels. With the right ingredients and a little patience, you can create chewy, flavorful bagels that everyone will love. Whether you’re a seasoned sourdough baker or new to gluten-free baking, these bagels are sure to become a staple in your kitchen.</p>
