    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Pumpkin Biscuits</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making these delightful biscuits:</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This ensures that your biscuits won't stick and will bake evenly.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of gluten-free flour blend, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon of ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Whisk these ingredients together to ensure even distribution.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Incorporate Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, mix 1/2 cup of pumpkin puree, 1/4 cup of melted butter or coconut oil, and 1/2 cup of milk or non-dairy alternative. Stir until well combined. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the biscuits dense.</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Shape and Cut the Biscuits</h3>
    <p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour) and gently knead it a few times. Roll the dough to about 1-inch thickness and use a biscuit cutter or a glass to cut out rounds. Place the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each one.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Bake the biscuits in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pumpkin Biscuits</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free pumpkin biscuits turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough biscuits. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough feels too sticky, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before shaping and cutting.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Consider adding chopped nuts, dried cranberries, or chocolate chips for extra flavor and texture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pumpkin Biscuits</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned puree?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use fresh pumpkin puree. Simply roast a sugar pumpkin, remove the skin, and blend the flesh until smooth. Make sure the puree is not too watery, as this can affect the texture of the biscuits.</p>
        <h3>Can I make these biscuits vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Substitute the butter with coconut oil and use a non-dairy milk alternative like almond or oat milk. Ensure your baking powder is also vegan-friendly.</p>
        <h3>How should I store leftover biscuits?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover biscuits in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, freeze the biscuits in a freezer-safe bag for up to 3 months. Reheat in the oven or toaster before serving.</p>
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>While a gluten-free flour blend is recommended, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like almond flour or oat flour. Keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary.</p>

With the right ingredients and techniques, you can create biscuits that are tender, flavorful, and perfect for any occasion.
