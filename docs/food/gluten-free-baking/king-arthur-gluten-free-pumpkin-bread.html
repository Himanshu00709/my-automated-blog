    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the baking process:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and pumpkin pie spice.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, eggs, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 60-70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pumpkin Bread</h2>

    <p>To ensure your pumpkin bread turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use fresh ingredients:</strong> Make sure your baking powder and baking soda are fresh to ensure proper rising.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense loaf. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking your bread at the 60-minute mark. If the top is browning too quickly, cover it loosely with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it cool:</strong> Allowing the bread to cool completely before slicing will help it set and make it easier to cut.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>While King Arthur's Gluten-Free Measure for Measure Flour is specifically formulated for baking, you can use other gluten-free flours. However, the texture and rise may vary, so results may differ.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this recipe dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, this recipe is naturally dairy-free, so no substitutions are needed. Just ensure that all your ingredients, including the pumpkin puree, are dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the pumpkin bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or chocolate chips?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Feel free to add 1/2 to 1 cup of chopped nuts, chocolate chips, or even dried fruit to the batter before baking for added texture and flavor.</p>
