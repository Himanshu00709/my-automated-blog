    <h1>Gluten-Free Crumble with Tapioca Flour (No Oats or Almond Flour)</h1>

    <p>For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding the perfect crumble topping can be a challenge, especially when avoiding common ingredients like oats and almond flour. Tapioca flour, a versatile and naturally gluten-free ingredient, offers a fantastic alternative. In this article, we’ll explore how to create a delicious gluten-free crumble using tapioca flour, without relying on oats or almond flour. Whether you're baking a fruit crumble or a savory dish, this recipe will become a staple in your kitchen.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Tapioca Flour for Gluten-Free Baking?</h2>

    <p>Tapioca flour, derived from the cassava root, is a popular gluten-free flour known for its light texture and binding properties. Unlike almond flour, which can be dense and nutty, tapioca flour provides a neutral flavor and a crisp, airy texture. It’s also a great option for those with nut allergies. Additionally, tapioca flour is grain-free, making it suitable for paleo and grain-free diets.</p>

    <p>Here are some key benefits of using tapioca flour in your crumble:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Light and Crisp Texture:</strong> Tapioca flour creates a delicate, crispy crumble that pairs perfectly with soft, baked fruits.</li>
        <li><strong>Neutral Flavor:</strong> It doesn’t overpower the natural flavors of your dish, allowing the fruit or other ingredients to shine.</li>
        <li><strong>Binding Agent:</strong> Tapioca flour helps hold the crumble together without the need for gluten or eggs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free crumble topping:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine the tapioca flour, coconut sugar, ground cinnamon, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Cold Butter:</strong> Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Use your fingers or a pastry cutter to blend the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> While the crumble mixture rests, prepare your fruit filling. You can use apples, berries, peaches, or any fruit of your choice. Toss the fruit with a little sugar and lemon juice to enhance the flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble and Bake:</strong> Spread the fruit filling in a baking dish and sprinkle the crumble mixture evenly over the top. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the crumble to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Crumble</h2>

    <p>Here are some expert tips to ensure your gluten-free crumble turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Cold Butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for achieving a crumbly texture. If the butter melts too soon, the crumble will become dense.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Mix the crumble ingredients just until combined. Overmixing can lead to a tough topping.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Add a pinch of nutmeg, cardamom, or ginger to the crumble mixture for a unique twist.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> Depending on the sweetness of your fruit, you can adjust the amount of sugar in the crumble topping.</li>
    </ul>
