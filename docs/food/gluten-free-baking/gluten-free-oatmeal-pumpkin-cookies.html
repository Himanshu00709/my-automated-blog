        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, maple syrup, melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms. If using, fold in the dark chocolate chips.</li>
