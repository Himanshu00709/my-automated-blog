    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free strawberry scones is a straightforward process, but it requires attention to detail to achieve the perfect texture and flavor. Follow these steps to create your own batch of delicious scones:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the scones from sticking and ensure even baking.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps in the final product.</p>

    <h3>3. Incorporate Butter</h3>
    <p>Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry ingredients. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. This step is crucial for achieving a flaky texture.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, egg, and vanilla extract. Pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough scones.</p>

    <h3>5. Fold in Strawberries</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the chopped strawberries into the dough. The strawberries will release some moisture, so handle the dough carefully to avoid making it too wet.</p>

    <h3>6. Shape and Cut</h3>
    <p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a circle about 1 inch thick. Cut the circle into 8 wedges and place them on the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each scone.</p>

    <h3>7. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Bake the scones in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. Allow them to cool slightly before serving.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free strawberry scones turn out perfectly every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use cold butter:</strong> Cold butter is essential for creating a flaky texture. If the butter melts before baking, the scones will lose their desired flakiness.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix:</strong> Overmixing the dough can lead to tough scones. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose ripe strawberries:</strong> Ripe strawberries will provide the best flavor and natural sweetness. Avoid using strawberries that are too soft or mushy.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flours:</strong> Different gluten-free flour blends can yield slightly different textures. Feel free to experiment to find the blend that works best for you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use frozen strawberries instead of fresh?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use frozen strawberries, but be sure to thaw and drain them thoroughly before adding them to the dough. Excess moisture can affect the texture of the scones.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these scones dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the heavy cream with a dairy-free alternative like coconut cream and use a dairy-free butter substitute. The texture may vary slightly, but the scones will still be delicious.</p>

        <h3>How should I store leftover scones?</h3>
        <p>Store leftover scones in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the scones and reheat them in the oven when ready to serve.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other fruits to the scones?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other fruits like blueberries, raspberries, or even diced peaches. Just be mindful of the moisture content of the fruit you choose.</p>
