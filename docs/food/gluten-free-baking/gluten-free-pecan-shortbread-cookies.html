    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free pecan shortbread cookies is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to create your own batch of delicious cookies:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly and achieve the perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract and mix well. Gradually add the gluten-free flour blend and salt, mixing until the dough comes together. Fold in the chopped pecans.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Shape the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Roll the dough into a log shape, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap the log in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This helps the dough firm up, making it easier to slice.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Slice and Bake</h3>
    <p>Once the dough is firm, remove it from the refrigerator and slice it into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Place the rounds on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your gluten-free pecan shortbread cookies with a cup of tea or coffee!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pecan Shortbread Cookies</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of nut instead of pecans?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute pecans with other nuts such as walnuts, almonds, or hazelnuts. Each nut will bring a unique flavor and texture to the cookies.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to three months.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make these cookies vegan by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative, such as coconut oil or vegan margarine. Ensure that all other ingredients are also vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>Are these cookies suitable for people with celiac disease?</h3>
        <p>Yes, as long as you use certified gluten-free ingredients, these cookies are safe for people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.</p>
