    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create the perfect gluten-free peppermint sugar cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg, vanilla extract, and peppermint extract, and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine dry ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add this mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until a smooth dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the cookies:</strong> Roll the dough into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving enough space between each cookie to allow for spreading.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the peppermint topping:</strong> Gently press the crushed peppermint candies onto the top of each cookie. This will give them a festive look and an extra burst of minty flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake, as gluten-free cookies can dry out quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your delicious gluten-free peppermint sugar cookies!</li>
    </ol>
