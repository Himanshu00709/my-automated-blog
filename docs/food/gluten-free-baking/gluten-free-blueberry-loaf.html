    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Baking a gluten-free blueberry loaf is a straightforward process, but it requires attention to detail to ensure the best results. Follow these steps to create a loaf that’s moist, tender, and bursting with blueberry goodness:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Set your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a loaf pan with non-stick spray or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the eggs (or flax eggs), applesauce (or mashed banana), milk, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to a dense loaf.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in blueberries:</strong> Gently fold the blueberries into the batter, ensuring they are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the loaf to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for the Best Gluten-Free Blueberry Loaf</h2>
    <p>To ensure your gluten-free blueberry loaf turns out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense and gummy loaf. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Add a streusel topping:</strong> For an extra touch of sweetness and crunch, consider adding a gluten-free streusel topping made with almond flour, coconut sugar, and a bit of butter or coconut oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Keep your loaf in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze it for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>Can I use frozen blueberries instead of fresh ones?</h3>
        <p>Yes, frozen blueberries work just as well as fresh ones. However, be sure to toss them in a bit of gluten-free flour before folding them into the batter to prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the loaf.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this loaf vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and use a plant-based milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>What can I use instead of applesauce or mashed banana?</h3>
        <p>If you don’t have applesauce or mashed banana on hand, you can use an equal amount of Greek yogurt or pumpkin puree as a substitute.</p>

        <h3>How do I know when the loaf is done baking?</h3>
        <p>Insert a toothpick into the center of the loaf. If it comes out clean or with a few crumbs (but no wet batter), the loaf is done. Be careful not to overbake, as this can dry out the loaf.</p>
