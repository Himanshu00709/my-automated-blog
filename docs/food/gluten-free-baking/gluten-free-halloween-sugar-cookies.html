    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free Halloween Sugar Cookies</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by creaming together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a smooth dough forms. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill it in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Roll and Cut the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Once the dough is chilled, roll it out on a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour to prevent sticking). Use Halloween-themed cookie cutters to cut out shapes like ghosts, pumpkins, bats, and witches. Place the cut-out cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the cookies for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake, as gluten-free cookies can dry out quickly. Allow the cookies to cool completely on a wire rack before decorating.</p>

    <h2>Creative Decorating Ideas for Gluten-Free Halloween Sugar Cookies</h2>

    <p>Decorating Halloween sugar cookies is where the real fun begins! Here are some creative ideas to make your cookies stand out:</p>

        <li><strong>Royal Icing:</strong> Use gluten-free royal icing to create intricate designs on your cookies. You can pipe on spider webs, jack-o’-lantern faces, or ghostly expressions.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprinkles and Edible Glitter:</strong> Add a touch of sparkle with gluten-free sprinkles and edible glitter. These are perfect for adding a magical touch to your cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Food Coloring:</strong> Use natural food coloring to create vibrant orange, black, and purple hues for your Halloween-themed cookies.</li>
