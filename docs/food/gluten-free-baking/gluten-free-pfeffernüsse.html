    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and molasses, and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. The dough should be firm but pliable.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into small balls, about 1 inch in diameter, and place them on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the cookies are set and lightly browned on the bottom. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Once the cookies are completely cool, roll them in powdered sugar until evenly coated. Store in an airtight container for up to two weeks.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pfeffernüsse</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free pfeffernüsse can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to achieve the perfect texture and flavor:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the dough rest:</strong> Allowing the dough to rest for 30 minutes before baking can help the flavors meld and improve the texture of the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> Pfeffernüsse are best when stored in an airtight container. They tend to soften over time, which is part of their charm.</li>
    </ul>
