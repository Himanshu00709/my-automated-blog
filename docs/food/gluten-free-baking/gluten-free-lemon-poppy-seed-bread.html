    <h1>Gluten-Free Lemon Poppy Seed Bread: A Delightful Treat</h1>

    <p>Gluten-free baking has become increasingly popular, and for good reason. Whether you have celiac disease, a gluten sensitivity, or simply want to explore healthier baking options, gluten-free recipes can be just as delicious and satisfying as their traditional counterparts.

This delightful treat combines the zesty flavor of lemon with the subtle crunch of poppy seeds, creating a moist and flavorful bread that’s perfect for breakfast, a snack, or even dessert.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Lemon Poppy Seed Bread?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free lemon poppy seed bread is not only a tasty option but also a healthier alternative for those who need to avoid gluten.

Additionally, the use of fresh lemon juice and zest provides a burst of citrusy freshness, while poppy seeds add a delightful crunch and a hint of nuttiness.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free lemon poppy seed bread:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Lemon:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the fresh lemon juice and lemon zest. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in Poppy Seeds and Yogurt:</strong> Gently fold in the poppy seeds and yogurt until evenly distributed throughout the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Lemon Poppy Seed Bread</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free lemon poppy seed bread turns out perfectly every time, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Lemons:</strong> Fresh lemon juice and zest provide the best flavor. Avoid using bottled lemon juice if possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense and tough bread. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Oven temperatures can vary, so start checking the bread for doneness around the 45-minute mark. If the top is browning too quickly, cover it with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or refrigerate for up to a week. You can also freeze the bread for up to 3 months.</li>
    </ul>
