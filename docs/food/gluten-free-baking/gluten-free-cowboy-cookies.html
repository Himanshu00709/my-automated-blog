    <h2>What Are Cowboy Cookies?</h2>

    <p>Cowboy cookies are a classic American treat, known for their hearty and robust ingredients. Traditionally, they include oats, chocolate chips, nuts, and coconut, making them a chewy, crunchy, and sweet delight. The name "cowboy cookie" is said to originate from the idea that these cookies were sturdy enough to withstand the rough and tumble life of a cowboy, making them a perfect snack for long journeys or outdoor adventures.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cowboy Cookies</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular oats instead of gluten-free oats?</h3>
        <p>While oats are naturally gluten-free, they are often processed in facilities that handle wheat, which can lead to cross-contamination. To ensure your cookies are truly gluten-free, it's best to use certified gluten-free oats.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I substitute the nuts in the recipe?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! If you have a nut allergy or simply prefer a different texture, you can substitute the nuts with seeds like sunflower or pumpkin seeds, or simply omit them altogether.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store gluten-free cowboy cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 3 months. Just make sure to thaw them at room temperature before serving.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make vegan gluten-free cowboy cookies by substituting the butter with a plant-based alternative (like coconut oil or vegan margarine) and using a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water) instead of regular eggs.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free cowboy cookies are a delightful treat that combines the best of both worlds: indulgence and health. With their rich flavors and satisfying textures, these cookies are perfect for anyone looking to enjoy a sweet snack without the guilt. Whether you're gluten-intolerant or simply exploring healthier dessert options, this recipe is a must-try.
