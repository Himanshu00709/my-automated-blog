    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free candy cane cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven</strong> to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients</strong>: In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the butter and sugar</strong>: In a large bowl, beat the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the wet ingredients</strong>: Beat in the egg, vanilla extract, and peppermint extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the mixtures</strong>: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Divide the dough</strong>: Split the dough into two equal portions. Add a few drops of red food coloring to one portion and mix until the color is evenly distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the cookies</strong>: Take small pieces of each dough and roll them into ropes. Twist the red and white ropes together and bend the top to form a candy cane shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong>: Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Decorate</strong>: While the cookies are still warm, sprinkle them with crushed candy canes for an extra festive touch.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Candy Cane Cookies</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to ensure your cookies turn out perfectly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend</strong>: Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the dough</strong>: Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the dough if necessary</strong>: If the dough is too soft to shape, chill it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before shaping.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors</strong>: If you’re not a fan of peppermint, try using almond extract or another flavoring of your choice.</li>
    </ul>
