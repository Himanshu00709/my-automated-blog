    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Apple Mixture</h3>
    <p>Start by peeling and dicing the apples into small pieces. In a small bowl, mix the diced apples with brown sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon. Set this mixture aside to allow the flavors to meld while you prepare the bread batter.</p>

    <h3>2. Make the Bread Batter</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Gradually mix in the dry ingredients, alternating with the Greek yogurt, until a smooth batter forms.</p>

    <h3>3. Layer the Batter and Apple Mixture</h3>
    <p>Pour half of the batter into a greased loaf pan. Spread half of the apple mixture evenly over the batter. Add the remaining batter on top, followed by the rest of the apple mixture. Use a knife to gently swirl the apples into the batter for a marbled effect.</p>

    <h3>4. Bake to Perfection</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and bake the bread for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>5. Add the Glaze</h3>
    <p>Once the bread has cooled, prepare the glaze by whisking together powdered sugar and milk until smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the top of the bread, allowing it to drip down the sides. Slice and serve your gluten-free apple fritter bread warm or at room temperature.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> Not all gluten-free flour blends are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix:</strong> Overmixing the batter can lead to a dense bread. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Fresh Apples:</strong> Fresh, crisp apples like Granny Smith or Honeycrisp work best for this recipe, as they hold their shape during baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Sweetness:</strong> If you prefer a less sweet bread, you can reduce the amount of sugar in both the batter and the apple mixture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like almond flour or oat flour, but keep in mind that the texture and taste may vary. A gluten-free flour blend is recommended for the best results.</p>

        <h3>Can I make this bread dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with coconut oil or a dairy-free margarine, and use a dairy-free yogurt alternative. Just ensure that all substitutions are gluten-free as well.</p>

        <h3>How should I store the bread?</h3>
        <p>Store the bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or other fruits?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can customize the bread by adding chopped nuts like walnuts or pecans, or even other fruits like pears or berries. Just be mindful of the additional moisture that some fruits may add.</p>
    </div>
