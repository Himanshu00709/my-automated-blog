    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to create delicious gluten-free oat bran muffins:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free oat bran, gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well to ensure even distribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet ingredients:</strong> In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, applesauce, milk, honey or maple syrup, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Add optional ingredients:</strong> If you’re using any add-ins like nuts or dried fruit, fold them into the batter at this stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill muffin cups:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
