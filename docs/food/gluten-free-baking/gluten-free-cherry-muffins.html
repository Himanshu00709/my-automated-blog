    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let's dive into the baking process. Follow these steps to create perfect gluten-free cherry muffins:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat your oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it lightly to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the wet ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, melted butter (or coconut oil), and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine wet and dry ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense muffins.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the cherries:</strong> Gently fold the chopped cherries into the batter. If you're using frozen cherries, make sure they're well-drained to avoid excess moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the muffin tin:</strong> Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full. This allows room for the muffins to rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 18-22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and serve:</strong> Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cherry Muffins</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free muffins can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you'll be able to achieve perfect results every time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a good gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough, dense muffins. Mix until just combined for a light, fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the sweetness:</strong> If you prefer less sweet muffins, you can reduce the amount of sugar or use a natural sweetener like honey or maple syrup.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with add-ins:</strong> While cherries are the star of this recipe, you can also add other ingredients like nuts, chocolate chips, or even a hint of almond extract for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>
