    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Follow these simple steps to create your gluten-free applesauce cookies:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, mix the unsweetened applesauce, melted coconut oil, maple syrup (or honey), and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until a dough forms. If you're using any add-ins, fold them into the dough at this stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and Shape:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or a spoon, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Flatten each cookie slightly with the back of a spoon or your fingers.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake, as the cookies will continue to firm up as they cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free applesauce cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</li>
