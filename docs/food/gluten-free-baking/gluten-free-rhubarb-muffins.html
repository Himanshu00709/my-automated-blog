<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

<p>Now that you have all the ingredients ready, let's move on to the step-by-step process of making gluten-free rhubarb muffins.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
<p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners or grease it with a little coconut oil to prevent sticking.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Ensure that the ingredients are well combined to avoid any lumps.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Combine Wet Ingredients</h3>
<p>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and then add the milk, honey (or maple syrup), melted coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Mix until the wet ingredients are well incorporated.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
<p>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense muffins.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Fold in Rhubarb</h3>
<p>Gently fold the chopped rhubarb into the batter. If you like, you can also add other mix-ins like nuts or seeds at this stage.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Fill Muffin Tin</h3>
<p>Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about two-thirds full. This allows room for the muffins to rise.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Bake</h3>
<p>Bake the muffins in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. The tops should be golden brown.</p>

<h3>Step 8: Cool and Serve</h3>
<p>Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Rhubarb Muffins</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use frozen rhubarb?</h3>
    <p>Yes, frozen rhubarb works just as well as fresh. Just make sure to thaw and drain it before adding it to the batter to avoid excess moisture.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I substitute the honey with another sweetener?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can use maple syrup, agave nectar, or even a sugar substitute like stevia. Just adjust the quantity to taste.</p>

    <h3>3. How should I store these muffins?</h3>
    <p>Store the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I make these muffins vegan?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make these muffins vegan by using a flax egg (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water) instead of regular eggs and a non-dairy milk.</p>
