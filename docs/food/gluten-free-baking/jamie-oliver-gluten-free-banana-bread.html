    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's walk through the steps to make Jamie Oliver's gluten-free banana bread:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a loaf pan with a little coconut oil or line it with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mash the Bananas</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until smooth. The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more flavorful your bread will be.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Add the eggs, melted coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract to the mashed bananas. Whisk everything together until well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, combine the almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense loaf.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fold in Optional Add-Ins</h3>
    <p>If you're using walnuts or chocolate chips, fold them into the batter at this stage. These add-ins will give your banana bread an extra layer of flavor and texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Banana Bread</h3>
    <p>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Allow the banana bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve as desired.</p>
