<h1>Gluten-Free Pizza Crust Nutrition Facts: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Gluten-free diets have gained immense popularity over the years, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among health-conscious individuals seeking alternative dietary options. One of the most beloved foods that has undergone a gluten-free transformation is pizza. Gluten-free pizza crusts are now widely available, but how do they stack up nutritionally? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the nutrition facts of gluten-free pizza crusts, exploring their ingredients, health benefits, and potential drawbacks.</p>

<h2>What is Gluten-Free Pizza Crust Made Of?</h2>

<p>Gluten-free pizza crusts are typically made from a blend of gluten-free flours and starches. Common ingredients include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Rice Flour:</strong> A staple in gluten-free baking, rice flour provides a light texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Almond Flour:</strong> Rich in protein and healthy fats, almond flour adds a nutty flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Coconut Flour:</strong> High in fiber and low in carbohydrates, coconut flour is a popular choice for low-carb diets.</li>
    <li><strong>Tapioca Starch:</strong> Used to improve elasticity and mimic the chewiness of traditional pizza crust.</li>
    <li><strong>Potato Starch:</strong> Adds moisture and helps bind the ingredients together.</li>
    <li><strong>Xanthan Gum:</strong> A common gluten substitute that helps improve the texture and structure of the crust.</li>
</ul>

<p>These ingredients are combined to create a dough that can be rolled out, baked, and topped just like traditional pizza crust. However, the nutritional profile of gluten-free pizza crusts can vary significantly depending on the ingredients used.</p>
