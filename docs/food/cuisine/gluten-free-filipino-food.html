    <h1>Gluten-Free Filipino Food: A Culinary Adventure</h1>
    <p>Filipino cuisine is a vibrant tapestry of flavors, influenced by centuries of trade, colonization, and local innovation. From the tangy sinigang to the savory adobo, Filipino dishes are beloved worldwide.

In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free Filipino food, offering tips, recipes, and insights to help you enjoy this delicious cuisine without worry.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten in Filipino Cuisine</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It’s commonly present in bread, pasta, and baked goods, but it can also hide in sauces, marinades, and processed foods. In Filipino cooking, soy sauce (toyo) is a primary source of gluten, as it’s made from fermented wheat. Other potential gluten-containing ingredients include oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, and certain types of vinegar. However, many Filipino dishes are naturally gluten-free, relying on rice, coconut, and fresh ingredients.</p>
