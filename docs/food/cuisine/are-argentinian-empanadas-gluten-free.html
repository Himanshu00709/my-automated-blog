<h2>Tips for Making Gluten-Free Empanadas</h2>

<p>Making gluten-free empanadas requires some adjustments to the traditional recipe. Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free empanadas turn out delicious:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a Binding Agent:</strong> Gluten-free flours lack the elasticity of wheat flour, so adding a binding agent like xanthan gum or psyllium husk can help hold the dough together.</li>
    <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Gluten-free dough can be more delicate, so chilling it before rolling it out can make it easier to handle.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Ratios:</strong> Different gluten-free flours absorb moisture differently, so you may need to adjust the amount of liquid in your recipe.</li>
    <li><strong>Prevent Cross-Contamination:</strong> If you’re preparing gluten-free empanadas in a kitchen that also handles gluten, be sure to clean all surfaces and utensils thoroughly to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
</ul>
