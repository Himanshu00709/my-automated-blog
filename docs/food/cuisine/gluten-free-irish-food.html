    <h2>Traditional Irish Dishes and Their Gluten-Free Adaptations</h2>

    <h3>1. Irish Stew</h3>

To make a gluten-free Irish stew, simply use a certified gluten-free broth and avoid thickening agents like flour. The result is a hearty, comforting meal that’s perfect for a chilly evening.</p>

    <h3>2. Colcannon</h3>
    <p>Colcannon is a traditional Irish dish made from mashed potatoes mixed with kale or cabbage, butter, and milk. This dish is naturally gluten-free, but it’s important to check the ingredients of any pre-packaged butter or milk to ensure they haven’t been cross-contaminated with gluten. For a richer flavor, consider adding gluten-free bacon or scallions to the mix.</p>

    <h3>3. Boxty</h3>
    <p>Boxty, a traditional Irish potato pancake, is typically made with grated potatoes, flour, and buttermilk. To make a gluten-free version, simply replace the wheat flour with a gluten-free flour blend, such as rice flour or almond flour.
