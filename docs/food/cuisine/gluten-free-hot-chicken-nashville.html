    <h1>Gluten-Free Hot Chicken Nashville: A Spicy Delight for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Nashville Hot Chicken has taken the culinary world by storm, with its fiery flavor and crispy texture. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this Southern delicacy can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free hot chicken Nashville—a dish that retains all the bold flavors of the original while being safe for gluten-free diets.

Whether you're a seasoned foodie or someone new to the gluten-free lifestyle, this guide will leave you craving a plate of spicy, crispy goodness.</p>

    <h2>The History of Nashville Hot Chicken</h2>
    <p>Nashville Hot Chicken has a rich history that dates back to the 1930s. Legend has it that the dish was created as a form of revenge. A man named Thornton Prince, known for his womanizing ways, came home late one night after a rendezvous. His girlfriend, seeking retribution, decided to make his fried chicken as spicy as possible. To her surprise, Thornton loved the fiery dish and even began selling it at his restaurant, Prince’s Hot Chicken Shack. Today, Nashville Hot Chicken is a staple of Southern cuisine, known for its crispy exterior and spicy, cayenne-infused glaze.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Nashville Hot Chicken Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Traditional Nashville Hot Chicken is coated in a flour-based batter before being fried, which contains gluten. To make it gluten-free, chefs substitute the wheat flour with gluten-free alternatives such as rice flour, cornstarch, or a blend of gluten-free flours. The chicken is then fried in oil that hasn’t been contaminated with gluten-containing foods. The spicy glaze, typically made with cayenne pepper, paprika, and other spices, is naturally gluten-free, making it easy to adapt the dish for those with dietary restrictions.</p>
