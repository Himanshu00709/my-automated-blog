<h2>How to Prepare Frozen Gluten-Free Soup Dumplings</h2>

<p>Preparing frozen gluten-free soup dumplings is a straightforward process that yields delicious results. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Steaming:</strong> Place the dumplings in a steamer basket lined with parchment paper or cabbage leaves to prevent sticking. Steam for 8-10 minutes until the wrappers are translucent and the filling is heated through.</li>
    <li><strong>Boiling:</strong> Bring a pot of water to a gentle boil. Add the dumplings and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Be careful not to overcook, as the wrappers may become too soft.</li>
    <li><strong>Pan-Frying:</strong> For a crispy texture, heat a bit of oil in a non-stick pan. Add the dumplings and cook until the bottoms are golden brown. Then, add a small amount of water to the pan, cover, and steam for an additional 3-4 minutes.</li>
