    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Needs</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to manage their health. Bruegger's recognizes this growing need and has introduced gluten-free options to cater to this audience.</p>

    <h2>Bruegger's Gluten-Free Menu</h2>

    <p>Bruegger's offers a variety of gluten-free items, including bagels, sandwiches, and salads. Here’s a breakdown of their gluten-free menu:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Item</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Calories</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>

    <h2>How Bruegger's Ensures Gluten-Free Safety</h2>

    <p>Bruegger's takes gluten-free preparation seriously. Here’s how they ensure the safety of their gluten-free offerings:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dedicated Preparation Areas:</strong> Gluten-free items are prepared in separate areas to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Separate Utensils:</strong> Special utensils are used exclusively for gluten-free items.</li>
        <li><strong>Staff Training:</strong> Employees are trained to handle gluten-free orders with care and attention to detail.</li>

However, they are a great option for those who need to avoid gluten. Here’s a quick comparison:</p>

    <table>

            <tr>
                <th>Item</th>
                <th>Calories</th>
                <th>Carbohydrates (g)</th>
                <th>Protein (g)</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>

                <td>Gluten-Free Bagel</td>
                <td>290-310</td>
                <td>60-65</td>
                <td>6-7</td>
            </tr>

                <td>Traditional Bagel</td>
                <td>250-280</td>
                <td>50-55</td>
