    <h1>Corner Bakery Gluten-Free Options: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the general preference for healthier eating habits. Corner Bakery Cafe, a popular chain known for its fresh, made-from-scratch meals, has responded to this demand by offering a variety of gluten-free options. Whether you're a long-time gluten-free eater or just exploring the lifestyle, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know about Corner Bakery's gluten-free offerings.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

    <p>Before diving into the specifics of Corner Bakery's gluten-free menu, it's essential to understand what a gluten-free diet entails. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. A gluten-free diet eliminates all foods containing gluten, which means avoiding traditional bread, pasta, cereals, and many processed foods.</p>

    <p>Corner Bakery has recognized the importance of catering to this dietary need, ensuring that their gluten-free options are not only safe but also delicious and satisfying. Let's explore what they have to offer.</p>
