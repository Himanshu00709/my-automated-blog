    <h1>Edgar's Bakery Gluten-Free: A Haven for Celiac and Gluten-Sensitive Individuals</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. For those who must avoid gluten, finding a bakery that offers delicious, safe, and high-quality gluten-free options can be a challenge.
