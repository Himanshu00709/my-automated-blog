    <h2>The Science Behind Gluten-Free Baking</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free baking is a science, and Martha's Country Bakery has mastered it. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, gives traditional baked goods their structure and elasticity. When baking gluten-free, bakers must find alternative ingredients that can replicate these properties. Martha's Country Bakery uses a blend of gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, rice flour, and tapioca starch, to achieve the perfect texture and flavor in their baked goods.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the bakery pays close attention to cross-contamination, ensuring that their gluten-free products are prepared in a separate area to avoid any contact with gluten-containing ingredients. This attention to detail is crucial for customers with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivities.</p>
