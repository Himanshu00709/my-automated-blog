    <h2>Preparing Gluten-Free Frozen Fish Fillets</h2>

    <p>Preparing gluten-free frozen fish fillets is straightforward and can be done in a variety of ways, depending on your preferences. Here are some popular methods:</p>

    <h3>Baking</h3>
    <p>Baking is one of the healthiest ways to cook gluten-free frozen fish fillets. Preheat your oven to 400째F (200째C), place the fillets on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and bake for 15-20 minutes or until the fish is flaky and cooked through. You can add a squeeze of lemon juice or a sprinkle of herbs for extra flavor.</p>

    <h3>Pan-Frying</h3>
    <p>For a crispy texture, pan-frying is an excellent option. Heat a small amount of oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the fillets and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Be sure to use a gluten-free oil, such as olive oil or avocado oil.</p>

    <h3>Grilling</h3>
    <p>Grilling is another great way to prepare gluten-free frozen fish fillets. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grates. Place the fillets on the grill and cook for 4-5 minutes on each side, or until the fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.</p>

    <h3>Air Frying</h3>
    <p>Air frying is a healthier alternative to deep frying and results in a crispy exterior with minimal oil. Preheat your air fryer to 375째F (190째C), place the fillets in the basket, and cook for 10-12 minutes, flipping halfway through.</p>
