    <h2>Tips for Baking Gluten-Free Italian Pastries</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free pastries requires a different approach than traditional baking. Here are some tips to help you achieve the best results:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a blend of gluten-free flours:</strong> Combining different types of gluten-free flours can help mimic the texture of wheat flour. A common blend includes almond flour, rice flour, and tapioca starch.</li>
        <li><strong>Add xanthan gum:</strong> Xanthan gum is a common ingredient in gluten-free baking that helps bind the dough and improve its elasticity.</li>

        <li><strong>Let the dough rest:</strong> Allowing the dough to rest before baking can help improve its texture and make it easier to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with flavors:</strong> Gluten-free pastries can be just as flavorful as traditional ones. Don’t be afraid to experiment with different flavors and fillings.</li>
    </ul>
