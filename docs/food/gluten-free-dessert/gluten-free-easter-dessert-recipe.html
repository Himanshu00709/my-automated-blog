<h2>FAQs</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of almond flour?</h3>
    <p>No, almond flour is a key ingredient in these recipes to keep them gluten-free. Regular flour contains gluten, which would defeat the purpose of these gluten-free desserts. If you have a nut allergy, you can try using sunflower seed flour or another gluten-free flour alternative.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I make these desserts ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, both the carrot cake and lemon bars can be made a day in advance. Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve. The carrot cake can also be frozen for up to a month.</p>

    <h3>3. Are these desserts suitable for vegans?</h3>
    <p>The recipes provided are not vegan as they contain eggs. However, you can experiment with egg substitutes like flax eggs or chia eggs to make them vegan-friendly. Keep in mind that the texture may vary slightly.</p>
