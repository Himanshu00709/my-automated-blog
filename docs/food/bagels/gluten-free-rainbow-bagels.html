    <h1>Gluten-Free Rainbow Bagels: A Colorful Twist on a Classic</h1>
    <p>Bagels have long been a beloved breakfast staple, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this chewy delight can be a challenge. Enter the gluten-free rainbow bagel—a vibrant, flavorful, and inclusive alternative that brings joy to everyone’s morning routine. In this article, we’ll explore the origins of rainbow bagels, the benefits of going gluten-free, and how you can make your own at home. Whether you’re a seasoned baker or a curious foodie, this guide will inspire you to add a splash of color to your plate.</p>

    <h2>The Rise of Rainbow Bagels</h2>
    <p>Rainbow bagels first gained popularity in Brooklyn, New York, where they were created by The Bagel Store. These eye-catching bagels are made by layering colorful dough to create a vibrant swirl of hues. While the original version contains gluten, the gluten-free adaptation has become a hit among those with dietary restrictions. The gluten-free rainbow bagel not only looks stunning but also offers a delicious and safe option for those avoiding gluten.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine. Others may have non-celiac gluten sensitivity, experiencing symptoms like bloating, fatigue, and headaches after eating gluten. Going gluten-free can improve digestion, boost energy levels, and reduce inflammation for these individuals. Additionally, gluten-free diets have gained popularity among health-conscious eaters, even those without gluten-related issues.</p>
