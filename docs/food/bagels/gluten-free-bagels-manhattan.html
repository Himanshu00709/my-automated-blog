    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Bagels</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Are gluten-free bagels healthier than regular bagels?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free bagels can be healthier for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, as they avoid the adverse effects of gluten. However, for those without gluten intolerance, gluten-free bagels may not necessarily be healthier, as they can sometimes be higher in sugar and fat to compensate for the lack of gluten.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I find gluten-free bagels at regular bakeries?</h3>
