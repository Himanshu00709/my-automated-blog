    <h1>Vegan Gluten-Free Bagels: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Bagels are a beloved breakfast staple, but for those following a vegan or gluten-free diet, finding the perfect bagel can be a challenge. Fortunately, the rise of plant-based and gluten-free diets has led to the creation of delicious vegan gluten-free bagels that cater to these dietary needs.
