<h1>Gluten-Free Greek Yogurt Bagels: A Healthy Twist on a Classic</h1>

<p>Bagels have long been a breakfast staple, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this classic treat can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free Greek yogurt bagels—a delicious, nutritious, and easy-to-make alternative that doesn’t compromise on taste or texture. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of gluten-free Greek yogurt bagels, how to make them, and why they’re a game-changer for anyone looking to enjoy a healthier version of this beloved bread.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Greek Yogurt Bagels?</h2>

<p>Greek yogurt is a key ingredient in these bagels, providing a rich source of protein, probiotics, and calcium. It also helps create a soft, chewy texture that mimics traditional bagels. Plus, the tangy flavor of Greek yogurt adds a unique twist that sets these bagels apart from other gluten-free options.</p>

<h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Greek Yogurt Bagels</h2>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>

    <li>Add the Greek yogurt to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms. The dough should be slightly sticky but manageable.</li>

    <li>In a small bowl, beat the egg and brush it over the top of each bagel. This will give them a golden, shiny finish.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle your choice of toppings (sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or everything bagel seasoning) over the egg-washed bagels.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the bagels are golden brown and firm to the touch.</li>
