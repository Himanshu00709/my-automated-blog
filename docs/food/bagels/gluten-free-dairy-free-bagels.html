    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Bagels at Home</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free dairy-free bagels at home is easier than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create your own delicious bagels:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>Start by mixing your gluten-free flour, xanthan gum, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, combine your non-dairy milk, egg replacer, and sweetener.

    <p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, carefully drop each bagel into the water and let them boil for about 1-2 minutes on each side. This step helps to give the bagels their characteristic chewy texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake the Bagels</h3>
    <p>After boiling, transfer the bagels back to the baking sheet. If desired, you can add toppings like sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or everything bagel seasoning. Bake the bagels in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown.</p>
