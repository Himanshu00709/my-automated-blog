    <h1>Gluten-Free Unagi Sauce: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Unagi sauce, a rich and savory glaze traditionally used in Japanese cuisine, is a staple for dishes like unagi don (grilled eel over rice) and sushi rolls. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying this flavorful sauce can be a challenge due to the presence of soy sauce, which typically contains gluten. Fortunately, gluten-free unagi sauce offers a delicious alternative without compromising on taste or authenticity. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free unagi sauce, from its ingredients and preparation to its health benefits and culinary uses.</p>

    <h2>What is Unagi Sauce?</h2>

    <p>Unagi sauce, also known as <em>nitsume</em>, is a thick, sweet, and savory glaze made from a combination of soy sauce, mirin (sweet rice wine), sugar, and sometimes sake. It is traditionally brushed over grilled eel (unagi) to enhance its flavor and create a glossy finish. The sauce’s umami-rich profile makes it a versatile condiment that pairs well with a variety of dishes, from sushi to grilled meats and vegetables.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues, inflammation, and other health complications. Traditional unagi sauce contains soy sauce, which is typically made from wheat and soybeans, making it unsuitable for a gluten-free diet. By opting for gluten-free unagi sauce, you can enjoy the same rich flavors without the adverse effects of gluten.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients in Gluten-Free Unagi Sauce</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free unagi sauce is made using gluten-free soy sauce or tamari, which is a Japanese soy sauce made without wheat. Here’s a breakdown of the key ingredients:</p>
