    <h1>Gluten-Free Chilli Sauce: A Spicy Delight for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Chilli sauce is a staple in many kitchens around the world, adding a fiery kick to dishes ranging from tacos to stir-fries. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free chilli sauce can be a challenge.

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Chilli Sauce?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free chilli sauce is a condiment made without any ingredients that contain gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause adverse reactions in people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Traditional chilli sauces often contain gluten as a thickening agent or in the form of soy sauce, which is commonly used in many recipes. However, gluten-free chilli sauces use alternative ingredients to achieve the same delicious flavor without the gluten.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Safe for Celiac Disease:</strong> Gluten-free chilli sauce is safe for individuals with celiac disease, as it does not contain any gluten proteins that can trigger an immune response.</li>
        <li><strong>Digestive Health:</strong> For those with gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten-free products can improve digestive health and reduce symptoms like bloating, gas, and diarrhea.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Gluten-free chilli sauce can be used in a variety of dishes, from marinades to dipping sauces, making it a versatile addition to any kitchen.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthier Option:</strong> Many gluten-free chilli sauces are made with natural ingredients, free from artificial additives and preservatives, making them a healthier choice.</li>
