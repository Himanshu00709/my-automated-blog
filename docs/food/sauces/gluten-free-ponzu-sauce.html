    <h1>Gluten-Free Ponzu Sauce: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Ponzu sauce is a versatile and flavorful condiment that has been a staple in Japanese cuisine for centuries. Traditionally made with a blend of citrus juice, rice vinegar, soy sauce, and mirin, it offers a unique balance of tangy, sweet, and savory flavors. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional ponzu sauce can be problematic due to the presence of soy sauce, which typically contains gluten. Enter gluten-free ponzu sauce—a delicious and safe alternative that allows everyone to enjoy this culinary delight. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free ponzu sauce, from its ingredients and benefits to how you can make it at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Ponzu Sauce?</h2>

    <p>Ponzu sauce is a Japanese condiment that combines the tangy zest of citrus fruits with the umami richness of soy sauce.

This sauce is often used as a dipping sauce for sashimi, tempura, and shabu-shabu, or as a marinade for meats and vegetables. Its bright, refreshing flavor makes it a favorite among chefs and home cooks alike.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
