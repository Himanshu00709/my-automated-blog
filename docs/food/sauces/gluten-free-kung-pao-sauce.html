    <h1>Gluten-Free Kung Pao Sauce: A Flavorful and Healthy Alternative</h1>

    <p>Kung Pao sauce is a staple in Chinese cuisine, known for its bold, spicy, and slightly sweet flavor profile. Traditionally, this sauce contains soy sauce, which often includes gluten. However, with the rise of gluten-free diets due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, there's a growing demand for gluten-free alternatives. In this article, we’ll explore how to make a delicious gluten-free Kung Pao sauce, its health benefits, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>
