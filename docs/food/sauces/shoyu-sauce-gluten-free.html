    <h1>Shoyu Sauce: A Gluten-Free Guide</h1>
    <p>Shoyu sauce, a staple in Japanese cuisine, is a type of soy sauce that has been enjoyed for centuries. Known for its rich, umami flavor, shoyu sauce is a versatile condiment used in marinades, dipping sauces, and cooking. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, traditional shoyu sauce can be problematic due to its wheat content. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free shoyu sauce, its benefits, and how to incorporate it into your diet.</p>

    <h2>What is Shoyu Sauce?</h2>
    <p>Shoyu sauce is a traditional Japanese soy sauce made from fermented soybeans, wheat, salt, and water. The fermentation process, which can take several months, gives shoyu its distinctive flavor and aroma. Unlike other types of soy sauce, shoyu typically contains wheat, which contributes to its unique taste and texture. However, this also means that traditional shoyu sauce is not gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free with Shoyu Sauce?</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and skin problems. Gluten-free shoyu sauce offers a safe alternative, allowing those with dietary restrictions to enjoy the rich flavors of traditional Japanese cuisine without the adverse effects of gluten.</p>

    <h2>How is Gluten-Free Shoyu Sauce Made?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free shoyu sauce is made using the same traditional fermentation process as regular shoyu, but with one key difference: the wheat is replaced with gluten-free grains such as rice or millet. This substitution ensures that the final product is free from gluten while still maintaining the complex flavors and umami characteristics of traditional shoyu sauce.</p>

        <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> It can be used in a variety of dishes, from sushi to stir-fries, just like regular shoyu sauce.</li>
