    <h1>Tofu Gluten: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Tofu gluten, often referred to as "wheat meat" or "seitan," is a versatile and protein-rich food that has gained popularity among vegetarians, vegans, and health-conscious individuals.

The term "tofu gluten" is sometimes used interchangeably with "seitan," although seitan typically refers to the seasoned and cooked form of wheat gluten.</p>
