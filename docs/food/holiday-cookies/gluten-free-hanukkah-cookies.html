    <p>Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights, is a time for family, tradition, and of course, delicious food. For those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying traditional Hanukkah treats can sometimes be a challenge. However, with a little creativity and the right ingredients, you can create gluten-free Hanukkah cookies that are just as festive and delicious as their traditional counterparts. In this blog post, we'll explore the world of gluten-free Hanukkah cookies, from classic recipes to modern twists, and provide you with all the information you need to make your holiday season both joyful and gluten-free.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Hanukkah Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular in recent years, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference. For those who need to avoid gluten, finding suitable holiday treats can be difficult, especially when it comes to traditional baked goods. Hanukkah cookies, often made with wheat flour, can be a particular challenge. However, with the rise of gluten-free baking, there are now many alternatives that allow everyone to enjoy these festive treats without compromising on taste or texture.</p>

    <h2>Classic Gluten-Free Hanukkah Cookie Recipes</h2>
    <p>When it comes to Hanukkah cookies, there are a few classics that come to mind. Here are some traditional recipes adapted to be gluten-free:</p>

    <h3>1. Gluten-Free Rugelach</h3>
    <p>Rugelach is a beloved Jewish pastry that is often enjoyed during Hanukkah. Traditionally made with a cream cheese dough, rugelach can easily be made gluten-free by using a blend of gluten-free flours. Here's a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Ingredient</th>
            <th>Quantity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Gluten-free flour blend</td>
            <td>2 cups</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cream cheese</td>
            <td>8 oz</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Unsalted butter</td>
            <td>1 cup</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sugar</td>
            <td>1/4 cup</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Filling (jam, chocolate, nuts, etc.)</td>
            <td>As needed</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>To make the dough, combine the gluten-free flour, cream cheese, butter, and sugar in a food processor until a dough forms. Roll out the dough, spread your chosen filling, and roll it up into crescent shapes. Bake at 350Â°F for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.</p>

    <h3>2. Gluten-Free Sufganiyot (Jelly Donuts)</h3>
    <p>Sufganiyot, or jelly-filled donuts, are a Hanukkah staple. While traditional sufganiyot are made with wheat flour, you can create a gluten-free version using a gluten-free flour blend. Here's a basic recipe:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Ingredient</th>
            <th>Quantity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Gluten-free flour blend</td>
            <td>2 cups</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Yeast</td>
            <td>1 packet</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Warm water</td>
            <td>1/2 cup</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sugar</td>
            <td>1/4 cup</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Egg</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Jelly or jam for filling</td>
            <td>As needed</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, sugar, and egg. Add the yeast mixture and mix until a dough forms. Let the dough rise for 1 hour, then roll it out and cut into circles. Fill each circle with jelly, seal the edges, and fry in hot oil until golden brown. Dust with powdered sugar before serving.</p>
