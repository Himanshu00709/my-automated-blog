    <h2>Classic Gluten-Free Hanukkah Cookie Recipes</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into some classic gluten-free Hanukkah cookie recipes that will delight your family and friends.</p>

    <h3>1. Gluten-Free Rugelach</h3>

    <p>Rugelach is a traditional Jewish pastry that’s often enjoyed during Hanukkah. To make a gluten-free version, you’ll need a gluten-free flour blend, cream cheese, and your favorite fillings like jam, chocolate, or nuts. The key to perfect rugelach is rolling the dough thinly and spreading the filling evenly. Once baked, these cookies are flaky, sweet, and utterly irresistible.</p>

    <h3>2. Gluten-Free Sufganiyot (Donut Cookies)</h3>

    <p>Sufganiyot, or jelly-filled donuts, are a Hanukkah staple. While traditional sufganiyot are deep-fried, you can make a gluten-free cookie version that’s baked instead. Use a gluten-free flour blend and fill the cookies with your favorite jam or custard. Dust them with powdered sugar for a festive touch.</p>

    <h3>3. Gluten-Free Star of David Cookies</h3>

    <p>These cookies are shaped like the Star of David, a symbol of Hanukkah. Use a gluten-free sugar cookie dough and cut out the stars using a cookie cutter. Decorate with royal icing or sprinkles to make them extra special. These cookies are not only delicious but also a beautiful addition to your Hanukkah table.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Hanukkah Cookies</h2>

    <p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be well on your way to success:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Measure Accurately:</strong> Gluten-free flours can be denser than regular flour, so it’s important to measure your ingredients accurately. Use a kitchen scale for best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Gluten-free dough can be stickier than regular dough, so chilling it before baking will make it easier to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix the dough just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Parchment Paper:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can be more delicate, so using parchment paper will prevent them from sticking to the baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Gluten-free baking is a great opportunity to experiment with different flavors and textures. Try adding spices like cinnamon or cardamom, or mix in nuts and dried fruits for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>No, if you’re making gluten-free cookies, you must use gluten-free flour. Regular flour contains gluten, which is not suitable for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

        <h3>2. Are gluten-free cookies healthier?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cookies can be healthier for those who need to avoid gluten, but they can still be high in sugar and fat. It’s important to enjoy them in moderation as part of a balanced diet.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I freeze gluten-free cookie dough?</h3>
        <p>Yes, gluten-free cookie dough can be frozen. Shape the dough into balls or logs, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap, and store them in the freezer for up to three months. When you’re ready to bake, simply thaw the dough and bake as usual.</p>

        <h3>4. What’s the best gluten-free flour blend for cookies?</h3>
