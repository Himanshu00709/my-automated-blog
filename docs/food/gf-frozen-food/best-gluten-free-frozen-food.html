        <h3>3. How do I store gluten-free frozen foods?</h3>
        <p>Store gluten-free frozen foods in the freezer at 0°F (-18°C) or below. Keep them in their original packaging or transfer them to airtight containers to prevent freezer burn. Always follow the storage instructions on the packaging for best results.</p>
