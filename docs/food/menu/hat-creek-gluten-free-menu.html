    <h2>Nutritional Considerations</h2>

    <p>While Hat Creek’s gluten-free menu is designed to be safe for those with gluten sensitivities, it’s important to consider the nutritional aspects of your meal. Gluten-free doesn’t always mean low-calorie or low-fat, so it’s essential to make informed choices based on your dietary needs.</p>

    <p>For example, the Classic Burger on a gluten-free bun contains approximately 500 calories, while the Bacon Cheeseburger can range closer to 700 calories. Pairing your burger with a side of fries adds an additional 300-400 calories, depending on the portion size. If you’re looking for a lighter option, consider the Sweet Potato Fries, which are lower in calories and higher in nutrients like vitamin A.</p>
