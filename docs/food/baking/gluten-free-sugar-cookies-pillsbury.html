    <p>Baking Pillsbury's Gluten-Free Sugar Cookies is a straightforward process that even novice bakers can master. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you bake the perfect batch:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Remove the dough from the packaging and place it on a lightly floured surface. If the dough is too sticky, you can add a small amount of gluten-free flour to make it easier to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Cookies:</strong> Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to your desired thickness. Then, use cookie cutters to cut out shapes or simply slice the dough into rounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can decorate them with icing or enjoy them as is.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Serving and Storing</h2>

    <p>Once your cookies are baked and cooled, there are several ways to serve and store them to ensure they stay fresh and delicious:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Serving:</strong> These cookies are perfect for any occasion, from holiday parties to afternoon snacks. You can serve them plain or decorate them with gluten-free icing and sprinkles for a festive touch.</li>
        <li><strong>Storing:</strong> To keep your cookies fresh, store them in an airtight container at room temperature. They will stay fresh for up to a week. If you want to keep them longer, you can freeze the cookies in a freezer-safe container for up to three months.</li>
