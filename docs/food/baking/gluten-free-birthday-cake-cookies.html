    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making these delightful cookies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Egg and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Milk and Sprinkles:</strong> Stir in the almond milk and sprinkles until the dough comes together. The sprinkles will give your cookies that festive birthday cake look.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and Bake:</strong> Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your gluten-free birthday cake cookies!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Birthday Cake Cookies</h2>
    <p>To ensure your cookies turn out perfectly every time, here are some additional tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the texture of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix until just combined for the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If your dough is too sticky, chilling it for 30 minutes can make it easier to handle.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Sprinkles:</strong> Use different colors and shapes of sprinkles to match the theme of your celebration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Birthday Cake Cookies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>No, using regular flour will not make these cookies gluten-free. If you’re baking for someone with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, it’s essential to use a gluten-free flour blend.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or vegan butter, and use a non-dairy milk like almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>How should I store these cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 2 months.</p>

        <h3>Can I add other mix-ins?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Feel free to add chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruit to the dough for extra flavor and texture.</p>
