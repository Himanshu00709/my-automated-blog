    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Slice and Bake Cookies</h2>

    <p>Now that you know the essential ingredients, let’s dive into a simple and delicious recipe for gluten-free slice and bake cookies. This recipe is easy to follow and yields perfectly crisp and chewy cookies every time.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter (or coconut oil for a vegan option)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg (or flax egg for a vegan option)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Optional mix-ins: chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruits</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Mix-Ins:</strong> If using mix-ins like chocolate chips or nuts, fold them into the dough at this stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Divide the dough into two equal portions. Roll each portion into a log, about 1.5 inches in diameter. Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until firm.</li>
        <li><strong>Slice and Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Remove the dough logs from the refrigerator and slice them into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Place the rounds on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Slice and Bake Cookies</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free slice and bake cookies turn out perfectly every time, keep these tips in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> Chilling the dough is crucial for slice and bake cookies. It helps the dough hold its shape and prevents the cookies from spreading too much during baking.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Sharp Knife:</strong> When slicing the dough, use a sharp knife to get clean, even slices. This will help the cookies bake evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Don’t be afraid to experiment with different flavors and mix-ins. Try adding spices like cinnamon or nutmeg, or mix in different types of chocolate or dried fruits.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> If you’re not baking all the cookies at once, you can store the dough logs in the refrigerator for up to a week or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Just slice and bake as needed.</li>
    </ul>
