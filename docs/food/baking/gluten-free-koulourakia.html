    <h1>Gluten-Free Koulourakia: A Delicious Twist on a Greek Classic</h1>

    <p>Koulourakia, the traditional Greek butter cookies, are a staple in Greek households, especially during Easter and other festive occasions. These delightful, twisted cookies are known for their buttery flavor and slightly crunchy texture. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying these treats can be a challenge. Enter gluten-free koulourakia—a delicious and inclusive alternative that allows everyone to savor this beloved Greek delicacy.</p>

    <h2>What Are Koulourakia?</h2>

    <p>Koulourakia are traditional Greek cookies that are typically made with flour, butter, sugar, eggs, and a touch of vanilla or orange zest. They are often shaped into twists, braids, or circles and are sometimes topped with sesame seeds. These cookies are a symbol of hospitality and are often served with coffee or tea. The name "koulourakia" comes from the Greek word "kouloura," which means "circle" or "ring," reflecting their traditional shape.</p>

    <h2>The Rise of Gluten-Free Koulourakia</h2>

    <p>With the increasing awareness of gluten-related disorders, such as celiac disease and gluten sensitivity, there has been a growing demand for gluten-free versions of traditional recipes. Gluten-free koulourakia are made using alternative flours, such as almond flour, rice flour, or a gluten-free flour blend, to replace the traditional wheat flour. This substitution not only makes the cookies safe for those with gluten intolerance but also adds a unique flavor and texture to the cookies.</p>

    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Koulourakia</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free koulourakia is a straightforward process that involves a few simple steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Eggs and Flavorings:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract and orange zest.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, almond flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Cookies:</strong> Take small portions of the dough and roll them into ropes. Twist the ropes into your desired shapes (circles, braids, or twists) and place them on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Toppings (Optional):</strong> If desired, brush the cookies with a beaten egg and sprinkle sesame seeds on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the cookies for 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Allow them to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Koulourakia</h2>

    <p>To ensure your gluten-free koulourakia turn out perfectly, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that is specifically designed for baking to achieve the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to tough cookies. Mix the dough just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If the dough is too sticky to handle, chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before shaping the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> While traditional koulourakia are flavored with vanilla and orange zest, feel free to experiment with other flavors, such as lemon zest, almond extract, or even a touch of cinnamon.</li>
    </ul>
