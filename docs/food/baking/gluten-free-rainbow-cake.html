    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <h3>1. Preparing the Batter</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, and mix until just combined.</p>

    <h3>2. Dividing and Coloring the Batter</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter evenly into six separate bowls. Add a few drops of gel-based food coloring to each bowl, mixing until you achieve vibrant colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. Gel-based food coloring works best as it provides intense colors without altering the batter’s consistency.</p>

    <h3>3. Baking the Layers</h3>
    <p>Grease and line six 8-inch round cake pans with parchment paper. Pour each colored batter into a separate pan, spreading it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>4. Assembling the Cake</h3>
    <p>Once the cakes are completely cool, it’s time to assemble your rainbow cake. Place the purple layer on a serving plate and spread a thin layer of frosting on top. Repeat with the blue, green, yellow, orange, and red layers, stacking them in that order. Frost the entire cake with a generous layer of frosting, smoothing it out with a spatula. For a more dramatic effect, you can also frost between each layer with a different color of frosting.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Rainbow Cake</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a reliable gluten-free flour blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Choose a blend that is specifically designed for baking cakes to ensure the best texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix until the ingredients are just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Use gel-based food coloring:</strong> Gel-based colors are more concentrated and won’t thin out your batter like liquid food coloring.</li>
        <li><strong>Allow the cakes to cool completely:</strong> Assembling the cake with warm layers can cause the frosting to melt and slide off.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can easily make this cake dairy-free by substituting the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine, and using a dairy-free milk such as almond or oat milk.</p>

        <h3>Can I use natural food coloring?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Natural food coloring can be used, but keep in mind that the colors may not be as vibrant as those achieved with gel-based food coloring. You can use ingredients like beet juice for red, turmeric for yellow, and spinach for green.</p>

        <h3>How do I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. If refrigerated, allow the cake to come to room temperature before serving for the best texture.</p>
