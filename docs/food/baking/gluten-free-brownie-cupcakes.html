    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>

    <p>Now that you have all your ingredients ready, let's dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free brownie cupcakes:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with cupcake liners. This will ensure that your brownie cupcakes don't stick to the pan and are easy to remove once baked.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these ingredients together until well combined. This ensures that the dry ingredients are evenly distributed, which is crucial for achieving a consistent texture in your cupcakes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, melted coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. Make sure the coconut oil is not too hot, as it could cook the eggs. Once the wet ingredients are well combined, pour them into the dry ingredients.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Mix the Batter</h3>
    <p>Gently fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can lead to dense cupcakes. If you're using dark chocolate chips, fold them into the batter at this stage.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Fill the Cupcake Liners</h3>
    <p>Using a spoon or an ice cream scoop, fill each cupcake liner about two-thirds full with the batter. This allows room for the cupcakes to rise without overflowing.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Cupcakes</h3>
    <p>Place the muffin tin in the preheated oven and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Keep an eye on them, as baking times may vary depending on your oven.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once baked, remove the cupcakes from the oven and let them cool in the tin for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve them as is or with a dollop of whipped cream or a drizzle of chocolate sauce for an extra treat.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Brownie Cupcakes</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with other gluten-free flours like oat flour or rice flour. However, keep in mind that different flours have different absorption rates, so you may need to adjust the quantity of wet ingredients accordingly.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make these cupcakes vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can replace the eggs with flax eggs (1 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tbsp water per egg) and use a plant-based sweetener like agave syrup instead of maple syrup.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store gluten-free brownie cupcakes?</h3>
        <p>Store the cupcakes in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can refrigerate them for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I add nuts or other mix-ins?</h3>
        <p>Yes, feel free to add chopped nuts, dried fruit, or even a swirl of peanut butter to the batter for added texture and flavor.</p>
