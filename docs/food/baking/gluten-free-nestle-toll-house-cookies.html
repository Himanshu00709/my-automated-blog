    <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Making gluten-free Nestle Toll House cookies is similar to the traditional recipe, with a few adjustments to ensure the best results. Follow these steps:</p>

    <h3>1. Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly and achieve the perfect texture.</p>

    <h3>2. Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking soda, and salt. This helps to evenly distribute the leavening agent and salt throughout the dough.</p>

    <h3>3. Cream Butter and Sugars</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for creating a soft and chewy cookie.</p>

    <h3>4. Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Make sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.</p>

    <h3>5. Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Overmixing can lead to tough cookies, so be careful not to overdo it.</p>

    <h3>6. Fold in Chocolate Chips</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the gluten-free chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</p>

    <h3>7. Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may look slightly underbaked, but they will firm up as they cool.</p>

    <h3>8. Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your gluten-free Nestle Toll House cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</p>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Cookies</h2>
    <p>Baking gluten-free cookies can be a bit tricky, but with these tips, you’ll be able to achieve the perfect texture and flavor:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a High-Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing can lead to dense and tough cookies. Mix until just combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the Dough:</strong> If your dough is too soft, chilling it for 30 minutes before baking can help prevent spreading.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to add nuts, dried fruit, or other mix-ins to customize your cookies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use almond flour instead of a gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Almond flour can be used, but it will result in a denser and more crumbly cookie. For a texture closer to traditional Toll House cookies, a gluten-free flour blend is recommended.</p>

        <h3>How do I store gluten-free cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store your gluten-free cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. You can also freeze the dough or baked cookies for longer storage.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies dairy-free as well?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like coconut oil or margarine. Just ensure that your chocolate chips are also dairy-free.</p>

        <h3>Why do my gluten-free cookies spread too much?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free cookies can spread more if the dough is too warm or if there’s too much fat in the recipe. Chilling the dough before baking can help reduce spreading.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free Nestle Toll House cookies are a delicious treat that everyone can enjoy, regardless of dietary restrictions. By using the right ingredients and following the steps outlined above, you can create cookies that are just as tasty as the original. Whether you’re new to gluten-free baking or a seasoned pro, these cookies are sure to become a favorite in your household. Happy baking!</p>
