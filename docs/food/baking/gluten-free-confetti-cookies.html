    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Confetti Cookies</h2>

    <p>Making gluten-free confetti cookies is a straightforward process that yields delicious results. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter (or dairy-free alternative) and sugar until light and fluffy. This step is crucial for achieving the right texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs (or egg substitute) one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Make sure everything is well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add this mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add the Sprinkles</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the confetti sprinkles. Be careful not to overmix, as this can cause the sprinkles to bleed their color into the dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your gluten-free confetti cookies!</p>
