<h1>Gluten-Free Italian Anise Cookies: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>

<p>Italian anise cookies, or "biscotti al anice," are a classic treat that has been enjoyed for generations. These soft, aromatic cookies are traditionally made with anise extract or seeds, giving them a distinct licorice-like flavor. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, enjoying these cookies can be a challenge. Fortunately, with a few simple substitutions, you can create gluten-free Italian anise cookies that are just as delicious as the original. In this article, we'll explore the history of these cookies, provide a detailed recipe, and answer some common questions about gluten-free baking.</p>

<h2>The History of Italian Anise Cookies</h2>

<p>Italian anise cookies have a rich history that dates back centuries. Originating in Italy, these cookies were often made during special occasions and holidays, such as Christmas and Easter. The use of anise, a spice that has been cultivated in the Mediterranean region for thousands of years, gives these cookies their unique flavor. Anise was highly valued in ancient times for its medicinal properties and was often used to aid digestion and freshen breath. Over time, the spice became a staple in Italian baking, leading to the creation of these beloved cookies.</p>

<p>Traditionally, Italian anise cookies are made with wheat flour, eggs, sugar, and anise extract or seeds. The dough is typically rolled into small balls or shaped into logs, then baked until golden brown. After baking, the cookies are often dipped in a simple glaze made from powdered sugar and milk, adding a sweet finish to the already flavorful treat.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Italian Anise Cookies: A Modern Twist</h2>

<p>For those who need to avoid gluten, traditional Italian anise cookies are off the menu. However, with the rise of gluten-free baking, it's now possible to enjoy these cookies without compromising on taste or texture. The key to making gluten-free Italian anise cookies is to use a high-quality gluten-free flour blend. Many gluten-free flours, such as almond flour, rice flour, or a pre-made gluten-free flour mix, can be used as a substitute for wheat flour. Additionally, xanthan gum is often added to gluten-free recipes to help mimic the elasticity and structure that gluten provides.</p>

<p>Below is a detailed recipe for gluten-free Italian anise cookies that will satisfy your cravings and impress your friends and family:</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, and salt.</li>
    <li>In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the anise extract.</li>
    <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add the milk one tablespoon at a time until the desired consistency is reached.</li>
    <li>Roll the dough into small balls (about 1 inch in diameter) and place them on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
    <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    <li>While the cookies are cooling, prepare the glaze by whisking together the powdered sugar and milk until smooth. Dip the top of each cookie into the glaze and place them back on the wire rack. Add sprinkles if desired, and allow the glaze to set before serving.</li>
