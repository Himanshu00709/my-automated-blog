    <h1>Gluten-Free Italian Anise Cookies: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>

    <p>Italian anise cookies, or "biscotti al anice," are a classic treat that has been enjoyed for generations. These soft, aromatic cookies are traditionally made with anise extract or seeds, giving them a distinct licorice-like flavor. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying these cookies can be a challenge. That's where gluten-free Italian anise cookies come in. In this blog post, we'll explore the history of these cookies, how to make them gluten-free, and why they're a must-try for anyone looking to enjoy a delicious, allergy-friendly treat.</p>

    <h2>The History of Italian Anise Cookies</h2>

    <p>Italian anise cookies have a rich history that dates back centuries. Originating in Italy, these cookies were often made during the holiday season and special occasions.

Today, these cookies are a staple in Italian-American households, often served at weddings, baptisms, and other celebrations.</p>

Fortunately, gluten-free baking has come a long way, allowing those with dietary restrictions to enjoy their favorite treats without compromising on taste or texture. Gluten-free Italian anise cookies are a perfect example of how traditional recipes can be adapted to meet modern dietary needs.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix dry ingredients:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream butter and sugar:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. However, keep in mind that different blends may yield slightly different textures. For best results, use a blend that includes xanthan gum, which helps mimic the elasticity of gluten.</p>

        <h3>Can I substitute the anise extract with something else?</h3>
        <p>If you're not a fan of anise, you can substitute it with other extracts like almond, vanilla, or lemon. However, keep in mind that this will change the traditional flavor of the cookies.</p>
