    <h2>Step-by-Step Baking Instructions</h2>

    <p>Baking gluten-free sprinkle cookies is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to achieve perfect cookies every time:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream the Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Egg and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the egg and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Sprinkles:</strong> Gently fold in the rainbow sprinkles until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoop and Bake:</strong> Use a cookie scoop or tablespoon to drop dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.</li>
