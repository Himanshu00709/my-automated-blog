    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Basque Cake</h2>
    <p>Making a gluten-free Basque cake is a straightforward process, but it requires attention to detail to ensure the best results. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond flour, tapioca flour, rice flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Assemble the Cake</h3>
    <p>Divide the dough into two equal portions. Press one portion into the bottom of a greased and floured cake pan. Spread the pastry cream or jam evenly over the dough. Roll out the second portion of dough and place it on top of the filling, sealing the edges. Use a knife to create a crosshatch pattern on the top of the cake.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Bake the cake for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
