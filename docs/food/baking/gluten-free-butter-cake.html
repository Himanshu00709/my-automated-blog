<h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Butter Cake</h2>

<p>Now that you know the key ingredients, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making a gluten-free butter cake. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure a perfect cake every time.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup milk (dairy or non-dairy)</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch round or square cake pan and line it with parchment paper.</li>
    <li><strong>Cream the Butter and Sugar:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes with an electric mixer.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the Eggs:</strong> Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Make sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternate Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Vanilla Extract:</strong> Stir in the vanilla extract until fully incorporated.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake the Cake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Serve as is or with your favorite frosting.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips for the Perfect Gluten-Free Butter Cake</h2>

<p>Making a gluten-free butter cake can be a bit tricky, especially if you’re new to gluten-free baking. Here are some tips to help you achieve the best results:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use a Quality Gluten-Free Flour Blend:</strong> Not all gluten-free flours are created equal. Look for a blend that is specifically designed for baking, as it will have the right balance of flours and starches to mimic the texture of wheat flour.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense and tough cake. Mix the batter just until the ingredients are combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Let the Cake Cool Completely:</strong> Gluten-free cakes can be more delicate than traditional cakes, so it’s important to let them cool completely before slicing or frosting.</li>
    <li><strong>Experiment with Flavors:</strong> Feel free to add your own twist to the cake by incorporating citrus zest, spices, or even chocolate chips.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Butter Cake</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use any gluten-free flour for this cake?</h3>
    <p>While you can use a variety of gluten-free flours, it’s best to use a pre-mixed gluten-free flour blend that is specifically designed for baking. These blends usually contain a mix of flours and starches that help mimic the texture of wheat flour.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I make this cake dairy-free as well?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can make this cake dairy-free by substituting the butter with a dairy-free alternative (such as coconut oil or vegan butter) and using a non-dairy milk (such as almond milk or oat milk).</p>

    <h3>3. How should I store the gluten-free butter cake?</h3>
    <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the cake for up to 3 months. Just make sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing.</p>

    <h3>4. Can I add frosting to the gluten-free butter cake?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! A simple buttercream frosting or cream cheese frosting pairs beautifully with this cake. Just make sure any additional ingredients you use are also gluten-free.</p>
