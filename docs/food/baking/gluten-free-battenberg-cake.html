    <h1>Gluten-Free Battenberg Cake: A Delightful Treat for Everyone</h1>
    <p>Battenberg cake is a classic British dessert known for its distinctive checkered pattern and almond flavor. Traditionally made with wheat flour, this cake has been a favorite for generations. However, with the rise of gluten intolerance and celiac disease, many people are seeking gluten-free alternatives to enjoy this beloved treat. In this blog post, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free Battenberg cake, from its history to a step-by-step recipe, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>The History of Battenberg Cake</h2>
    <p>The Battenberg cake was first created in the late 19th century to celebrate the marriage of Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine to Prince Louis of Battenberg. The cake’s unique design, featuring four squares of pink and yellow sponge, is said to represent the four Battenberg princes. Over the years, the cake has become a staple in British tea culture, and its gluten-free version has made it accessible to a wider audience.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and even long-term damage to the small intestine. A gluten-free diet is essential for these individuals, and gluten-free baking allows them to enjoy traditional treats like Battenberg cake without compromising their health.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F). Grease and line a Battenberg cake tin or a square baking tin with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and caster sugar until light and fluffy. Gradually add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the almond extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Divide and Color the Batter</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter equally into two separate bowls. In one bowl, add a few drops of pink food coloring and mix until the color is evenly distributed. Leave the other bowl of batter as it is.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Sponges</h3>
    <p>Spoon the pink batter into one half of the prepared tin and the plain batter into the other half. Smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the sponges to cool completely in the tin before removing.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Assemble the Cake</h3>
    <p>Once the sponges are cool, trim the edges to create two rectangular blocks of equal size. Cut each block lengthwise into two equal strips, so you have four strips in total—two pink and two plain. Brush the strips with warmed apricot jam and stick them together alternately to form the classic checkered pattern.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Wrap in Marzipan</h3>
    <p>Roll out the marzipan on a surface dusted with icing sugar to form a rectangle large enough to wrap around the cake. Brush the outside of the assembled cake with more apricot jam and carefully wrap it in the marzipan, pressing gently to seal the edges. Trim any excess marzipan and neaten the ends.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different gluten-free flour blend?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can use any gluten-free flour blend that you prefer. However, make sure it’s a 1:1 substitute for wheat flour to ensure the right texture.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative like margarine or coconut oil. Just ensure that the substitute is suitable for baking.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. If you need to store it longer, you can refrigerate it for up to a week.</p>
