    <h2>Step-by-Step Recipe for Gluten-Free Marshmallow Cookies</h2>
    <p>Now that we’ve covered the key ingredients, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making these delectable cookies.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will prevent the cookies from sticking and make cleanup a breeze.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together your gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. This ensures that the dry ingredients are evenly distributed, which is crucial for achieving the perfect cookie texture.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This step is essential for creating a soft and chewy cookie. If you’re using a liquid sweetener like honey or maple syrup, mix it in at this stage as well.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Add the Eggs and Vanilla</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by a teaspoon of vanilla extract. The eggs act as a binding agent, while the vanilla adds a subtle depth of flavor.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Overmixing can lead to tough cookies, so be gentle with your stirring.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Fold in the Marshmallows</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the gluten-free marshmallows. You can use mini marshmallows for even distribution or larger ones for a more gooey center. Be careful not to overmix, as this can cause the marshmallows to break apart.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Scoop and Bake</h3>
    <p>Using a cookie scoop or a tablespoon, drop rounded balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Leave enough space between each cookie to allow for spreading. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Cool and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your gluten-free marshmallow cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Marshmallow Cookies</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Are marshmallows naturally gluten-free?</h3>
        <p>Most marshmallows are naturally gluten-free, but it’s always important to check the label, as some brands may use gluten-containing ingredients or be processed in facilities that handle gluten.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Simply substitute the butter with a plant-based alternative and use flax eggs or chia eggs instead of regular eggs. Ensure that the marshmallows you use are also vegan, as traditional marshmallows contain gelatin.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I store gluten-free marshmallow cookies?</h3>
        <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, you can freeze the cookies for up to 3 months. Just be sure to let them thaw at room temperature before enjoying.</p>
