    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Gluten-Free White Chocolate Cake</h2>

    <p>Now that we’ve covered the key ingredients, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making this delectable cake:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat and Prepare</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line your cake pans with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Melt the White Chocolate</h3>
    <p>In a heatproof bowl, melt the white chocolate using a double boiler or microwave. Stir until smooth and set aside to cool slightly.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Ensure the ingredients are well combined.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with the milk. Mix until just combined. Fold in the melted white chocolate until the batter is smooth and uniform.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Bake the Cake</h3>
    <p>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Frost and Decorate</h3>
    <p>Once the cakes are completely cool, frost them with your favorite gluten-free frosting. White chocolate ganache, cream cheese frosting, or whipped cream are excellent choices. Decorate with fresh berries, edible flowers, or additional white chocolate shavings for an elegant finish.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free White Chocolate Cake</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Can I use regular flour instead of gluten-free flour?</h3>
        <p>No, using regular flour will introduce gluten into the cake, making it unsuitable for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Always use a certified gluten-free flour blend for the best results.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I make this cake dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make this cake dairy-free by using dairy-free white chocolate, plant-based butter, and non-dairy milk. Ensure all ingredients are labeled as dairy-free to avoid cross-contamination.</p>

        <h3>3. How should I store the cake?</h3>
        <p>Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or refrigerate for up to 5 days. If frosted with a perishable frosting like cream cheese, refrigeration is recommended.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I freeze the cake?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can freeze the cake for up to 3 months. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer-safe container. Thaw in the refrigerator before serving.</p>
    </div>
