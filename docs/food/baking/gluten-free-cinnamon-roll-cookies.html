<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. In a separate large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a soft dough forms.</p>

<h3>2. Make the Cinnamon Filling</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar and cinnamon. This will be the filling that gives your cookies that classic cinnamon roll flavor. Set aside.</p>

<h3>3. Assemble the Cookies</h3>
<p>Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over the dough. Carefully roll the dough into a log, starting from one of the longer sides. Slice the log into 1/2-inch thick rounds and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</p>

<h3>4. Bake the Cookies</h3>
<p>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

<h3>5. Prepare the Glaze</h3>
<p>While the cookies are cooling, prepare the glaze by whisking together the powdered sugar and milk until smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cookies, and let it set before serving.</p>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Cinnamon Roll Cookies</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Can I use a different type of gluten-free flour?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free flours, such as rice flour or coconut flour. However, keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary slightly.</p>

    <h3>2. How should I store these cookies?</h3>
    <p>Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, you can freeze them for up to 2 months.</p>

    <h3>3. Can I make these cookies dairy-free?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the butter with a dairy-free alternative, such as coconut oil or margarine, and use a non-dairy milk for the glaze.</p>

    <h3>4. Are these cookies suitable for people with nut allergies?</h3>
    <p>If you're using almond flour, these cookies may not be suitable for those with nut allergies. You can use a nut-free gluten-free flour blend instead.</p>
