    <h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <ol>

        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free brownie mix, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Stir until the ingredients are well combined and a thick dough forms.</li>
        <li>If desired, fold in the chocolate chips or any other add-ins you prefer.</li>
        <li>Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of the dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

    <h2>Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Brownie Mix Cookies</h2>

    <p>While the recipe is simple, there are a few tips to ensure your gluten-free brownie mix cookies turn out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use high-quality ingredients:</strong> Since gluten-free baking can sometimes be tricky, using high-quality gluten-free brownie mix and fresh ingredients will yield the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't overbake:</strong> Gluten-free cookies can dry out quickly, so it's important to remove them from the oven while the centers are still soft. They will continue to set as they cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with add-ins:</strong> Feel free to get creative with your cookies by adding nuts, dried fruit, or even a swirl of peanut butter for extra flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Store properly:</strong> To keep your cookies fresh, store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. You can also freeze the dough or baked cookies for longer storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Brownie Mix Cookies</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>Can I use a different type of gluten-free mix?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can experiment with different gluten-free mixes, but keep in mind that the texture and flavor may vary. A brownie mix is ideal for achieving that fudgy, chocolatey cookie texture.</p>

        <h3>Can I make these cookies vegan?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! You can substitute the eggs with a flax egg (1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons water per egg) and use a vegan butter alternative. Just make sure your brownie mix is also vegan-friendly.</p>

        <h3>How do I know if my cookies are done?</h3>
        <p>The cookies are done when the edges are set, but the centers are still soft. They will continue to firm up as they cool, so it's better to slightly underbake them than to overbake.</p>

        <h3>Can I add nuts or other mix-ins?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can add nuts, chocolate chips, or any other mix-ins you like. Just fold them into the dough before scooping and baking.</p>
    </div>
