    <h1>Dairy-Free, Gluten-Free, Nut-Free Snacks: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In today’s world, dietary restrictions are becoming increasingly common due to allergies, intolerances, or personal health choices. For those who need to avoid dairy, gluten, and nuts, finding snacks that are safe and satisfying can be a challenge.
