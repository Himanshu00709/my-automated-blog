As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to improve their overall health and well-being.</p>

<p>Gluten-free cereals are made from grains and ingredients that do not contain gluten, such as rice, corn, quinoa, and oats (provided they are certified gluten-free). These cereals are not only safe for those with gluten-related disorders but also offer a range of nutritional benefits.</p>
