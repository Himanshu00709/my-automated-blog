<h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Stelline Pasta</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free stelline pasta is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to keep in mind to ensure the best results:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Always use a large pot of boiling water to cook your pasta. This prevents the pasta from sticking together and ensures even cooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Salt the Water:</strong> Add a generous amount of salt to the boiling water. This enhances the flavor of the pasta.</li>
    <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can be more prone to sticking, so stir it frequently during cooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free pasta often cooks faster than traditional pasta, so start checking for doneness a minute or two before the package instructions suggest.</li>
    <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Some gluten-free pastas benefit from a quick rinse after cooking to remove excess starch, but this can also remove some of the sauce-adhering qualities, so use your judgment.</li>
</ol>
