<h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Angel Hair Pasta</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free angel hair pasta requires a bit of attention to detail, as it can become mushy if overcooked. Follow these steps for perfect results:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Boil Water:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Use about 4-6 quarts of water per pound of pasta.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Pasta:</strong> Gently add the gluten-free angel hair pasta to the boiling water. Stir immediately to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook Al Dente:</strong> Cook for 3-5 minutes, or according to the package instructions. Gluten-free pasta tends to cook faster than traditional pasta, so keep an eye on it.</li>
    <li><strong>Test for Doneness:</strong> Taste a strand to ensure it’s cooked to your desired texture. It should be tender but still have a slight bite.</li>
    <li><strong>Drain and Serve:</strong> Drain the pasta in a colander and toss it with your favorite sauce or toppings.</li>
</ol>
