    <h2>Cooking Tips for Gluten-Free Casarecce Pasta</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free pasta can be a bit different from cooking traditional wheat pasta. Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free casarecce pasta turns out perfectly:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so use a large pot of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Stir the pasta occasionally to prevent it from clumping together.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can go from perfectly cooked to overcooked quickly, so start checking for doneness a minute or two before the recommended cooking time.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Some gluten-free pastas benefit from a quick rinse after cooking to remove excess starch, but be cautious as this can also remove some of the sauce-adhering qualities.</li>
        <li><strong>Pair with the Right Sauce:</strong> Casarecce pasta's twisted shape is ideal for holding onto chunky sauces, pesto, or creamy sauces. Experiment with different combinations to find your favorite.</li>
    </ul>
