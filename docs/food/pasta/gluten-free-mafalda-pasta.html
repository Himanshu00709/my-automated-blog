    <h2>Cooking Tips for Gluten-Free Mafalda Pasta</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free pasta can be a bit different from cooking traditional pasta, as gluten-free varieties tend to have a different texture and cooking time. Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free mafalda pasta turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use plenty of water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can become sticky if not cooked in enough water. Use a large pot with plenty of boiling water to prevent the pasta from clumping together.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir frequently:</strong> Stir the pasta occasionally during cooking to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the cooking time:</strong> Gluten-free pasta often cooks faster than traditional pasta, so be sure to check the package instructions and taste the pasta a minute or two before the recommended cooking time.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with caution:</strong> While some people prefer to rinse pasta after cooking, this can remove the starch that helps sauces adhere to the pasta. If you choose to rinse, do so briefly with cold water.</li>
        <li><strong>Pair with the right sauce:</strong> Gluten-free mafalda pasta pairs well with a variety of sauces, from light olive oil and garlic to rich tomato or cream-based sauces. Experiment with different combinations to find your favorite.</li>
    </ul>
