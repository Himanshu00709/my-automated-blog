    <h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Rotini</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free rotini is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to keep in mind to achieve the perfect texture. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil Water:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Use about 4-6 quarts of water per pound of pasta.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Rotini:</strong> Gently add the gluten-free rotini to the boiling water. Stir immediately to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Al Dente:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to cook faster than traditional pasta. Check the package instructions, but typically, it takes 7-9 minutes to cook al dente.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain and Rinse:</strong> Once cooked, drain the pasta in a colander. Some people prefer to rinse gluten-free pasta with cold water to remove excess starch, which can improve texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve Immediately:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can become sticky if left to sit, so serve it immediately with your favorite sauce or toppings.</li>
