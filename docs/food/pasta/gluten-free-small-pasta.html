<h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Small Pasta</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free small pasta requires a slightly different approach compared to traditional pasta. Here are some tips to ensure perfect results every time:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so it's essential to use a large pot of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>

</ol>
