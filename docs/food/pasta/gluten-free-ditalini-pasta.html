<h2>Cooking Tips for Gluten-Free Ditalini Pasta</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free pasta can be a bit different from cooking traditional wheat-based pasta. Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free ditalini pasta turns out perfectly every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use plenty of water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so using a large pot of boiling water helps prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Stir frequently:</strong> Stirring the pasta during the first few minutes of cooking can help prevent clumping.</li>
    <li><strong>Check the cooking time:</strong> Gluten-free pasta often cooks faster than traditional pasta, so keep an eye on it to avoid overcooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Rinse with caution:</strong> Some people prefer to rinse gluten-free pasta after cooking to remove excess starch, but this can also remove some of the sauce-adhering qualities. Use your discretion based on the dish you’re preparing.</li>
