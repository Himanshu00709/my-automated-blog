<h2>Cooking Tips for Gluten-Free Penne</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free penne requires a slightly different approach compared to traditional pasta. Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free penne turns out perfectly:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so use a large pot of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Stir the pasta occasionally to prevent it from clumping together.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Doneness Early:</strong> Gluten-free penne can cook faster than traditional pasta, so start checking for doneness a couple of minutes before the package instructions suggest.</li>
    <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Rinsing gluten-free pasta can remove some of the starch that helps sauces cling to it. If you do rinse, do so lightly.</li>
    <li><strong>Pair with the Right Sauce:</strong> Gluten-free penne pairs well with a variety of sauces, from light olive oil and garlic to hearty meat sauces.</li>
</ul>
