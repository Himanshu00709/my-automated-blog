    <ul>

        <li><strong>Follow the package instructions:</strong> Garofalo provides specific cooking times for their gluten-free pasta. Be sure to follow these instructions to achieve the perfect al dente texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with caution:</strong> Unlike traditional pasta, gluten-free pasta should not be rinsed after cooking, as this can remove the starch that helps the sauce adhere to the pasta.</li>
