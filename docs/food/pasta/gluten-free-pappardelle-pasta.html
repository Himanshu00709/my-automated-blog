<h2>Cooking Tips for Gluten-Free Pappardelle Pasta</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free pappardelle pasta requires a slightly different approach compared to traditional pasta. Here are some tips to ensure the best results:</p>

<ul>

    <li><strong>Pair with the Right Sauce:</strong> Gluten-free pappardelle pairs well with rich, hearty sauces like Bolognese, creamy Alfredo, or a simple olive oil and garlic sauce.</li>
