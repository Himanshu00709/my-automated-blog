<h2>Cooking Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Pasta</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free pasta can be a bit different from cooking traditional pasta, but with a few tips, you can achieve perfect results every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use plenty of water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to absorb more water, so make sure to use a large pot with plenty of boiling water.</li>
    <li><strong>Stir frequently:</strong> To prevent the pasta from sticking together, stir it frequently during cooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Follow the package instructions:</strong> Barilla provides specific cooking times on the package, so be sure to follow them for the best texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Rinse with caution:</strong> Some people prefer to rinse gluten-free pasta after cooking to remove excess starch, but this can also remove some of the flavor. If you do rinse, do so quickly and with cold water.</li>
</ul>
