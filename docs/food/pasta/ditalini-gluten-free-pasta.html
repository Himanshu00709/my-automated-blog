<h2>Cooking Tips for Gluten-Free Ditalini Pasta</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free pasta can be slightly different from cooking traditional wheat pasta. Here are some tips to ensure your Ditalini gluten-free pasta turns out perfectly every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so use a large pot of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Stir the pasta occasionally to prevent it from clumping together.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Doneness Early:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can cook faster than wheat pasta, so start checking for doneness a couple of minutes before the package instructions suggest.</li>
    <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Some gluten-free pastas benefit from a quick rinse after cooking to remove excess starch, but this can also remove some of the sauce-adhering properties.</li>
</ul>
