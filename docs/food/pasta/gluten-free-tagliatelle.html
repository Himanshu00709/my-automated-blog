    <h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Tagliatelle</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free tagliatelle requires a slightly different approach compared to traditional wheat-based pasta. Here are some tips to ensure perfect results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so use a large pot of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt the Water:</strong> Add a generous amount of salt to the boiling water to enhance the pasta's flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow Cooking Time:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can become mushy if overcooked, so adhere to the package instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Avoid rinsing the pasta after cooking, as this can remove the starch that helps the sauce adhere.</li>
        <li><strong>Pair with the Right Sauce:</strong> Gluten-free tagliatelle pairs well with creamy sauces, pesto, or light olive oil-based sauces.</li>
    </ol>
