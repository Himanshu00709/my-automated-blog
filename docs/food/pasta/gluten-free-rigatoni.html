    <h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Rigatoni</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free rigatoni is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to ensure the best results:</p>

    <ol>

        <li><strong>Check the cooking time:</strong> Gluten-free rigatoni may cook faster than traditional pasta, so keep an eye on it to avoid overcooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with caution:</strong> Unlike traditional pasta, rinsing gluten-free pasta can remove the starch that helps sauces adhere. Only rinse if the recipe specifically calls for it.</li>
    </ol>
