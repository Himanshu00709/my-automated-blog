    <h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Capellini</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free capellini requires a slightly different approach than traditional pasta. Here are some tips to ensure perfect results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so use a large pot of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Stir the pasta during the first few minutes of cooking to prevent clumping.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness Early:</strong> Gluten-free pasta cooks faster than wheat-based pasta, so start checking for doneness a minute or two before the package instructions suggest.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Rinsing gluten-free pasta can remove excess starch, but it may also wash away nutrients. Use your discretion.</li>
    </ol>
