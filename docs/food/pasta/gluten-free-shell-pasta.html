    <h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Shell Pasta</h2>
    <p>Cooking gluten-free shell pasta requires a slightly different approach than traditional pasta. Here are some tips to ensure perfect results:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use plenty of water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so use a large pot of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir frequently:</strong> Stir the pasta during the first few minutes of cooking to prevent clumping.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness early:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can go from al dente to overcooked quickly, so start testing a minute or two before the package instructions suggest.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with caution:</strong> Rinsing gluten-free pasta can remove excess starch, but it may also wash away nutrients. Only rinse if the recipe calls for it.</li>
    </ul>
