<h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Linguine Perfectly</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free linguine requires a slightly different approach than traditional pasta. Here are some tips to ensure your noodles turn out perfectly al dente:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Boil a large pot of water to prevent the noodles from sticking together.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Salt:</strong> Season the water generously with salt to enhance the flavor of the pasta.</li>
    <li><strong>Follow Package Instructions:</strong> Gluten-free pasta often cooks faster than wheat-based pasta, so check the package for specific cooking times.</li>
    <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Stir the noodles occasionally to prevent clumping.</li>
    <li><strong>Test for Doneness:</strong> Taste the pasta a minute or two before the recommended cooking time to avoid overcooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Avoid rinsing the noodles after cooking, as this can remove the starch that helps sauces adhere to the pasta.</li>
</ol>
