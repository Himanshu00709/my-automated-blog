<h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Cavatappi</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free cavatappi is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Boiling Water:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Use plenty of water to prevent the pasta from sticking together.</li>
    <li><strong>Cooking Time:</strong> Gluten-free pasta often cooks faster than traditional pasta, so be sure to check the package instructions for the recommended cooking time. Overcooking can lead to a mushy texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Rinsing:</strong> Unlike traditional pasta, gluten-free pasta should not be rinsed after cooking. Rinsing can remove the starch that helps sauces adhere to the pasta.</li>
    <li><strong>Sauce Pairing:</strong> Gluten-free cavatappi pairs well with a variety of sauces, including marinara, Alfredo, pesto, and olive oil-based sauces. Be sure to choose gluten-free sauces if you have a gluten intolerance.</li>
