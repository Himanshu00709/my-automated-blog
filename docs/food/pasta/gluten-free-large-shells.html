    <h1>Gluten-Free Large Shells: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular over the years, not only for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also for individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle.

    <h2>Cooking Tips for Gluten-Free Large Shells</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free large shells requires a slightly different approach compared to traditional pasta. Here are some tips to ensure perfect results every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so use a large pot of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Stir the shells occasionally to prevent them from clumping together.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness Early:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can go from undercooked to overcooked quickly, so start checking for doneness a minute or two before the recommended cooking time.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Rinsing gluten-free pasta can remove the starch that helps sauces adhere, so only rinse if the recipe specifically calls for it.</li>
    </ul>
