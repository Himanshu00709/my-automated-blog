<h1>Penne Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Penne Perfectly</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free penne requires a slightly different approach than traditional pasta. Here are some tips to ensure you get it just right:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to absorb more water, so make sure to use a large pot with plenty of boiling water.</li>
    <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can stick together more easily, so stir it frequently to prevent clumping.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Doneness Early:</strong> Gluten-free penne often cooks faster than traditional pasta, so start checking for doneness a couple of minutes before the package instructions suggest.</li>
    <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Some people recommend rinsing gluten-free pasta after cooking to remove excess starch, but this can also wash away some of the nutrients. Use your discretion.</li>
