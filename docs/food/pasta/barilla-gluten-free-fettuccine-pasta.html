    <h2>Cooking Tips for Perfect Gluten-Free Fettuccine</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free pasta can be slightly different from cooking traditional wheat-based pasta. Here are some tips to ensure your Barilla Gluten-Free Fettuccine turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Always cook your pasta in a large pot of boiling water. This prevents the pasta from sticking together and ensures even cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can be more delicate, so stirring frequently helps prevent clumping.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow the Package Instructions:</strong> Barilla provides specific cooking times on the package. Overcooking can make the pasta mushy, so keep an eye on the clock.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Unlike traditional pasta, gluten-free pasta should not be rinsed after cooking. Rinsing can remove the starch that helps the sauce adhere to the pasta.</li>
