<h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Rotini Noodles</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free rotini noodles is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to keep in mind to achieve the perfect texture:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Boil Water:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Use more water than you would for regular pasta to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Noodles:</strong> Once the water is boiling, add the gluten-free rotini noodles. Stir gently to prevent clumping.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook Time:</strong> Follow the package instructions for cooking time, but start checking a minute or two earlier. Gluten-free pasta can go from perfectly cooked to mushy quickly.</li>
    <li><strong>Drain and Rinse:</strong> Drain the noodles in a colander and rinse them briefly with cold water to stop the cooking process and remove excess starch.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Toss the noodles with your favorite sauce or toppings and serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
