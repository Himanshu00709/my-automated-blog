<h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Rotini Pasta</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free rotini pasta requires a slightly different approach compared to traditional wheat-based pasta. Here are some tips to ensure perfect results every time:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so use a large pot of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Stir the pasta during the first few minutes of cooking to prevent clumping.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Doneness Early:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can go from al dente to overcooked quickly, so start checking a minute or two before the package instructions suggest.</li>
    <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Rinsing gluten-free pasta can remove excess starch, but it may also wash away nutrients. Rinse only if the recipe calls for it.</li>
