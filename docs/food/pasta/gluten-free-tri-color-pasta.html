    <h1>Gluten-Free Tri-Color Pasta: A Nutritious and Delicious Choice</h1>

    <p>In recent years, gluten-free diets have gained immense popularity, not just among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but also among health-conscious individuals seeking to improve their overall well-being.

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Tri-Color Pasta?</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free tri-color pasta is a type of pasta made from gluten-free grains such as rice, corn, quinoa, or legumes like chickpeas and lentils. The "tri-color" aspect comes from the addition of natural ingredients like spinach and beetroot, which give the pasta its distinctive green and red hues, respectively, alongside the natural color of the base flour. This not only makes the pasta visually appealing but also adds a nutritional boost.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten-Free Tri-Color Pasta</h2>

    <h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Tri-Color Pasta</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free tri-color pasta is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to ensure the best results:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to absorb more water, so use a large pot with plenty of boiling water.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Salt:</strong> Season the water with salt to enhance the pasta's flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can stick together, so stir it occasionally during cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free pasta cooks faster than wheat pasta, so start checking for doneness a minute or two before the package instructions suggest.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Some gluten-free pastas benefit from a quick rinse to remove excess starch, but this can vary by brand.</li>
    </ol>
