    <h1>Gluten-Free Anellini Pasta: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular over the years, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference.

In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free anellini pasta, from its nutritional benefits to cooking tips and recipe ideas.</p>

    <h2>What is Anellini Pasta?</h2>
    <p>Anellini pasta is a small, ring-shaped pasta that originates from Italy. Its name, "anellini," translates to "little rings" in Italian, which perfectly describes its shape. Traditionally, anellini pasta is used in soups, salads, and casseroles due to its ability to hold sauces and ingredients well. However, for those who follow a gluten-free diet, traditional wheat-based anellini pasta is off the table. That’s where gluten-free anellini pasta comes in.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Anellini Pasta?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free anellini pasta is made from alternative flours such as rice, corn, quinoa, or chickpea flour. These ingredients not only make the pasta safe for those with gluten intolerance but also offer additional nutritional benefits. For example, chickpea flour is high in protein and fiber, while quinoa flour is rich in essential amino acids. Here’s a quick comparison of traditional anellini pasta and gluten-free anellini pasta:</p>
