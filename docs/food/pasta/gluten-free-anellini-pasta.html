<h2>Cooking Tips for Gluten-Free Anellini Pasta</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free anellini pasta requires a slightly different approach than cooking traditional wheat pasta. Here are some tips to ensure your pasta turns out perfectly every time:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so use a large pot of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Stir Frequently:</strong> Stir the pasta occasionally during cooking to prevent clumping.</li>
    <li><strong>Check for Doneness:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can become mushy if overcooked, so check for doneness a minute or two before the recommended cooking time.</li>
    <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Rinsing gluten-free pasta can remove the starch that helps sauces adhere, so only rinse if the recipe specifically calls for it.</li>
    <li><strong>Pair with the Right Sauce:</strong> Gluten-free anellini pasta pairs well with light sauces, such as olive oil-based sauces, pesto, or tomato-based sauces.</li>
