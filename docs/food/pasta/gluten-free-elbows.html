<p>As seen in the table, gluten-free elbows tend to have slightly fewer calories and more fiber compared to traditional pasta. However, traditional pasta generally contains more protein. The absence of gluten in gluten-free elbows is the most significant difference, making them a suitable option for those with gluten intolerance.</p>

<h2>How to Cook Gluten-Free Elbows</h2>

<p>Cooking gluten-free elbows is similar to cooking traditional pasta, but there are a few key differences to keep in mind to achieve the best results:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Boil Water:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Use plenty of water to prevent the pasta from sticking together.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Pasta:</strong> Add the gluten-free elbows to the boiling water. Stir gently to separate the pieces.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook Time:</strong> Gluten-free pasta often cooks faster than traditional pasta, so check the package instructions for the recommended cooking time. Typically, it takes about 7-9 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Test for Doneness:</strong> Taste a piece of pasta to ensure it's cooked to your desired level of tenderness. Gluten-free pasta can become mushy if overcooked, so it's important to monitor it closely.</li>
    <li><strong>Drain and Serve:</strong> Once cooked, drain the pasta and rinse it briefly with warm water to remove excess starch. Serve immediately with your favorite sauce or toppings.</li>
</ol>
