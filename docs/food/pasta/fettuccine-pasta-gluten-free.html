    <h2>Cooking Tips for Gluten-Free Fettuccine</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free fettuccine requires a slightly different approach than traditional pasta. Here are some tips to ensure your gluten-free fettuccine turns out perfectly every time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use plenty of water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to release more starch, so use a large pot of boiling water to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir frequently:</strong> Stir the pasta during the first few minutes of cooking to prevent clumping.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for doneness early:</strong> Gluten-free pasta can cook faster than traditional pasta, so start checking for doneness a couple of minutes before the package instructions suggest.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse with caution:</strong> Some gluten-free pastas benefit from a quick rinse after cooking to remove excess starch, but this can also remove some of the sauce-adhering properties.</li>
        <li><strong>Pair with the right sauce:</strong> Gluten-free fettuccine pairs well with creamy sauces, pesto, or simple olive oil and garlic.</li>
    </ul>
