    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Cannelloni Pasta</h2>

    <p>Now that you have your ingredients ready, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of making gluten-free cannelloni pasta:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, spinach, and ground meat (if using). Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Fill the Cannelloni Tubes</h3>
    <p>Using a piping bag or a small spoon, carefully fill each gluten-free cannelloni tube with the ricotta mixture. Be gentle to avoid breaking the tubes, as gluten-free pasta can be more delicate than traditional pasta.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Dish</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange the filled cannelloni tubes in a single layer on top of the sauce. Pour the remaining tomato sauce over the tubes, ensuring they are fully covered. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese on top.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake and Serve</h3>
    <p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Let the dish cool for a few minutes before serving.</p>

        <h3>2. What can I use instead of ricotta cheese?</h3>

        <h3>3. Are gluten-free cannelloni tubes easy to find?</h3>
