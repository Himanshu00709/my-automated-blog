    <p>Cooking gluten-free jumbo shells pasta requires a slightly different approach than traditional pasta. Here’s a step-by-step guide to ensure perfect results every time:</p>

    <ol>

        <li><strong>Drain and Rinse:</strong> Once cooked, drain the pasta and rinse it briefly with cold water to stop the cooking process and remove excess starch.</li>
        <li><strong>Stuff and Bake:</strong> If using the shells for a stuffed pasta dish, fill them with your desired filling and bake according to your recipe.</li>
