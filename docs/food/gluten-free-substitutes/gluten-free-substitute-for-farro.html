<ul>
    <li><strong>Quinoa:</strong> Rinse thoroughly before cooking to remove saponins, which can cause a bitter taste. Use a 1:2 ratio of quinoa to water and cook for about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Brown Rice:</strong> Use a 1:2.5 ratio of rice to water and cook for 30-40 minutes. For a chewier texture, opt for short-grain brown rice.</li>
    <li><strong>Millet:</strong> Toast the grains in a dry pan before cooking to enhance their nutty flavor. Use a 1:2.5 ratio of millet to water and cook for 20-25 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Buckwheat:</strong> Use a 1:2 ratio of buckwheat to water and cook for 10-15 minutes. Be careful not to overcook, as it can become mushy.</li>
    <li><strong>Amaranth:</strong> Use a 1:3 ratio of amaranth to water and cook for 20-25 minutes. It has a sticky texture, making it ideal for porridge or binding ingredients in baked goods.</li>
    <li><strong>Teff:</strong> Use a 1:3 ratio of teff to water and cook for 15-20 minutes. Its fine texture makes it perfect for baking or thickening stews.</li>
