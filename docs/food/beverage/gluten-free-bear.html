    <h1>Gluten-Free Beer: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For beer enthusiasts with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, the idea of enjoying a cold brew without the adverse effects of gluten might seem like a distant dream. However, the rise of gluten-free beer has made this dream a reality. In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free beer, from its production process to its health benefits and popular brands.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Beer?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free beer is a type of beer that is brewed without the use of gluten-containing grains such as barley, wheat, or rye. Instead, it is made from alternative grains like sorghum, rice, millet, or corn. Some breweries also use enzymes to break down gluten proteins in traditional beer, making it safe for those with gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>How is Gluten-Free Beer Made?</h2>
    <p>The production of gluten-free beer involves a unique brewing process that differs from traditional beer-making. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Selection of Gluten-Free Grains:</strong> Brewers choose grains like sorghum, rice, or millet as the base for the beer.</li>
        <li><strong>Mashing:</strong> The grains are mashed to extract fermentable sugars.</li>
        <li><strong>Boiling:</strong> The mash is boiled, and hops are added for flavor and aroma.</li>
        <li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> Yeast is added to the mixture to ferment the sugars into alcohol.</li>
        <li><strong>Filtration:</strong> The beer is filtered to remove any remaining gluten particles.</li>
        <li><strong>Packaging:</strong> The final product is packaged and ready for consumption.</li>
    </ul>
