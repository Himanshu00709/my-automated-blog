<h1>Boba Gluten-Free: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Boba tea, also known as bubble tea, has become a global phenomenon, captivating taste buds with its unique combination of tea, milk, and chewy tapioca pearls.

This guide will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free boba, from what it is to where you can find it, and how to make it at home.</p>

<h2>What is Boba?</h2>

<p>Boba tea originated in Taiwan in the 1980s and has since spread worldwide.
