    <h1>Gluten-Free Matzo by Manischewitz: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For those who follow a gluten-free diet, finding traditional foods that meet dietary restrictions can be a challenge. Matzo, a staple during Passover, is no exception. However, Manischewitz, a trusted name in kosher foods, has risen to the occasion with their gluten-free matzo. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free matzo by Manischewitz, from its ingredients to its nutritional value, and how it fits into a gluten-free lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten-Free Matzo?</h2>

    <p>Matzo, also known as matzah, is an unleavened bread traditionally eaten during the Jewish holiday of Passover. It is made from flour and water, and it must be baked quickly to prevent fermentation. Traditional matzo contains wheat flour, which is off-limits for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Manischewitz’s gluten-free matzo is made with alternative flours, such as tapioca and potato starch, making it safe for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients and Nutritional Information</h2>

    <p>Manischewitz’s gluten-free matzo is crafted with care to ensure it meets the dietary needs of those avoiding gluten. The primary ingredients include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Tapioca Starch</li>
        <li>Potato Starch</li>
        <li>Egg Whites</li>
        <li>Palm Oil</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here’s a breakdown of the nutritional content per serving (1 sheet of matzo):</p>

    <h2>How Does Gluten-Free Matzo Compare to Traditional Matzo?</h2>

    <p>Traditional matzo is made from wheat flour, which gives it a distinct texture and flavor. Gluten-free matzo, on the other hand, uses alternative flours like tapioca and potato starch. This results in a slightly different texture—crisp yet tender—and a milder flavor. While it may not be identical to traditional matzo, Manischewitz’s gluten-free version is a close approximation that allows those with gluten sensitivities to participate in Passover traditions without compromise.</p>

    <h2>How to Use Gluten-Free Matzo</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free matzo can be used in the same way as traditional matzo. Here are some popular ways to enjoy it:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Matzo Brei:</strong> A traditional Jewish dish made by soaking matzo in water, then frying it with eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Matzo Ball Soup:</strong> While the matzo balls themselves are typically made from matzo meal, you can use gluten-free matzo to make a gluten-free version of this classic soup.</li>
        <li><strong>Matzo Pizza:</strong> Top gluten-free matzo with tomato sauce, cheese, and your favorite toppings for a quick and easy pizza.</li>
        <li><strong>Snacking:</strong> Enjoy gluten-free matzo on its own or with spreads like hummus, avocado, or nut butter.</li>
    </ul>
