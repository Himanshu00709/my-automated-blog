    <h1>Gluten-Free Pasta Alternatives: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free products has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the growing popularity of gluten-free diets.

However, it's important to note that not all gluten-free pasta is created equal, and some options may be more nutritious than others.</p>

    <h2>Cooking Tips for Gluten-Free Pasta</h2>

    <p>Cooking gluten-free pasta can be a bit different from cooking traditional wheat pasta. Here are some tips to ensure your pasta turns out perfectly:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Plenty of Water:</strong> Gluten-free pasta tends to absorb more water, so use a large pot with plenty of boiling water.</li>

        <li><strong>Rinse with Caution:</strong> Some gluten-free pastas benefit from a quick rinse after cooking to remove excess starch, but this can also remove some of the nutrients, so do so sparingly.</li>
    </ul>
