    <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> You control the ingredients, ensuring your meals are free from gluten, dairy, and other allergens.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Preparing meals in bulk can be more economical than buying pre-packaged gluten and dairy-free options.</li>

<h2>Tips for Preparing Gluten and Dairy-Free Freezer Meals</h2>

<p>Preparing freezer meals requires some planning, but the effort is well worth it. Here are some tips to help you get started:</p>

<h3>1. Plan Your Meals</h3>

<h3>2. Invest in Quality Containers</h3>

<h3>5. Properly Cool and Freeze</h3>
