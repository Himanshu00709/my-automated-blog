<h2>What to Look for in a Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>

<p>When searching for the perfect gluten-free pizza, there are a few key factors to consider:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Crust Quality:</strong> The crust is the foundation of any good pizza. Look for a crust that is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, without being too dense or crumbly.</li>
    <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> A great gluten-free pizza should have a variety of fresh and flavorful toppings. Whether you prefer classic pepperoni or something more adventurous like artichokes and goat cheese, the toppings should complement the crust.</li>
    <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Cross-contamination is a concern for those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance. Ensure that the restaurant has a dedicated gluten-free preparation area and uses separate utensils and equipment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Gluten-Free Pizza Recipes to Try at Home</h2>

<p>If you prefer to make your own gluten-free pizza at home, there are plenty of recipes and pre-made crusts available. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started:</p>

<h3>Gluten-Free Pizza Crust Recipe</h3>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
    <li>1 tsp xanthan gum (if not included in the flour blend)</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
    <li>1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) active dry yeast</li>
    <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
</ul>

<ol>
