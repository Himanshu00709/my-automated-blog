    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have gained popularity not only among those with celiac disease but also among individuals who experience gluten sensitivity or simply prefer a gluten-free lifestyle. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues and other health problems for some people.

    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. Here are some key factors to consider when choosing a gluten-free pizza:</p>

    <h3>1. Crust Quality</h3>
    <p>The crust is the foundation of any pizza, and for gluten-free options, it's crucial that the crust is both flavorful and has the right texture. Look for crusts made from high-quality ingredients like almond flour, cauliflower, or rice flour. These alternatives not only provide a great taste but also ensure that the crust holds up well under the weight of toppings.</p>

    <h3>2. Fresh Toppings</h3>
    <p>Fresh, high-quality toppings can make or break a pizza. Whether you prefer classic toppings like pepperoni and mushrooms or more adventurous options like arugula and prosciutto, ensure that the ingredients are fresh and well-prepared. Many gluten-free pizzerias in Vancouver pride themselves on using locally sourced, organic ingredients.</p>

    <h3>3. Cross-Contamination Prevention</h3>
    <p>For those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, cross-contamination is a significant concern. Ensure that the pizzeria you choose has strict protocols in place to prevent cross-contamination, such as separate preparation areas and dedicated utensils for gluten-free orders.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>
    <p>While gluten-free pizza is essential for those with gluten-related disorders, it can also offer health benefits for others. Gluten-free crusts often contain more fiber and nutrients than traditional wheat-based crusts, especially when made with whole grains like quinoa or buckwheat. Additionally, gluten-free pizzas can be lower in calories and carbohydrates, making them a healthier option for those looking to maintain a balanced diet.</p>

        <p>While many pizzerias in Vancouver offer gluten-free options, not all do. It's always a good idea to check the menu or call ahead to confirm.</p>

        <h3>2. Are gluten-free pizzas more expensive?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free pizzas can be slightly more expensive due to the cost of alternative ingredients and the additional care required to prevent cross-contamination. However, many places offer competitive pricing.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I find vegan gluten-free pizza in Vancouver?</h3>
        <p>Yes, several pizzerias in Vancouver offer vegan and gluten-free pizza options. Virtuous Pie, for example, specializes in plant-based, gluten-free pizzas.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I know if a pizzeria takes cross-contamination seriously?</h3>
