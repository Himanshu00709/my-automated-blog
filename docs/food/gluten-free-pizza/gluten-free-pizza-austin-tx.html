<h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

<p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. Here are some factors to consider when choosing a gluten-free pizza:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Crust Quality:</strong> The crust should be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, without being too dense or crumbly.</li>
    <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> Fresh, high-quality toppings can make or break a pizza. Look for places that use locally sourced ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> For those with celiac disease, cross-contamination is a serious concern. Choose restaurants with dedicated gluten-free kitchens or strict preparation protocols.</li>
    <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> A great gluten-free pizza should be just as flavorful as its gluten-containing counterpart. The sauce, cheese, and toppings should all work together harmoniously.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for Enjoying Gluten-Free Pizza in Austin</h2>

<p>Here are some tips to ensure you have the best gluten-free pizza experience in Austin:</p>

    <li><strong>Check Reviews:</strong> Online reviews can provide valuable insights into the quality and safety of a restaurant’s gluten-free options.</li>
