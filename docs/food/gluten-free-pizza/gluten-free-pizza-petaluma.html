    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>A great gluten-free pizza starts with the crust. The best gluten-free crusts are made from a blend of gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour, which provide a texture and flavor that closely mimic traditional pizza crust. Additionally, the toppings and sauce play a crucial role. Fresh, high-quality ingredients can elevate a gluten-free pizza from good to exceptional.</p>

    <p>For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, gluten-free pizza is not just a dietary preference but a necessity. However, even for those without these conditions, gluten-free pizza can offer health benefits. Many gluten-free crusts are made with nutrient-dense ingredients like almond flour, which is high in protein and healthy fats. Additionally, gluten-free pizza can be lower in calories and carbohydrates, making it a healthier option for those watching their weight or managing blood sugar levels.</p>
