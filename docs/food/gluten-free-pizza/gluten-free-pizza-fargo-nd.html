<h2>What to Look for in a Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>

<p>When searching for the perfect gluten-free pizza, there are a few key factors to consider:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Crust Quality:</strong> The crust is the foundation of any pizza. Look for a crust that is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Many gluten-free crusts are made from alternative flours like rice, almond, or tapioca.</li>
    <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> Ensure that the toppings are also gluten-free. Some sauces and processed meats may contain hidden gluten, so it’s important to ask about ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> Cross-contamination can occur if gluten-free pizza is prepared in the same area as regular pizza. Look for restaurants that have dedicated gluten-free preparation areas or use separate utensils.</li>
</ul>
