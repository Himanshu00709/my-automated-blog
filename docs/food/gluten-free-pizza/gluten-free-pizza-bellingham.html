<h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

<p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. Here are some key factors to consider when choosing a gluten-free pizza:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Crust Quality:</strong> The crust should be crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, without being too dry or crumbly.</li>
    <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> Fresh, high-quality toppings can make or break a pizza. Look for places that use locally sourced ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> For those with celiac disease, it's crucial to ensure that the pizza is prepared in a gluten-free environment to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Taste:</strong> Ultimately, the pizza should taste great! A good gluten-free pizza should be just as satisfying as its gluten-containing counterpart.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making Your Own Gluten-Free Pizza at Home</h2>

<p>If you're feeling adventurous, making your own gluten-free pizza at home can be a fun and rewarding experience. Here are some tips to get you started:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Choose the Right Flour:</strong> There are many gluten-free flours available, such as almond flour, coconut flour, and rice flour. Experiment to find the one that works best for you.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Binders:</strong> Gluten-free dough often needs binders like xanthan gum or psyllium husk to help it hold together.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-Bake the Crust:</strong> Pre-baking the crust for a few minutes before adding toppings can help prevent a soggy pizza.</li>
    <li><strong>Get Creative with Toppings:</strong> Don't be afraid to experiment with different toppings. From classic pepperoni to unique combinations like figs and prosciutto, the possibilities are endless.</li>
