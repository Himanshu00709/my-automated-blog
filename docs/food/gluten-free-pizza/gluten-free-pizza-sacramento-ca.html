<h2>What to Look for in a Gluten-Free Crust</h2>

<p>When ordering gluten-free pizza, it's important to consider the quality of the crust. Not all gluten-free crusts are created equal, and the best ones will be both flavorful and structurally sound. Here are some things to look for:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> A good gluten-free crust will be made from high-quality, gluten-free flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour. Avoid crusts that rely heavily on starches, as they can be overly dense or gummy.</li>
    <li><strong>Texture:</strong> The crust should have a pleasing texture that mimics traditional pizza crust. It should be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.</li>
    <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> The crust should have a neutral or slightly nutty flavor that complements the toppings rather than overpowering them.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> If you have celiac disease or a severe gluten intolerance, make sure the pizzeria takes precautions to avoid cross-contamination. This includes using separate preparation areas, utensils, and ovens for gluten-free pizzas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pizza in Sacramento</h2>

<div class="faq">
    <h3>1. Is gluten-free pizza healthier than regular pizza?</h3>
    <p>Gluten-free pizza is not inherently healthier than regular pizza. While it is a necessary option for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, gluten-free crusts can sometimes be higher in calories and fat due to the ingredients used to replace gluten. It's important to consider the overall nutritional content of the pizza, including the toppings and cheese.</p>

    <h3>2. Can I find vegan gluten-free pizza in Sacramento?</h3>
    <p>Yes, many pizzerias in Sacramento offer vegan and gluten-free options. Be sure to check with the restaurant to ensure that their vegan cheese and toppings are also gluten-free. Some popular spots for vegan gluten-free pizza include MOD Pizza and Pizza Rock.</p>

    <h3>3. How do I know if a pizzeria is safe for celiacs?</h3>
    <p>When dining out with celiac disease, it's crucial to ask about the restaurant's preparation practices. Look for pizzerias that have a dedicated gluten-free menu and take steps to prevent cross-contamination, such as using separate ovens and utensils. You can also check online reviews or contact the restaurant directly to inquire about their gluten-free protocols.</p>

    <h3>4. Are there any gluten-free pizza delivery options in Sacramento?</h3>
    <p>Yes, many pizzerias in Sacramento offer gluten-free pizza for delivery. MOD Pizza, for example, allows you to customize your gluten-free pizza online and have it delivered to your door.
