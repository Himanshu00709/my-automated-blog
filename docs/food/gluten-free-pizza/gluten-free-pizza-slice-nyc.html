<h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

<p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. A great gluten-free pizza should have a crust that is both crispy and chewy, with a flavor that complements the toppings. Here are some key factors to consider when evaluating a gluten-free pizza:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Crust Texture:</strong> The crust should be firm enough to hold the toppings but not so dense that it feels like cardboard.</li>
    <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> The crust should have a pleasant taste, not overly bland or overly seasoned.</li>
    <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> Fresh, high-quality toppings can make or break a pizza. Look for pizzerias that use fresh mozzarella, homemade sauces, and locally sourced ingredients.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> For those with celiac disease, it’s crucial that the pizzeria takes steps to avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing ingredients.</li>
</ul>
