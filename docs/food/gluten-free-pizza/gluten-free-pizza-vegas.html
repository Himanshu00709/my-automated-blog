    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. The key to a great gluten-free pizza lies in the crust. A good gluten-free crust should be crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and free from any grittiness or aftertaste. Many pizzerias in Vegas use a blend of gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour, to achieve the perfect texture. Additionally, the toppings and sauce play a crucial role in enhancing the overall flavor. Fresh, high-quality ingredients are a must for a truly satisfying gluten-free pizza experience.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>
    <p>For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, gluten-free pizza is not just a treat—it's a necessity. Consuming gluten can lead to severe digestive issues, fatigue, and other health problems for these individuals. Even for those without gluten-related health issues, opting for gluten-free pizza can sometimes be a healthier choice. Many gluten-free crusts are made with nutrient-dense flours that provide additional vitamins and minerals. However, it's important to note that gluten-free doesn't always mean healthier, as some gluten-free products can be high in calories and sugar. Always check the nutritional information if you're concerned about your diet.</p>
