    <h1>Gluten-Free Pizza at Costco: A Complete Guide</h1>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular over the years, whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference. For those who love pizza but need to avoid gluten, Costco offers a convenient and delicious solution. In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about gluten-free pizza at Costco, including how to prepare it, its nutritional value, and answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free pizza is a great option for individuals who need to avoid gluten for health reasons or those who simply want to explore alternative dietary options. Costco’s gluten-free pizza is made with high-quality ingredients, ensuring that you don’t have to compromise on taste or texture. Whether you’re hosting a party, having a family dinner, or just craving a slice, Costco’s gluten-free pizza is a convenient and tasty choice.</p>

    <h2>How to Prepare Costco’s Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>
    <p>Preparing Costco’s gluten-free pizza is straightforward and can be done in just a few simple steps. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get the perfect pizza every time:</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h3>
    <p>Start by preheating your oven to the temperature specified on the pizza packaging. Typically, this will be around 425°F (218°C). Preheating ensures that your pizza cooks evenly and achieves that perfect crispy crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Remove the Pizza from Packaging</h3>
    <p>Take the pizza out of its packaging and remove any protective film or cardboard. Place the pizza on a baking sheet or directly on the oven rack, depending on your preference. Using a baking sheet can help prevent any potential mess, while placing it directly on the rack can result in a crispier crust.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Bake the Pizza</h3>
    <p>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for the recommended time, usually between 10-15 minutes. Keep an eye on the pizza to ensure it doesn’t overcook. The cheese should be melted and bubbly, and the crust should be golden brown.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Let It Cool and Serve</h3>
    <p>Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. This allows the cheese to set and makes it easier to cut. Serve your gluten-free pizza with your favorite sides or toppings, and enjoy!</p>
