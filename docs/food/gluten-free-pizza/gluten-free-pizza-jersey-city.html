    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

    <p>A great gluten-free pizza starts with the crust. Unlike traditional pizza dough, gluten-free crusts are made from alternative flours such as rice, almond, or tapioca. These flours provide a different texture and flavor profile, but when done right, they can be just as satisfying as their gluten-containing counterparts. The key is in the preparation—properly mixed and baked gluten-free crusts should be crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.</p>

    <p>Toppings also play a crucial role. Fresh, high-quality ingredients can elevate a gluten-free pizza from good to exceptional. Many pizzerias in Jersey City pride themselves on using locally sourced vegetables, artisanal cheeses, and premium meats to create flavorful combinations that cater to all dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>

    <p>For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, gluten-free pizza is not just a treat—it’s a necessity. Consuming gluten can lead to severe digestive issues, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term health complications. However, even for those without gluten-related health issues, opting for gluten-free pizza can offer several benefits:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Digestion:</strong> Gluten-free diets can reduce bloating, gas, and other digestive discomforts.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Energy:</strong> Some people report feeling more energetic after eliminating gluten from their diet.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Nutrient Absorption:</strong> Gluten-free diets can improve the absorption of essential nutrients, especially for those with celiac disease.</li>
    </ul>
