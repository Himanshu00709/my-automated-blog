    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. A great gluten-free pizza should have a crust that is both flavorful and structurally sound—no one wants a crust that crumbles at the first bite. Here are some key factors to consider when choosing a gluten-free pizza:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crust Quality:</strong> The crust should be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, mimicking the texture of traditional pizza crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> Fresh, high-quality toppings can elevate a gluten-free pizza from good to great. Look for pizzerias that use fresh vegetables, premium meats, and artisanal cheeses.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> For those with celiac disease, cross-contamination is a serious concern. Ensure the pizzeria has strict protocols in place to prevent gluten from coming into contact with your pizza.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety:</strong> A good gluten-free pizzeria will offer a variety of options, from classic Margherita to creative, gourmet combinations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>
    <p>While gluten-free pizza is essential for those with gluten-related disorders, it can also offer health benefits for others. Gluten-free crusts are often made with alternative flours like almond, coconut, or rice flour, which can be lower in calories and higher in nutrients than traditional wheat flour. Additionally, gluten-free pizzas often feature healthier toppings, such as fresh vegetables and lean proteins, making them a nutritious option for anyone.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pizza in Houston</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Is gluten-free pizza healthier than regular pizza?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free pizza can be healthier, especially if it’s made with nutrient-dense flours and topped with fresh ingredients. However, it’s important to note that gluten-free doesn’t automatically mean healthy—some gluten-free crusts can be high in calories and fat.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I find vegan gluten-free pizza in Houston?</h3>
        <p>Yes, many pizzerias in Houston offer vegan and gluten-free options. Pizza Fusion, for example, is known for its vegan-friendly menu that includes gluten-free crusts.</p>

        <h3>3. How do I know if a pizzeria is safe for celiacs?</h3>
        <p>Look for pizzerias that have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen or follow strict protocols to avoid cross-contamination. It’s also a good idea to ask staff about their preparation methods.</p>

        <h3>4. Are gluten-free pizzas more expensive?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free pizzas can be slightly more expensive due to the cost of alternative ingredients and specialized preparation. However, many find the extra cost worth it for the health benefits and peace of mind.</p>
