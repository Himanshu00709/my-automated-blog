    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. A great gluten-free pizza starts with a high-quality crust that mimics the texture and flavor of traditional pizza dough.

However, even for those without gluten-related health issues, gluten-free pizza can offer some benefits. Many gluten-free crusts are made with nutrient-dense flours that provide more vitamins and minerals than traditional wheat flour. Additionally, gluten-free pizza can be easier to digest for some people, leading to less bloating and discomfort after eating.</p>
