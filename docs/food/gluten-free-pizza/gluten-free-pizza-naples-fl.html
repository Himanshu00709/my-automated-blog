    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>A great gluten-free pizza starts with the crust. Unlike traditional pizza dough, gluten-free crusts are made from alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour. These flours provide a different texture and flavor profile, but when done right, they can be just as satisfying as their gluten-containing counterparts. The key to a great gluten-free pizza lies in the balance of flavors, the quality of ingredients, and the cooking technique.</p>

    <p>In Naples, many pizzerias take pride in using high-quality, locally sourced ingredients. Fresh vegetables, artisanal cheeses, and premium meats are often used to top gluten-free pizzas, ensuring a delicious and wholesome dining experience. Additionally, some restaurants offer vegan and dairy-free options, making it easier for those with multiple dietary restrictions to enjoy a slice of pizza.</p>

    <h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and skin problems. By opting for gluten-free pizza, these individuals can enjoy a meal without the risk of adverse reactions. Moreover, gluten-free pizza can be a healthier option for those looking to reduce their carbohydrate intake or avoid processed foods.</p>

    <p>However, it’s important to note that not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. Some may still be high in calories, fat, or sugar, so it’s essential to choose wisely. Look for pizzas made with whole, unprocessed ingredients and avoid those with excessive amounts of cheese or processed meats.</p>
