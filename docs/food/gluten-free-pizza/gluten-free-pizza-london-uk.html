    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

    <p>A great gluten-free pizza starts with the crust. The best gluten-free crusts are made from a blend of gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour, which provide a similar texture to traditional wheat-based crusts. The key is to achieve a balance between crispiness and chewiness, ensuring that the crust holds up under the weight of the toppings without becoming soggy.</p>

    <p>Toppings are equally important. Many gluten-free pizzerias in London use fresh, locally sourced ingredients to create flavorful combinations. From classic Margherita to innovative options like truffle oil and wild mushrooms, the possibilities are endless.

Gluten-free pizza provides a safe and delicious alternative, allowing those with gluten-related disorders to enjoy one of the world’s most beloved foods without worry.</p>

    <p>However, it’s important to note that not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. Some may be high in calories, sugar, or unhealthy fats, so it’s essential to choose pizzerias that prioritize quality ingredients and balanced nutrition. Many gluten-free pizzerias in London are committed to offering healthier options, using whole grains, fresh vegetables, and lean proteins.</p>
