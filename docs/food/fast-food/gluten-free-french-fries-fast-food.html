<h1>Gluten-Free French Fries: A Fast Food Revolution</h1>

<p>French fries are a staple of fast food culture, beloved by millions around the world. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying this classic snack can be a challenge. The good news is that the rise of gluten-free options has made it possible for everyone to indulge in this crispy, golden delight. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free French fries, how they’re made, where to find them, and why they’re a game-changer for fast food lovers.</p>

<h2>What Makes French Fries Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>At their core, French fries are made from potatoes, which are naturally gluten-free. However, the issue arises during the cooking process. Traditional French fries are often cooked in shared fryers with other gluten-containing foods, such as breaded chicken or onion rings, leading to cross-contamination. Additionally, some fast food chains may coat their fries in flour or use seasonings that contain gluten.</p>

<p>Gluten-free French fries are prepared in a way that avoids these pitfalls. They are typically cooked in dedicated fryers to prevent cross-contamination and are seasoned with gluten-free ingredients. This ensures that the fries are safe for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>
