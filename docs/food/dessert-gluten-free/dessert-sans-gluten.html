    <h1>Dessert Sans Gluten: A Guide to Gluten-Free Sweet Treats</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free desserts has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of gluten intolerance, celiac disease, and the desire for healthier eating habits. Dessert sans gluten doesn’t mean sacrificing flavor or texture. In fact, gluten-free desserts can be just as indulgent, creative, and satisfying as their traditional counterparts. Whether you’re a seasoned gluten-free baker or just starting your journey, this guide will explore the world of gluten-free desserts, offering tips, recipes, and insights to help you create delicious treats that everyone can enjoy.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. It provides elasticity to dough, helping it rise and maintain its shape. However, for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems. Even for those without gluten-related conditions, reducing gluten intake can sometimes improve digestion and overall well-being.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free desserts are made without any ingredients containing gluten. This requires substituting traditional flours like wheat flour with alternatives such as almond flour, coconut flour, rice flour, or gluten-free oat flour. The key to successful gluten-free baking lies in understanding how these substitutes work and how to balance flavors and textures.</p>

    <h2>Popular Gluten-Free Dessert Options</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free desserts come in a wide variety, from cakes and cookies to pies and puddings. Here are some popular options:</p>
