    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups gluten-free flour blend</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water (or plant-based milk for extra richness)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup tofu or cashew cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely chopped vegetables (e.g., spinach, mushrooms)</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, water, and olive oil. Knead the dough until it’s smooth and elastic. Let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>

        <li>Place a small amount of filling in the center of each circle. Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, then pinch the edges to seal.</li>
        <li>Bring the two ends of the half-moon together to form a ring, pressing gently to secure the shape.</li>
        <li>Cook the tortellini in boiling water for 3-5 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Serve with your favorite sauce and enjoy!</li>
