    <h1>Gluten Balls: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Gluten balls, also known as seitan, are a popular meat substitute made from wheat gluten. They are a staple in many vegetarian and vegan diets due to their high protein content and meat-like texture. In this article, we will explore the origins, nutritional benefits, culinary uses, and more about gluten balls. Whether you're a seasoned vegan or just curious about plant-based proteins, this guide will provide you with all the information you need.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gluten Balls?</h2>

This gluten is then cooked and often seasoned to create a chewy, protein-rich food that can be used in a variety of dishes. The process of making gluten balls is similar to that of making traditional wheat gluten, but the final product is shaped into balls or other forms for easier cooking and consumption.</p>
