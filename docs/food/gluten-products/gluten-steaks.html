<h1>Gluten Steaks: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Gluten steaks, also known as seitan steaks, have become a popular alternative to traditional meat steaks, especially among vegetarians, vegans, and those looking to reduce their meat consumption. Made from wheat gluten, these steaks offer a meaty texture and can be seasoned and cooked in a variety of ways to mimic the taste and feel of real steak.

<h2>What Are Gluten Steaks?</h2>

<p>Gluten steaks are a plant-based protein source made primarily from wheat gluten, the main protein found in wheat. When wheat flour is washed, the starch is removed, leaving behind a sticky, elastic mass of gluten. This gluten is then seasoned, shaped, and cooked to create a product that closely resembles the texture and appearance of meat. Gluten steaks are often used as a meat substitute in various dishes, offering a high-protein, low-fat alternative to traditional steaks.</p>

<h2>Nutritional Benefits of Gluten Steaks</h2>

<p>Gluten steaks are not only a great meat alternative but also offer several nutritional benefits. Here’s a breakdown of the key nutrients found in gluten steaks:</p>
