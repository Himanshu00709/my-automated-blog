    <h1>Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Foods: Your Ultimate Grocery List</h1>
    <p>Adopting a gluten-free and dairy-free diet can be a transformative experience for your health, especially if you have sensitivities, allergies, or intolerances to these common food groups. Whether you're managing celiac disease, lactose intolerance, or simply exploring a healthier lifestyle, having a well-curated grocery list is essential. This guide will walk you through the best gluten-free and dairy-free foods to stock up on, ensuring you never run out of delicious and nutritious options.</p>

    <h2>Why Go Gluten-Free and Dairy-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten and dairy are two of the most common allergens and intolerances worldwide. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause digestive issues, inflammation, and other health problems for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Dairy, on the other hand, contains lactose, a sugar that many people struggle to digest, leading to bloating, gas, and discomfort. By eliminating these from your diet, you may experience improved digestion, clearer skin, increased energy, and better overall health.</p>

    <h2>Essential Gluten-Free Dairy-Free Foods</h2>
    <p>When shopping for gluten-free and dairy-free foods, it's important to focus on whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive list of items to include in your grocery cart:</p>
