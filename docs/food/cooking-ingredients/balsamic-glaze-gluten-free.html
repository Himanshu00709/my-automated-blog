    <h1>Balsamic Glaze: A Gluten-Free Delight</h1>

    <p>Balsamic glaze, also known as balsamic reduction, is a versatile and flavorful condiment that has gained popularity in both gourmet cooking and everyday meals. Its rich, tangy, and slightly sweet flavor profile makes it a favorite among chefs and home cooks alike. For those following a gluten-free diet, balsamic glaze is often a safe and delicious option. In this article, we will explore what makes balsamic glaze gluten-free, its health benefits, and how you can incorporate it into your meals.</p>
