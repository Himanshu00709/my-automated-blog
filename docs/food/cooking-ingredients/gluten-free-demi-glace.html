<h1>Gluten-Free Demi-Glace: A Culinary Essential</h1>

<p>Demi-glace is a rich, velvety sauce that has been a cornerstone of French cuisine for centuries. Traditionally made from a reduction of veal stock and espagnole sauce, it is known for its deep, complex flavors that can elevate any dish.

<p>Creating a gluten-free demi-glace requires careful attention to detail, as the absence of gluten can affect the texture and consistency of the sauce. However, with the right techniques and ingredients, it is entirely possible to achieve a demi-glace that is both gluten-free and delicious.</p>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Stock:</strong> In a large pot, bring the gluten-free beef or veal stock to a simmer. Add the tomato paste, gluten-free soy sauce, thyme, and bay leaf. Stir to combine.</li>
    <li><strong>Simmer:</strong> Allow the mixture to simmer gently for about 2-3 hours, or until it has reduced by half. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li><strong>Thicken the Sauce:</strong> In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch or arrowroot powder with the cold water to create a slurry. Slowly whisk the slurry into the simmering stock, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduce Further:</strong> Continue to simmer the sauce until it reaches your desired consistency. The demi-glace should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.</li>
    <li><strong>Season:</strong> Taste the demi-glace and season with salt and pepper as needed. Remove the thyme sprigs and bay leaf before serving.</li>
