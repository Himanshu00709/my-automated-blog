    <h1>Gluten-Free Cajun Seasoning: A Flavorful Guide</h1>
    <p>Cajun seasoning is a staple in Southern cuisine, known for its bold, spicy, and smoky flavors. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a gluten-free version can be a challenge. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free Cajun seasoning, from its ingredients to its uses, and even how to make your own at home.</p>

    <h2>What is Cajun Seasoning?</h2>
    <p>Cajun seasoning is a blend of spices that originated in Louisiana, influenced by French, Spanish, and African culinary traditions.

The combination of these spices creates a complex flavor profile that is both spicy and savory, making it a versatile addition to many dishes.</p>

Many pre-packaged spice blends, including some Cajun seasonings, may contain gluten as a filler or anti-caking agent. Therefore, opting for a gluten-free version ensures that you can enjoy the bold flavors of Cajun cuisine without compromising your health.</p>
