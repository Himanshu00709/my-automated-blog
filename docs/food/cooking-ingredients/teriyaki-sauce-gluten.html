    <h1>Understanding Teriyaki Sauce and Gluten: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Teriyaki sauce is a staple in Japanese cuisine, known for its sweet and savory flavor profile. It’s commonly used as a marinade, glaze, or dipping sauce for a variety of dishes, from grilled meats to stir-fried vegetables. However, for individuals with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, the question of whether teriyaki sauce contains gluten is a critical one. In this article, we’ll explore the relationship between teriyaki sauce and gluten, discuss gluten-free alternatives, and provide tips for making informed dietary choices.</p>

    <h2>What is Teriyaki Sauce?</h2>

    <p>Teriyaki sauce is a Japanese condiment made from a combination of soy sauce, sugar, and mirin (a sweet rice wine). The sauce is typically thickened with cornstarch or another starch to achieve its signature glossy texture. The word "teriyaki" comes from the Japanese words "teri," meaning luster, and "yaki," meaning grilled or broiled. This reflects the sauce’s traditional use as a glaze for grilled meats and fish.</p>

    <p>While the basic ingredients of teriyaki sauce are simple, many commercial brands include additional ingredients such as garlic, ginger, and sesame oil to enhance the flavor. However, these additives can sometimes introduce gluten into the sauce, making it unsuitable for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <h2>Does Teriyaki Sauce Contain Gluten?</h2>

    <p>The primary ingredient in teriyaki sauce that raises concerns about gluten is soy sauce. Traditional soy sauce is made from fermented soybeans and wheat, which means it contains gluten. As a result, most conventional teriyaki sauces are not gluten-free. However, there are gluten-free soy sauce options available, and some brands produce gluten-free teriyaki sauce using these alternatives.</p>

    <p>It’s important to read the ingredient label carefully when purchasing teriyaki sauce. Look for products that explicitly state they are gluten-free. Additionally, be aware that even if a sauce is labeled as gluten-free, cross-contamination during manufacturing could still pose a risk for individuals with severe gluten intolerance or celiac disease.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Teriyaki Sauce Options</h2>

    <p>For those who need to avoid gluten, there are several options for enjoying teriyaki sauce without compromising your health:</p>
