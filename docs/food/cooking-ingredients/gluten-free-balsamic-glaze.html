<h1>Gluten-Free Balsamic Glaze: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>Balsamic glaze, also known as balsamic reduction, is a versatile and flavorful condiment that can elevate a wide range of dishes. From salads to roasted vegetables, and even desserts, this thick, syrupy sauce adds a touch of sophistication and depth to your culinary creations.
