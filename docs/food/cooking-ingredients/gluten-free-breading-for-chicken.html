    <h2>How to Make Gluten-Free Breading Stick to Chicken</h2>

    <p>One of the challenges of gluten-free breading is ensuring it adheres well to the chicken. Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect coating:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pat the Chicken Dry:</strong> Moisture is the enemy of breading. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels before applying any coating.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Binder:</strong> Eggs, buttermilk, or even a gluten-free yogurt can act as a binder to help the breading stick.</li>
        <li><strong>Double Coating:</strong> For extra crunch, consider double-coating the chicken. Dip it in the binder, then the breading, and repeat the process.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it Rest:</strong> Allow the breaded chicken to rest for 10-15 minutes before cooking. This helps the coating set and adhere better.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Breading Recipes</h2>
