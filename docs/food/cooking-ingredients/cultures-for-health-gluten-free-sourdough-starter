    <h1>Gluten-Free Sourdough Starter: A Guide by Cultures for Health</h1>

    <p>Sourdough bread has been a staple in many cultures for centuries, known for its tangy flavor and unique texture. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, traditional sourdough made from wheat flour is off the table. Enter gluten-free sourdough starter—a game-changer for those who want to enjoy the benefits of sourdough without the gluten. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free sourdough starters, focusing on the offerings from Cultures for Health, a trusted name in the world of fermentation and healthy living.</p>

    <h2>What is a Gluten-Free Sourdough Starter?</h2>

    <p>A gluten-free sourdough starter is a fermented mixture of gluten-free flour and water that captures wild yeast and beneficial bacteria from the environment. Unlike traditional sourdough starters, which are typically made with wheat or rye flour, gluten-free starters use flours like rice, buckwheat, or sorghum. This makes them safe for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.</p>

    <p>The process of creating a gluten-free sourdough starter is similar to that of a traditional starter. You mix flour and water, allow it to ferment, and feed it regularly to keep the culture alive. The result is a bubbly, tangy mixture that can be used to leaven gluten-free bread, pancakes, and other baked goods.</p>
