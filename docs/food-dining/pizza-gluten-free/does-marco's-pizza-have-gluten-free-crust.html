    <h1>Does Marco's Pizza Have Gluten-Free Crust? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding a safe and delicious pizza option can be a challenge. Marco's Pizza, a popular pizza chain known for its fresh ingredients and authentic Italian flavors, has been a go-to choice for many pizza lovers. But does Marco's Pizza offer a gluten-free crust? In this article, we'll explore everything you need to know about Marco's Pizza and its gluten-free options, including ingredients, preparation methods, and customer experiences.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

    <p>Before diving into Marco's Pizza's offerings, it's essential to understand what a gluten-free diet entails. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including damage to the small intestine. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, avoiding gluten is crucial to prevent symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue.</p>

    <p>When it comes to pizza, the crust is typically the primary source of gluten. Therefore, finding a pizza place that offers a gluten-free crust is vital for those who need to avoid gluten. Let's take a closer look at Marco's Pizza's gluten-free options.</p>

    <h2>Marco's Pizza Gluten-Free Crust: What You Need to Know</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients and Preparation</h3>

    <p>Marco's Pizza's gluten-free crust is made from a blend of rice flour, potato starch, and tapioca flour. These ingredients are naturally gluten-free, making the crust safe for individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, it's important to note that while the crust itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during the preparation process.</p>

    <p>Marco's Pizza takes precautions to minimize the risk of cross-contamination, such as using separate utensils and preparation areas. However, they do not have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen, so there is still a risk of trace amounts of gluten coming into contact with the gluten-free crust. If you have severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, it's essential to communicate your needs clearly when placing your order.</p>
