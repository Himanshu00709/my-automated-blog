    <h1>Gluten-Free Biscuits and Gravy: A Culinary Revolution</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by both medical necessity and lifestyle choices. Among the many gluten-free dishes gaining popularity, biscuits and gravy stand out as a comfort food classic that has been reimagined for the gluten-free community. This article delves into the world of gluten-free biscuits and gravy, exploring the ingredients, preparation methods, and the rise of dedicated gluten-free restaurants that cater to this growing niche.</p>

    <h2>The Rise of Gluten-Free Dining</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free dining is no longer a niche market. With the increasing prevalence of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity, restaurants are adapting to meet the needs of their customers. Gluten-free biscuits and gravy, once a rarity, are now a staple in many eateries. This shift is not just about accommodating dietary restrictions; it's about creating delicious, inclusive meals that everyone can enjoy.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Gluten-Free Biscuits and Gravy Unique?</h2>
    <p>Traditional biscuits and gravy rely heavily on wheat flour, which contains gluten. Gluten-free versions, however, use alternative flours such as almond flour, coconut flour, or a blend of gluten-free flours. These substitutes not only make the dish safe for those with gluten intolerance but also add unique flavors and textures. The gravy, typically made with a roux of flour and fat, is recreated using gluten-free thickeners like cornstarch or arrowroot powder.</p>

            <th>Gluten-Free Version</th>

        <tr>

            <td>Wheat Flour</td>
            <td>Almond Flour, Coconut Flour, or Gluten-Free Flour Blend</td>

            <td>Fat</td>

            <td>Butter or Dairy-Free Alternatives (e.g., Coconut Oil)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>The Art of Making Gluten-Free Biscuits</h2>
    <p>Creating the perfect gluten-free biscuit is both a science and an art. The absence of gluten, which provides structure and elasticity, means that gluten-free biscuits require careful balancing of ingredients to achieve the desired texture. Many recipes call for a combination of gluten-free flours, xanthan gum (to mimic the binding properties of gluten), and leavening agents like baking powder or baking soda. The result is a biscuit that is tender, flaky, and just as satisfying as its gluten-containing counterpart.</p>

    <h2>Crafting the Perfect Gluten-Free Gravy</h2>
    <p>The gravy is the heart of any biscuits and gravy dish, and gluten-free gravy is no exception. The key to a rich, flavorful gravy lies in the choice of thickener and the quality of the stock or broth used. Many chefs opt for a combination of cornstarch and chicken or vegetable stock, seasoned with herbs, spices, and a touch of cream or dairy-free milk. The result is a velvety, indulgent gravy that pairs perfectly with gluten-free biscuits.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Biscuits and Gravy Restaurants: A Growing Trend</h2>
    <p>As the demand for gluten-free options continues to grow, so too does the number of restaurants specializing in gluten-free cuisine. These establishments are not just catering to those with dietary restrictions; they are redefining what it means to enjoy comfort food. From cozy cafes to upscale eateries, gluten-free biscuits and gravy are becoming a menu staple, offering a taste of home without the gluten.</p>
