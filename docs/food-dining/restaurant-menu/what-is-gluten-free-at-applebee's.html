    <h2>Tips for Dining Gluten-Free at Applebee's</h2>

    <p>While Applebee's offers several gluten-free options, it’s essential to take precautions to ensure your meal is safe. Here are some tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Communicate with Your Server:</strong> Always inform your server about your gluten intolerance or celiac disease. They can guide you through the menu and alert the kitchen staff to take extra precautions.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask About Cross-Contamination:</strong> Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing ingredients. Ask if the kitchen uses separate utensils, cutting boards, and fryers for gluten-free items.</li>
        <li><strong>Double-Check Ingredients:</strong> Some dishes may appear gluten-free but could contain hidden gluten in sauces or marinades. Always ask for ingredient lists if you’re unsure.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider the Preparation Method:</strong> Grilled items are generally safer than fried ones, as fryers are often used for both gluten-free and gluten-containing foods.</li>
    </ul>
