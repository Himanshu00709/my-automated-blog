<h1>Gluten-Free Fried Seafood Restaurants: A Culinary Guide</h1>

<p>For seafood lovers with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a restaurant that offers gluten-free fried seafood can feel like discovering a hidden treasure. The crispy, golden exterior of fried seafood is a culinary delight, but traditional frying methods often rely on wheat-based batters. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free dining options has made it easier than ever to enjoy this beloved dish without compromising your health.
