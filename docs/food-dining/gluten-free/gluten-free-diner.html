    <h1>Gluten-Free Dining: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Gluten-free dining has become increasingly popular over the years, not only among those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity but also among individuals seeking a healthier lifestyle. Whether you're dining out or cooking at home, understanding the nuances of gluten-free eating is essential. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about gluten-free dining, from identifying safe foods to navigating restaurant menus.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even for those without celiac disease, gluten sensitivity can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. Going gluten-free can alleviate these symptoms and improve overall health.</p>
