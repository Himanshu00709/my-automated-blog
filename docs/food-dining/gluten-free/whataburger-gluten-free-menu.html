    <h1>Whataburger Gluten-Free Menu: A Detailed Guide</h1>
    <p>Whataburger, a beloved fast-food chain in the Southern United States, is known for its customizable burgers, fresh ingredients, and iconic orange-and-white striped A-frame buildings. For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can be a challenge. However, Whataburger offers several options that can be tailored to fit a gluten-free diet. In this guide, we’ll explore the gluten-free options available at Whataburger, how to order safely, and tips for navigating the menu.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining at Whataburger</h2>
    <p>Before diving into the menu, it’s important to understand that Whataburger is not a gluten-free restaurant. Cross-contamination is possible, as gluten-containing items are prepared in the same kitchen. However, with careful ordering and communication, you can enjoy a meal that minimizes the risk of gluten exposure.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Menu Options at Whataburger</h2>

    <h3>Burgers and Sandwiches</h3>
    <p>Most of Whataburger’s burgers and sandwiches are served on buns that contain gluten. However, you can order any burger or sandwich "protein style," which means it will be served without the bun and wrapped in lettuce. This is a great option for those avoiding gluten. Here are some popular choices:</p>

        <tr>
            <td>Side Salad</td>
            <td>A simple salad with lettuce, tomatoes, and other fresh veggies. Be cautious with dressings, as some may contain gluten.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Breakfast Options</h3>
    <p>Whataburger’s breakfast menu is a fan favorite, but many items contain gluten. However, you can still enjoy a gluten-free breakfast by ordering certain items without the bun or tortilla. Here are some options:</p>

            <td>Egg and Cheese Taquito</td>
            <td>Order without the tortilla for a gluten-free option.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Breakfast on a Bun</td>
            <td>Order protein style to avoid the gluten-containing bun.</td>
