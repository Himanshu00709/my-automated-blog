    <h1>Gluten-Free Mother's Day Brunch: A Delicious and Thoughtful Celebration</h1>
    <p>Mother's Day is a special occasion to honor the incredible women in our lives, and what better way to show your love than by preparing a delicious and thoughtful gluten-free brunch? Whether your mom follows a gluten-free diet due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal preference, this guide will help you create a memorable and safe dining experience. From mouthwatering recipes to practical tips, we’ve got you covered for a stress-free and delightful celebration.</p>

    <h2>Why a Gluten-Free Brunch?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free diets have become increasingly popular, and for good reason. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues. Even for those without these conditions, many people find that reducing gluten in their diet can improve digestion and overall well-being. By hosting a gluten-free brunch, you’re not only catering to dietary needs but also showing your mom that you care about her health and happiness.</p>

    <h2>Planning Your Gluten-Free Mother's Day Brunch</h2>
    <p>Planning a gluten-free brunch doesn’t have to be complicated. With a little preparation and creativity, you can create a spread that’s both delicious and safe for everyone to enjoy. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p>

    <h3>1. Choose Gluten-Free Ingredients</h3>
    <p>When planning your menu, it’s essential to select ingredients that are naturally gluten-free or certified gluten-free. Common gluten-free staples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh fruits and vegetables</li>
        <li>Lean proteins like eggs, chicken, and fish</li>
        <li>Gluten-free grains such as quinoa, rice, and oats (certified gluten-free)</li>
        <li>Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Avoid Cross-Contamination</h3>
    <p>Cross-contamination is a significant concern for those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance. To prevent this, use separate utensils, cutting boards, and cookware for gluten-free items. Additionally, thoroughly clean all surfaces before preparing your meal.</p>

    <h3>3. Create a Balanced Menu</h3>
    <p>A well-rounded brunch menu should include a mix of sweet and savory dishes, as well as beverages. Here’s a sample menu to inspire you:</p>
