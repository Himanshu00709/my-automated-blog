    <li><strong>Separate Utensils:</strong> Ensure that the chef uses separate utensils for your meal to avoid mixing with gluten-containing foods.</li>
    <li><strong>Double-Check Ingredients:</strong> Always verify that the ingredients in your dish are gluten-free, especially when it comes to sauces and marinades.</li>
</ul>
