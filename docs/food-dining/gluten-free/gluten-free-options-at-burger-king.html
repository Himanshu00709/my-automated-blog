    <h1>Gluten-Free Options at Burger King: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, fast-food chains like Burger King have started to recognize the importance of offering gluten-free options to cater to this growing demographic. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free options available at Burger King, how to order safely, and what to be cautious about when dining at this popular fast-food chain.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe digestive issues, nutrient malabsorption, and long-term health complications. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten can cause discomfort and other symptoms. Therefore, it’s crucial for these individuals to have access to safe, gluten-free dining options.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Options at Burger King</h2>

    <p>Burger King has made strides in offering gluten-free options, but it’s important to note that their kitchens are not entirely gluten-free. Cross-contamination is a significant concern, so those with severe gluten intolerance should proceed with caution. Below is a list of gluten-free items available at Burger King:</p>
