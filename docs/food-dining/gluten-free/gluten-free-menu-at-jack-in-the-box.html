    <h1>Gluten-Free Menu at Jack in the Box: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. The risk of cross-contamination and the limited availability of gluten-free options can make fast food restaurants seem off-limits. However, Jack in the Box, a popular fast-food chain, has made strides in accommodating gluten-free diets. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free options available at Jack in the Box, discuss cross-contamination risks, and provide tips for safely enjoying your meal.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial for individuals on a gluten-free diet to be vigilant about the foods they consume, especially when dining out.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Options at Jack in the Box</h2>

    <p>While Jack in the Box does not have a dedicated gluten-free menu, there are several menu items that are naturally gluten-free or can be modified to fit a gluten-free diet. Below is a table outlining some of the gluten-free options available:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Menu Item</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Side Salad</td>
                <td>A fresh mix of lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Be sure to skip the croutons and choose a gluten-free dressing.</td>
                <td>Gluten-Free (with modifications)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Grilled Chicken Strips</td>
                <td>Grilled chicken strips without any breading. Pair with a side of ranch dressing (check for gluten-free status).</td>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

    <p>One of the biggest challenges for gluten-free diners at fast-food restaurants is the risk of cross-contamination. Even if a menu item is naturally gluten-free, it can come into contact with gluten during preparation. At Jack in the Box, cross-contamination is a concern, especially in the fryers where gluten-containing items like French fries and chicken nuggets are cooked. To minimize the risk, consider the following tips:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> Don’t hesitate to ask the staff about their preparation methods and whether they can accommodate gluten-free requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Grilled Over Fried:</strong> Opt for grilled items like chicken strips instead of fried options to avoid cross-contamination in the fryer.</li>
        <li><strong>Skip the Bun:</strong> If you’re ordering a burger, ask for it without the bun or bring your own gluten-free bun.</li>
    </ul>
