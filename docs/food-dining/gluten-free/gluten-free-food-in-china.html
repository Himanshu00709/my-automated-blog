    <h3>Vegetable and Meat Dishes</h3>

    <p>Stir-fried vegetables, steamed fish, and grilled meats are often gluten-free. However, it's essential to ask about the ingredients used in marinades and sauces, as they may contain soy sauce or other gluten-containing additives.</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Noodles</h3>

    <p>While wheat noodles are common, there are gluten-free alternatives made from rice, mung bean, or sweet potato starch. These noodles are often used in dishes like rice noodle soup or stir-fried rice noodles.</p>
