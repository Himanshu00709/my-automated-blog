<h2>How Applebee's Handles Cross-Contamination</h2>

<p>Cross-contamination is a significant concern for individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity. Applebee's acknowledges that while they take precautions to avoid cross-contamination, their kitchens are not entirely gluten-free.

<p>To minimize this risk, Applebee's recommends that customers inform their server about their gluten sensitivity or celiac disease. The staff is trained to take extra precautions, such as using separate utensils and preparation areas when possible. However, it’s crucial to understand that these measures may not completely eliminate the risk of cross-contamination.</p>

<h2>Tips for Dining Gluten-Free at Applebee's</h2>

<p>If you’re planning to dine at Applebee's and need to stick to a gluten-free diet, here are some tips to ensure a safer dining experience:</p>

<ul>
