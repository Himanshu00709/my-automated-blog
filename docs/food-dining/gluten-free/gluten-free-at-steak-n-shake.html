    <ul>
        <li><strong>Steakburger:</strong> A classic beef patty with your choice of toppings.</li>
        <li><strong>Double Steakburger:</strong> Two beef patties for those with a bigger appetite.</li>
        <li><strong>Bacon 'n Cheese Steakburger:</strong> A delicious combination of beef, bacon, and cheese.</li>
    </ul>
