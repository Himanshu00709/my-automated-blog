<h1>Does Arby's Have Gluten-Free Items? A Detailed Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can be a challenge. Fast food restaurants, in particular, often rely on gluten-containing ingredients, making it difficult to find safe options. Arby's, known for its roast beef sandwiches and curly fries, is a popular fast-food chain. But does Arby's have gluten-free items? In this article, we’ll explore Arby's menu, discuss gluten-free options, and provide tips for safely navigating their offerings.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. Even small amounts of gluten can trigger symptoms, so it’s crucial for those affected to avoid cross-contamination and carefully select their food.</p>

<h2>Arby's Menu: A Gluten-Free Perspective</h2>

<p>Arby's is famous for its meat-centric menu, including roast beef, turkey, and ham sandwiches. However, most of their signature items contain gluten due to the bread, buns, and sauces used. That said, Arby's does offer a few gluten-free options, though they are limited. Below is a breakdown of Arby's menu items and their gluten-free status:</p>

<ul>
