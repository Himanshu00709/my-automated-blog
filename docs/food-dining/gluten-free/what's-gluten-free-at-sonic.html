<h1>What's Gluten-Free at Sonic? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. With so many hidden sources of gluten in restaurant menus, it's crucial to know exactly what you can safely eat. Sonic Drive-In, known for its extensive menu of burgers, hot dogs, and milkshakes, may not seem like the most gluten-free-friendly option at first glance. However, with a little knowledge and careful selection, you can still enjoy a meal at Sonic without compromising your health. In this guide, we'll explore the gluten-free options available at Sonic, provide tips for ordering safely, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten triggers an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to a host of symptoms and long-term health complications. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, ingesting gluten can cause discomfort, bloating, and other digestive issues. Therefore, it's essential to identify and avoid gluten-containing foods when dining out.</p>

<p>While Sonic's traditional burgers and sandwiches are not gluten-free due to the buns, you can still enjoy a burger by ordering it without the bun. Sonic offers lettuce wraps as an alternative, allowing you to enjoy the flavors of a burger without the gluten. Be sure to specify that you need a gluten-free option when ordering to avoid cross-contamination.</p>
