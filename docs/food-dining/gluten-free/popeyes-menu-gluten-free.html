    <h1>Popeyes Menu Gluten-Free Options: A Detailed Guide</h1>
    <p>Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen is a beloved fast-food chain known for its flavorful fried chicken, Cajun-inspired dishes, and mouthwatering sides. However, for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, navigating the menu can be a challenge.
