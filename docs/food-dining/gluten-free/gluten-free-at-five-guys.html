<h1>Gluten-Free at Five Guys: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, Five Guys, the popular burger chain, has become a go-to spot for many gluten-free diners. Known for their customizable burgers and fresh ingredients, Five Guys offers a variety of options that cater to gluten-free diets. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about enjoying a gluten-free meal at Five Guys, from menu options to cross-contamination concerns.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining</h2>

<p>Before diving into the specifics of Five Guys’ menu, it’s important to understand what it means to dine gluten-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it’s crucial to ensure that the food you consume is free from gluten and that there’s no risk of cross-contamination during preparation.</p>

<h2>Five Guys’ Gluten-Free Options</h2>

<p>Five Guys is known for its simple yet delicious menu, which primarily consists of burgers, hot dogs, fries, and milkshakes. While the restaurant doesn’t offer gluten-free buns, there are still plenty of options for those avoiding gluten. Here’s a breakdown of what you can enjoy:</p>

<h3>Burgers</h3>

<p>Five Guys’ burgers are made with 100% fresh beef and are free from fillers, preservatives, and artificial flavors. While the standard burger buns contain gluten, you can opt for a lettuce wrap instead. This allows you to enjoy the same juicy patty and toppings without the gluten. Popular toppings like cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and onions are all gluten-free, but be sure to avoid any sauces or toppings that may contain gluten.</p>

<h3>Hot Dogs</h3>

<p>Five Guys’ hot dogs are another option for gluten-free diners. Like the burgers, the hot dog buns contain gluten, but you can request a lettuce wrap or enjoy the hot dog without a bun. The hot dogs themselves are gluten-free, and you can customize them with a variety of toppings, just like the burgers.</p>

<h3>Fries</h3>

<p>One of the highlights of Five Guys’ menu is their famous fries. Made from fresh, hand-cut potatoes and cooked in 100% peanut oil, the fries are naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that Five Guys fries their fries in the same oil as other items that may contain gluten, such as their Cajun seasoning. If you have a severe gluten allergy, it’s best to consult with the staff to ensure that the fries are safe for you to consume.</p>

<h3>Milkshakes</h3>

<p>Five Guys’ milkshakes are a popular treat, and the good news is that they are gluten-free. Made with real ice cream and a variety of mix-ins, the milkshakes are a safe and delicious option for those avoiding gluten. Just be sure to avoid any mix-ins that may contain gluten, such as certain cookies or candies.</p>

<h2>Cross-Contamination Concerns</h2>

<p>While Five Guys offers several gluten-free options, cross-contamination is a potential concern. Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free foods come into contact with surfaces, utensils, or oils that have been used to prepare gluten-containing foods. Here are some steps you can take to minimize the risk:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Communicate with Staff:</strong> Inform the staff about your gluten-free needs and ask them to take extra precautions when preparing your food.</li>
    <li><strong>Request Fresh Gloves:</strong> Ask the staff to change their gloves before handling your food to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid Shared Fryers:</strong> If you’re concerned about cross-contamination with the fries, ask if they can prepare a fresh batch in a clean fryer.</li>
</ul>
