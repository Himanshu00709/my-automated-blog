    <h1>Capriotti's Gluten-Free Menu: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, Capriotti's Sandwich Shop has made it their mission to provide delicious, gluten-free options that don't compromise on taste or quality.

As a result, restaurants offering gluten-free options must take extra care in food preparation to avoid cross-contamination.</p>
