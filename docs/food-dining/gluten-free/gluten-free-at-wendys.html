    <h1>Gluten-Free Options at Wendy's: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, fast-food chains like Wendy's have made strides in offering gluten-free options to cater to this growing demographic. In this article, we'll explore the gluten-free menu at Wendy's, discuss cross-contamination risks, and provide tips for safely enjoying your meal.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it's crucial to identify safe food options when dining out.</p>

    <h2>Wendy's Gluten-Free Menu Options</h2>
    <p>Wendy's offers several menu items that are naturally gluten-free. However, it's important to note that Wendy's does not have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen, so cross-contamination is a possibility. Here are some of the gluten-free options available:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Menu Item</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Baked Potato</td>
                <td>A plain baked potato without any toppings. You can add butter, sour cream, or chives, but be cautious with cheese and bacon bits, as they may contain gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Chili</td>
                <td>Wendy's chili is gluten-free and can be enjoyed on its own or as a topping for a baked potato.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Side Salad</td>
                <td>A simple side salad with lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Be sure to avoid croutons and certain dressings that may contain gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Frosty</td>
                <td>Wendy's famous Frosty dessert is gluten-free and a safe treat for those avoiding gluten.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>
    <p>While Wendy's offers gluten-free options, it's essential to be aware of the risk of cross-contamination. Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods or surfaces. For example, fries at Wendy's are cooked in the same oil as breaded items, which means they are not gluten-free. Always inform the staff of your dietary restrictions and ask about their preparation methods to minimize risks.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Ordering Gluten-Free at Wendy's</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to help you safely enjoy a gluten-free meal at Wendy's:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Communicate Clearly:</strong> Inform the staff about your gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Ask them to change gloves and use clean utensils to prepare your food.</li>
        <li><strong>Stick to Simple Options:</strong> Choose menu items that are naturally gluten-free, such as a baked potato or chili.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Fried Foods:</strong> Fried items are often cooked in shared oil, which can lead to cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Ingredients:</strong> Always double-check the ingredients of sauces, dressings, and toppings to ensure they are gluten-free.</li>
    </ul>
