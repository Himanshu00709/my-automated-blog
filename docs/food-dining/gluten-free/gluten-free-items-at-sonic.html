    <h1>Gluten-Free Options at Sonic: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, Sonic Drive-In, a popular fast-food chain known for its retro vibe and extensive menu, has made strides in offering gluten-free options. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free items available at Sonic, provide tips for safe dining, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining at Sonic</h2>

    <p>Before diving into the menu, it’s important to understand what "gluten-free" means in the context of fast food. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, even trace amounts of gluten can cause severe health issues. While Sonic does not have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen, they do offer several menu items that are naturally gluten-free or can be modified to avoid gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Menu Items at Sonic</h2>

    <p>Below is a list of gluten-free items available at Sonic. Please note that cross-contamination is always a risk in fast-food environments, so it’s essential to communicate your dietary needs clearly when ordering.</p>
