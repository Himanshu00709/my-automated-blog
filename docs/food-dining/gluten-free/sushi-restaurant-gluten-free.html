    <h1>Gluten-Free Sushi: A Guide to Safe and Delicious Dining</h1>
    <p>Sushi is a beloved culinary art form that has captured the hearts of food enthusiasts worldwide. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying sushi can be a daunting task. Traditional sushi often contains ingredients like soy sauce, imitation crab, and certain types of vinegar that may contain gluten. Fortunately, with the rise of gluten-free awareness, many sushi restaurants now offer gluten-free options that allow everyone to enjoy this exquisite cuisine without worry. In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about gluten-free sushi, from what to look for on the menu to how to ensure a safe dining experience.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten in Sushi</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It’s commonly present in soy sauce, which is a staple condiment in sushi. Additionally, some sushi ingredients, such as imitation crab (made from processed fish and wheat starch), tempura batter, and certain types of vinegar, may contain gluten. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, even trace amounts of gluten can cause adverse reactions. Therefore, it’s crucial to understand which sushi ingredients are safe and which ones to avoid.</p>

    <h2>How to Order Gluten-Free Sushi</h2>
    <p>When dining at a sushi restaurant, it’s essential to communicate your dietary needs clearly to the staff. Here are some tips to ensure a safe and enjoyable gluten-free sushi experience:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ask About Gluten-Free Options:</strong> Many sushi restaurants now offer gluten-free menus or can modify dishes to accommodate gluten-free diets. Don’t hesitate to ask the staff for recommendations.</li>
        <li><strong>Request Gluten-Free Soy Sauce:</strong> Traditional soy sauce contains gluten, but many restaurants offer gluten-free alternatives like tamari. Always confirm that the soy sauce is gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Cross-Contamination:</strong> Cross-contamination can occur if gluten-free sushi is prepared on the same surface or with the same utensils as gluten-containing items. Request that your sushi be prepared separately to avoid any risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Stick to Simple Rolls:</strong> Opt for sushi rolls with fewer ingredients, such as sashimi (raw fish) or nigiri (fish over rice). These are less likely to contain hidden sources of gluten.</li>
