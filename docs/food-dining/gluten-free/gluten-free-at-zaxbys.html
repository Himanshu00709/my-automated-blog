<h1>Gluten-Free Options at Zaxby's: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, with the growing awareness of gluten-related health issues, many restaurants, including Zaxby's, have started to offer gluten-free options. In this article, we'll explore the gluten-free offerings at Zaxby's, provide tips for safely ordering, and answer some frequently asked questions about gluten-free dining at this popular fast-food chain.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it's crucial for individuals with these conditions to avoid gluten in their diet.</p>

<p>When dining out, cross-contamination is a significant concern. Even if a dish is inherently gluten-free, it can become contaminated if it comes into contact with gluten-containing ingredients during preparation. This is why it's essential to understand not only the ingredients but also the preparation methods used by the restaurant.</p>
