    <h1>Gluten-Free Options at A&W: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the general public's interest in healthier eating habits. A&W, a beloved fast-food chain known for its root beer and classic burgers, has not been left behind in this trend. This article delves into the gluten-free offerings at A&W, providing a detailed guide for those who need or prefer to avoid gluten in their diet.</p>

As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to improve their health and well-being.</p>

    <p>Fast-food chains like A&W have recognized this shift and have started offering gluten-free options to cater to this growing demographic. However, it's essential to understand that cross-contamination can still occur in kitchens that handle gluten-containing products, so those with severe gluten intolerance should exercise caution.</p>
