    <h1>Five Guys Burgers and Fries: A Gluten-Free Guide</h1>

    <p>Five Guys Burgers and Fries has become a staple in the fast-food industry, known for its customizable burgers, fresh ingredients, and generous portions. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, navigating the menu can be a challenge. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore how Five Guys caters to gluten-free diets, what options are available, and tips for ensuring a safe and enjoyable dining experience.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining at Five Guys</h2>

    <p>Five Guys is not a dedicated gluten-free restaurant, but they do offer several options that can be adapted for those avoiding gluten. The key to a successful gluten-free meal at Five Guys lies in understanding the menu and communicating your dietary needs clearly to the staff. Here’s what you need to know:</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Burger Options</h3>

    <p>Five Guys offers a unique solution for gluten-free diners: the lettuce wrap. Instead of a traditional bun, your burger can be served wrapped in fresh, crisp lettuce. This option allows you to enjoy the same juicy, flavorful burgers without the gluten. Here’s a breakdown of the gluten-free burger options:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Burger Type</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Option</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Hamburger</td>
                <td>Lettuce Wrap</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cheeseburger</td>
                <td>Lettuce Wrap</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Bacon Burger</td>
                <td>Lettuce Wrap</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Bacon Cheeseburger</td>
                <td>Lettuce Wrap</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>All of Five Guys’ burgers are made with 100% fresh beef, and you can customize your toppings to suit your preferences. Just be sure to avoid any toppings that may contain gluten, such as certain sauces or seasonings.</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Fries</h3>

    <p>One of the highlights of Five Guys is their famous fries. The good news for gluten-free diners is that Five Guys fries are cooked in 100% peanut oil, which is naturally gluten-free. However, it’s important to note that the fries are cooked in the same fryers as other items that may contain gluten, so there is a risk of cross-contamination. If you have a severe gluten allergy or celiac disease, you may want to exercise caution.</p>

    <h3>Other Gluten-Free Options</h3>

    <p>In addition to burgers and fries, Five Guys offers a few other gluten-free options:</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for a Safe Gluten-Free Experience</h2>

    <p>While Five Guys offers several gluten-free options, it’s important to take precautions to avoid cross-contamination. Here are some tips to ensure a safe dining experience:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Communicate Clearly:</strong> Inform the staff about your gluten-free needs and ask them to change gloves and use clean utensils when preparing your meal.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Shared Fryers:</strong> If you’re highly sensitive to gluten, consider skipping the fries or asking if they can be cooked in a separate fryer.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Ingredients:</strong> Always double-check the ingredients of any sauces or toppings to ensure they are gluten-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Use the Five Guys App:</strong> The Five Guys app allows you to customize your order and specify dietary restrictions, making it easier to order gluten-free meals.</li>
