    <h1>Wendy's Gluten-Free Options: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, Wendy's has made strides in offering gluten-free options that cater to those who need to avoid gluten. In this article, we'll explore Wendy's gluten-free menu, discuss cross-contamination risks, and provide tips for safely enjoying your meal at Wendy's.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including damage to the small intestine. Even those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity may experience symptoms like bloating, headaches, and fatigue after consuming gluten. Therefore, it's crucial for these individuals to have access to safe, gluten-free dining options.</p>

    <h2>Wendy's Gluten-Free Menu Items</h2>
    <p>Wendy's offers several menu items that are naturally gluten-free. However, it's important to note that Wendy's does not have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen, so cross-contamination is a possibility. Here are some of the gluten-free options available at Wendy's:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Menu Item</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Baked Potato</td>
                <td>A plain baked potato with no toppings is a safe gluten-free option. You can add butter, sour cream, or chives, but avoid any toppings that contain gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Chili</td>
                <td>Wendy's chili is gluten-free and can be a hearty option for those avoiding gluten. It's made with ground beef, beans, and a blend of spices.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salads (without croutons)</td>
                <td>Several of Wendy's salads can be made gluten-free by omitting the croutons. Be sure to check the dressing for any hidden gluten.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Frosty</td>
                <td>Wendy's famous Frosty dessert is gluten-free, making it a safe treat for those avoiding gluten.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>
    <p>While Wendy's offers gluten-free options, it's important to be aware of the risk of cross-contamination. Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods or surfaces. At Wendy's, this could happen in the kitchen where gluten-free items are prepared alongside gluten-containing items like buns and breaded chicken.</p>

    <p>To minimize the risk of cross-contamination, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask the staff to change gloves before preparing your order.</li>
        <li>Request that your food be prepared in a clean area of the kitchen.</li>
        <li>Avoid fried items, as they may be cooked in the same oil as gluten-containing foods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for Dining Gluten-Free at Wendy's</h2>
    <p>Dining out gluten-free requires a bit of planning and communication. Here are some tips to help you enjoy a safe and satisfying meal at Wendy's:</p>
