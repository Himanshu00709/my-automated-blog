    <h1>Does Texas Roadhouse Have a Gluten-Free Menu?</h1>

    <p>Texas Roadhouse is a popular American restaurant chain known for its hand-cut steaks, fall-off-the-bone ribs, and made-from-scratch sides. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can be a challenge. The question many people ask is: <strong>Does Texas Roadhouse have a gluten-free menu?</strong> In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free options available at Texas Roadhouse, how to navigate the menu, and what you need to know to enjoy a safe and delicious meal.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining</h2>

    <p>Before diving into the specifics of Texas Roadhouse’s menu, it’s important to understand what gluten-free dining entails. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. As a result, many restaurants have started offering gluten-free options to cater to this growing demographic.</p>

    <p>However, cross-contamination is a significant concern in restaurants that serve both gluten-free and gluten-containing foods. Even a small amount of gluten can cause a reaction in sensitive individuals. Therefore, it’s crucial for restaurants to have strict protocols in place to prevent cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Texas Roadhouse’s Gluten-Free Options</h2>

    <p>Texas Roadhouse does not have a dedicated gluten-free menu, but they do offer a variety of gluten-free options. The restaurant provides a <strong>Gluten-Free Guide</strong> on their website, which lists the menu items that are free from gluten-containing ingredients. However, it’s important to note that Texas Roadhouse cannot guarantee that cross-contamination will not occur, as they prepare and cook gluten-free items in the same kitchen as gluten-containing foods.</p>

    <p>Here’s a breakdown of some gluten-free options available at Texas Roadhouse:</p>
