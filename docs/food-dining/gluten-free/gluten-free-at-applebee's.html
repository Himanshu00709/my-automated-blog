    <p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply choosing a gluten-free lifestyle, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield.

    <p>It's important to note that while these items are listed as gluten-free, cross-contamination can still occur in the kitchen. Always inform your server of your dietary restrictions to ensure they take the necessary precautions.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Concerns</h2>

    <p>Cross-contamination is a significant concern for those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity. This occurs when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods or surfaces.

    <p>To minimize this risk, Applebee's recommends that customers inform their server of their gluten-free needs. The staff is trained to take extra precautions, such as using separate utensils and preparation areas. However, it's essential to understand that absolute prevention cannot be guaranteed.</p>

    <h2>Tips for a Safe Gluten-Free Dining Experience</h2>

    <p>Here are some tips to help you enjoy a safe and enjoyable gluten-free meal at Applebee's:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Communicate Clearly:</strong> Always inform your server about your gluten-free requirements. Be specific about your needs and ask questions about how the food is prepared.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the Menu:</strong> Review the gluten-free menu options online or ask for a gluten-free menu at the restaurant.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Fried Foods:</strong> Fried foods are often cooked in shared fryers, which can lead to cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask About Sauces and Dressings:</strong> Many sauces and dressings contain gluten. Always ask for gluten-free options or request that your meal be prepared without them.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider the Time of Day:</strong> Dining during off-peak hours may reduce the risk of cross-contamination, as the kitchen is less busy.</li>
