    <h1>Red Lobster and Gluten-Free Dining: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For seafood lovers with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, Red Lobster, one of America's most beloved seafood chains, has made significant strides in accommodating gluten-free diets. In this article, we’ll explore how Red Lobster caters to gluten-free diners, highlight safe menu options, and provide tips for ensuring a safe and enjoyable dining experience.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining at Red Lobster</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free dining is not just a trend; it’s a necessity for millions of people worldwide.

    <p>Red Lobster’s gluten-free menu is designed to offer a variety of choices, from appetizers to desserts. However, it’s important to note that while the restaurant takes precautions to avoid cross-contamination, the risk cannot be entirely eliminated in a shared kitchen environment. Always inform your server about your dietary restrictions to ensure they take extra care when preparing your meal.</p>
