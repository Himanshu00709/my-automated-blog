<h1>Sonic Drive-In Gluten-Free Menu: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, Sonic Drive-In, a beloved fast-food chain known for its retro drive-in experience, has made strides in offering gluten-free options. While Sonic is not a gluten-free restaurant, it does provide several menu items that can be customized to fit a gluten-free diet.
