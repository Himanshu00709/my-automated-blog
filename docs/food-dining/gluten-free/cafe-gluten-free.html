    <h1>Café Gluten-Free: A Guide to Delicious and Safe Dining</h1>

    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by the growing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the general public's interest in healthier eating habits. Cafés have responded to this trend by offering a variety of gluten-free dishes, ensuring that everyone can enjoy a delicious meal without compromising their health. This article delves into the world of gluten-free cafés, exploring what makes them unique, the benefits they offer, and how to navigate their menus with confidence.</p>

    <h2>What is Gluten and Why Go Gluten-Free?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, it can cause severe health issues. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Symptoms can range from digestive problems to fatigue, skin rashes, and even neurological issues. Gluten sensitivity, on the other hand, may cause similar symptoms but without the intestinal damage seen in celiac disease.</p>

    <p>Going gluten-free is not just a dietary choice for many; it's a necessity. However, it’s also a lifestyle that has gained popularity among those seeking to improve their overall health, reduce inflammation, or simply explore new culinary horizons.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free cafés often pride themselves on using high-quality, whole ingredients. From gluten-free flours like almond, coconut, and rice flour to naturally gluten-free grains like quinoa and buckwheat, these cafés are redefining what it means to eat gluten-free. They also focus on creating dishes that are not only safe but also flavorful and satisfying, proving that gluten-free dining can be just as enjoyable as traditional dining.</p>
