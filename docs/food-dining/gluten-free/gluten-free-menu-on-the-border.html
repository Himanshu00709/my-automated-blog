    <h1>Exploring the Gluten-Free Menu at On The Border</h1>
    <p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, many restaurants are now offering gluten-free options to cater to this growing demographic. On The Border, a popular Tex-Mex restaurant chain, is no exception. In this blog post, we’ll take a deep dive into the gluten-free menu at On The Border, exploring the options available, the precautions taken to avoid cross-contamination, and what you can expect when dining there.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining</h2>
    <p>Before we delve into the specifics of On The Border’s gluten-free offerings, it’s important to understand what gluten-free dining entails. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause serious health issues for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. For these individuals, consuming gluten can lead to symptoms ranging from digestive discomfort to severe autoimmune reactions. Therefore, it’s crucial for restaurants to not only offer gluten-free options but also to ensure that these options are prepared in a way that minimizes the risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>On The Border’s Gluten-Free Menu</h2>
    <p>On The Border has made significant strides in accommodating gluten-free diners. Their gluten-free menu is designed to provide a variety of options that cater to different tastes and dietary needs. Below, we’ll break down some of the key categories on the gluten-free menu.</p>

    <h3>Appetizers</h3>
    <p>Starting your meal with an appetizer is a great way to set the tone for your dining experience. On The Border offers several gluten-free appetizers, including their famous Guacamole Live! and the Border Sampler, which features a selection of gluten-free dips and chips. It’s important to note that while the chips are made from corn and are naturally gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur if they are fried in the same oil as gluten-containing items. Always inform your server of your dietary restrictions to ensure proper handling.</p>

    <h3>Entrees</h3>
    <p>When it comes to entrees, On The Border offers a range of gluten-free options that are both flavorful and satisfying. Some of the standout dishes include the Grilled Chicken Tacos, the Steak Fajitas, and the Shrimp Diablo. Each of these dishes is prepared with gluten-free ingredients, but it’s essential to communicate your dietary needs to your server to ensure that the kitchen takes the necessary precautions to avoid cross-contamination.</p>

    <h3>Desserts</h3>
    <p>No meal is complete without a sweet ending, and On The Border doesn’t disappoint. Their gluten-free dessert options include the Tres Leches Cake and the Flan. Both of these desserts are made without gluten-containing ingredients, but as always, it’s a good idea to double-check with your server to ensure that they are prepared in a gluten-free environment.</p>

    <h2>Precautions and Cross-Contamination</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest concerns for gluten-free diners is the risk of cross-contamination. Even if a dish is made with gluten-free ingredients, it can still come into contact with gluten during preparation, cooking, or serving. On The Border takes several precautions to minimize this risk, including using separate cooking utensils and preparation areas for gluten-free dishes. However, it’s always a good idea to inform your server of your dietary restrictions and ask about the specific precautions taken in the kitchen.</p>
