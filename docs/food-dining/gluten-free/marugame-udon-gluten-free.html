    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it's crucial to identify gluten-free options when dining out, especially at restaurants like Marugame Udon, where traditional udon noodles are made from wheat flour.</p>

    <h2>Marugame Udon's Gluten-Free Offerings</h2>

    <p>While Marugame Udon is primarily known for its wheat-based udon noodles, the restaurant has made efforts to accommodate gluten-free diners. Here’s a breakdown of the gluten-free options available:</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Broths</h3>

    <p>The broths at Marugame Udon are typically made from a combination of dashi (a Japanese stock), soy sauce, and other seasonings. While some broths may contain gluten due to the use of soy sauce, Marugame Udon offers gluten-free broth options. These broths are made with tamari, a gluten-free soy sauce alternative, ensuring that they are safe for gluten-sensitive individuals.</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Toppings</h3>

    <p>Marugame Udon provides a variety of gluten-free toppings, including fresh vegetables, tofu, and certain proteins like chicken and beef.
