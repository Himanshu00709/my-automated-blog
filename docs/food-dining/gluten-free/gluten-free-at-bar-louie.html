As a result, gluten-free dining is not just a trend but a necessity for many.</p>

    <p>Bar Louie recognizes the importance of catering to this dietary need and has made significant efforts to ensure that their gluten-free options are safe, delicious, and satisfying. From appetizers to desserts, there's something for everyone.</p>
