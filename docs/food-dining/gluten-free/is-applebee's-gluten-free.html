    <h1>Is Applebee's Gluten-Free? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. With the increasing awareness of gluten-related health issues, many restaurants have started offering gluten-free options. Applebee's, a popular American casual dining chain, is no exception. But how gluten-free-friendly is Applebee's? In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free options available at Applebee's, how they handle cross-contamination, and what you need to know before dining there.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe health complications, including damage to the small intestine. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten can cause discomfort and digestive issues. As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to manage their health. However, finding safe and delicious gluten-free options at restaurants can be challenging.</p>

    <h2>Applebee's Gluten-Free Menu Options</h2>
    <p>Applebee's has made efforts to accommodate gluten-free diners by offering a variety of menu items that are free from gluten-containing ingredients. However, it’s important to note that while these items are prepared without gluten, cross-contamination can still occur in the kitchen. Here’s a breakdown of some gluten-free options available at Applebee's:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Category</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Options</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Appetizers</td>
                <td>Spinach & Artichoke Dip (without bread), Chicken Wonton Tacos (without wonton strips)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Salads</td>
                <td>Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad (without croutons), Oriental Chicken Salad (without crispy noodles)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Entrees</td>
                <td>Grilled Chicken Breast, 7 oz. Top Sirloin, Double-Glazed Baby Back Ribs</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sides</td>
                <td>Steamed Broccoli, Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Green Beans</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Desserts</td>
                <td>None (most desserts contain gluten)</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>While this list provides a good starting point, it’s always a good idea to check with your server about the latest gluten-free options and any potential cross-contamination risks.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Concerns at Applebee's</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest challenges for gluten-free diners is the risk of cross-contamination. Even if a dish is made without gluten-containing ingredients, it can still come into contact with gluten during preparation. Applebee's has stated that they take precautions to minimize cross-contamination, but they cannot guarantee that any menu item is 100% gluten-free. This is because their kitchens are not dedicated gluten-free environments, and shared cooking surfaces, utensils, and fryers are used.</p>

    <p>If you have a severe gluten allergy or celiac disease, it’s crucial to communicate your dietary needs clearly to your server. They can inform the kitchen staff to take extra precautions, such as using separate utensils and cleaning surfaces thoroughly before preparing your meal.</p>
