<p>To minimize this risk, it's important to communicate your dietary needs to the restaurant staff. Many restaurants, including Lucky's Steakhouse, are willing to accommodate special dietary requests and take extra precautions to prevent cross-contamination. However, it's always a good idea to ask about their specific practices and whether they have a dedicated gluten-free preparation area.</p>
