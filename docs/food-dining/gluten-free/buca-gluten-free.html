    <p>A gluten-free dish is one that contains no gluten-containing ingredients and is prepared in a way that avoids cross-contamination with gluten. This means that the kitchen staff must take extra precautions, such as using separate cooking utensils and preparation areas, to ensure that gluten-free dishes remain safe for consumption.</p>
