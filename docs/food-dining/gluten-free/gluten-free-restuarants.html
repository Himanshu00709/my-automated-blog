    <li><strong>Gluten-Free Certification:</strong> Look for restaurants that have been certified by recognized gluten-free organizations. This certification ensures that the restaurant meets strict gluten-free standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Staff Training:</strong> A well-trained staff is crucial. They should be knowledgeable about gluten-free diets and understand the importance of avoiding cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparent Menu:</strong> A good gluten-free restaurant will clearly label gluten-free items on their menu and provide detailed information about ingredients and preparation methods.</li>
</ul>
