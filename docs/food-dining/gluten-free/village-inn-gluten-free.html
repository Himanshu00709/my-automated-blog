<h1>Village Inn Gluten-Free Options: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, Village Inn, a beloved American diner chain, has made strides in accommodating gluten-free diets. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free options available at Village Inn, discuss how they handle cross-contamination, and provide tips for a safe and enjoyable dining experience.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining at Village Inn</h2>

<p>Village Inn is known for its hearty breakfasts, classic comfort foods, and pies. While the menu is not entirely gluten-free, the restaurant offers several gluten-free options that cater to those with dietary restrictions. It’s important to note that Village Inn does not have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen, so cross-contamination is a possibility. However, the staff is trained to handle gluten-free requests with care.</p>

<h3>Gluten-Free Menu Options</h3>

<p>Village Inn’s gluten-free offerings are primarily focused on breakfast and lunch items. Here’s a breakdown of some popular gluten-free choices:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Category</th>
            <th>Gluten-Free Options</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Breakfast</td>
            <td>Scrambled Eggs, Omelets (without toast or pancakes), Fresh Fruit, Hash Browns</td>

    <li><strong>Check for Updates:</strong> Menus can change, so it’s a good idea to check for the latest gluten-free options before you visit.</li>
