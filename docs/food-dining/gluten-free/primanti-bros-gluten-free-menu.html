    <h2>Tips for Dining Gluten-Free at Primanti Bros</h2>

    <p>Dining out with a gluten intolerance or celiac disease requires careful planning. Here are some tips to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience at Primanti Bros:</p>

    <ul>

        <li><strong>Check the Dressing:</strong> Salad dressings and sauces can often contain hidden gluten. Always ask for gluten-free options or stick to simple oil and vinegar.</li>
