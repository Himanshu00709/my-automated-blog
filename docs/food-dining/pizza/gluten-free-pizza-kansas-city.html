<h2>Why Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

<h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

<p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. Here are some factors to consider when choosing a gluten-free pizza:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Crust Quality:</strong> The crust should be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, without being overly dry or crumbly.</li>
    <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> Fresh, high-quality toppings can make or break a pizza. Look for places that use fresh vegetables, premium meats, and high-quality cheeses.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> For those with celiac disease, cross-contamination is a serious concern. Ensure the restaurant has a dedicated gluten-free kitchen or takes precautions to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Health Benefits of Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>

<p>While gluten-free pizza is essential for those with gluten intolerance, it can also offer health benefits for others. Gluten-free crusts are often made with alternative flours like almond, coconut, or rice flour, which can be lower in calories and higher in nutrients. Additionally, gluten-free diets have been linked to improved digestion, increased energy levels, and reduced inflammation for some individuals.</p>
