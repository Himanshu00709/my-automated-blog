    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free pizza is more than just a trend; it's a necessity for many individuals.

Fortunately, gluten-free pizza allows those with dietary restrictions to enjoy this beloved dish without compromising their health.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. A great gluten-free pizza should have a crust that is both flavorful and structurally sound, meaning it should hold up under the weight of toppings without becoming soggy or crumbly. The toppings should be fresh and high-quality, and the overall experience should be as satisfying as a traditional pizza.</p>

    <h3>Crust Matters</h3>
    <p>The crust is the foundation of any pizza, and for gluten-free options, it's even more critical. Many pizzerias use a blend of gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca starch, to create a crust that mimics the texture of traditional dough. Some even offer cauliflower crusts for a low-carb option.</p>

    <h3>Toppings and Sauces</h3>
    <p>When it comes to toppings, the possibilities are endless. However, it's essential to ensure that all ingredients are gluten-free. This includes checking for hidden gluten in sauces, meats, and even some cheeses. Many pizzerias in Clifton Park take extra precautions to avoid cross-contamination, making them a safe choice for those with celiac disease.</p>
