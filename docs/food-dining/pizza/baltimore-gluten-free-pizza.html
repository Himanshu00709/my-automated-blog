    <h1>Baltimore Gluten-Free Pizza: A Delicious Guide</h1>
    <p>For those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, finding a delicious and safe pizza can be a challenge. Fortunately, Baltimore has embraced the gluten-free movement, offering a variety of pizzerias that cater to gluten-free diets. Whether you're a local or just visiting, this guide will help you discover the best gluten-free pizza options in Baltimore.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free pizza is more than just a trend; it's a necessity for many people. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe health issues for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Symptoms can range from digestive problems to skin rashes and even neurological issues. For these individuals, gluten-free pizza isn't just a dietary preferenceâ€”it's a way to enjoy food without compromising their health.</p>

    <h2>Top Gluten-Free Pizza Spots in Baltimore</h2>

    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>
    <p>A great gluten-free pizza starts with the crust. The best gluten-free crusts are made from a blend of gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour. These flours provide the right texture and flavor, mimicking traditional pizza crust without the gluten. Additionally, the toppings and sauces should also be gluten-free, ensuring that the entire pizza is safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</p>

    <p>Another important factor is cross-contamination. Even if a pizza is made with gluten-free ingredients, it can still be contaminated if it's prepared in the same area as gluten-containing foods. Many pizzerias in Baltimore take extra precautions to avoid cross-contamination, such as using separate utensils, pans, and ovens for gluten-free pizzas.</p>

    <h2>FAQs About Gluten-Free Pizza in Baltimore</h2>
    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. Is gluten-free pizza healthier than regular pizza?</h3>
        <p>Not necessarily. While gluten-free pizza is essential for those with gluten sensitivities, it doesn't automatically make it healthier. Some gluten-free crusts can be higher in calories and carbohydrates than traditional crusts. However, many pizzerias offer healthier options, such as whole-grain gluten-free crusts and fresh, organic toppings.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I find vegan gluten-free pizza in Baltimore?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Many pizzerias in Baltimore offer both gluten-free and vegan options. For example, Joe Squared and Pie in the Sky both offer vegan cheese and gluten-free crusts, making it easy to enjoy a pizza that fits both dietary needs.</p>

        <h3>3. How do I know if a pizzeria takes cross-contamination seriously?</h3>
        <p>It's always a good idea to ask the staff about their preparation methods. Many pizzerias will have a dedicated area for gluten-free pizzas and use separate utensils and pans. Some even have separate ovens to ensure there's no cross-contamination.</p>

        <h3>4. Are there any gluten-free pizza delivery options in Baltimore?</h3>
        <p>Yes, many of the pizzerias listed in this guide offer delivery services. Be sure to check their websites or call ahead to confirm that they can accommodate gluten-free orders for delivery.</p>
