    <h1>Gluten-Free Pizza: A Guide to Pizza Chains Offering Celiac-Friendly Options</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding safe and delicious dining options can be a challenge. Pizza, a beloved comfort food, often seems off-limits due to its traditional wheat-based crust.
