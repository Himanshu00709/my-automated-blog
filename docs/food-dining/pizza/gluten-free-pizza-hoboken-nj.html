    <h2>What Makes a Great Gluten-Free Pizza?</h2>

    <p>Not all gluten-free pizzas are created equal. A great gluten-free pizza should have a crust that is both flavorful and has the right texture—crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The toppings should be fresh and high-quality, and the overall experience should be just as satisfying as a traditional pizza. Here are some key factors to consider when choosing a gluten-free pizza:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Crust Quality:</strong> The crust should be made from high-quality gluten-free flours, such as rice flour, almond flour, or a blend of gluten-free grains. It should be well-balanced in terms of flavor and texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Toppings:</strong> Fresh, high-quality toppings are essential. Look for pizzerias that use fresh vegetables, premium meats, and high-quality cheeses.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination:</strong> For those with celiac disease, cross-contamination is a serious concern. Ensure that the pizzeria has strict protocols in place to prevent cross-contamination, such as separate preparation areas and dedicated utensils.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety:</strong> A good gluten-free pizza spot should offer a variety of toppings and styles, from classic Margherita to more adventurous combinations.</li>
    </ul>
