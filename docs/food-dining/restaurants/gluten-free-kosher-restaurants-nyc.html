    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. What does it mean for a restaurant to be gluten-free and kosher?</h3>
        <p>A gluten-free kosher restaurant adheres to both gluten-free dietary restrictions and kosher dietary laws. This means that the food is prepared without gluten-containing ingredients and follows Jewish dietary practices, such as separating meat and dairy and using only kosher-certified ingredients.</p>

        <h3>2. Are all gluten-free foods automatically kosher?</h3>
        <p>No, gluten-free foods are not automatically kosher. While gluten-free foods do not contain gluten, they must still meet kosher dietary laws to be considered kosher. It’s important to look for kosher certification on gluten-free products and restaurant menus.</p>

        <h3>3. Can I find gluten-free kosher options at non-kosher restaurants?</h3>
        <p>While some non-kosher restaurants may offer gluten-free options, they may not adhere to kosher dietary laws. It’s best to dine at restaurants that are certified kosher if you need to follow both gluten-free and kosher diets.</p>

        <h3>4. How can I verify if a restaurant is truly gluten-free and kosher?</h3>
        <p>To verify if a restaurant is truly gluten-free and kosher, look for kosher certification from a recognized authority, such as the Orthodox Union (OU). Additionally, check the restaurant’s menu for gluten-free labels and ask the staff about their preparation methods to ensure there is no cross-contamination.</p>
