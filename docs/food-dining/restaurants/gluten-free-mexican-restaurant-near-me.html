    <h1>Gluten-Free Mexican Restaurants Near Me: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Mexican cuisine is beloved for its vibrant flavors, rich spices, and diverse dishes. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying Mexican food can be a challenge due to the prevalence of wheat-based ingredients like flour tortillas and certain sauces. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free dining options has made it easier than ever to savor authentic Mexican flavors without compromising your health. In this guide, we’ll explore the best gluten-free Mexican restaurants near you, what to look for, and how to enjoy a safe and delicious dining experience.</p>

However, many Mexican restaurants are now offering gluten-free alternatives, such as corn tortillas, naturally gluten-free dishes, and dedicated gluten-free menus. This shift not only caters to dietary restrictions but also highlights the versatility of Mexican cuisine.</p>
