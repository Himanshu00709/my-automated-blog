    <p>Korean cuisine is renowned for its bold flavors, vibrant colors, and diverse ingredients. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, navigating Korean restaurants can be a challenge. Many traditional Korean dishes contain gluten, often hidden in sauces, marinades, and condiments. But fear not!

Additionally, wheat flour is often used in batters for fried foods, and barley is a common ingredient in some traditional Korean beverages. For those who need to avoid gluten, it’s essential to be aware of these hidden sources and to communicate your dietary needs clearly when dining out.</p>

    <h3>3. Japchae (Stir-Fried Glass Noodles)</h3>
    <p>Japchae is a popular Korean dish made with sweet potato starch noodles, which are naturally gluten-free. The dish is typically stir-fried with vegetables and meat, and seasoned with soy sauce. To ensure it’s gluten-free, ask for tamari instead of regular soy sauce.</p>

    <h3>4. Kimchi (Fermented Vegetables)</h3>
