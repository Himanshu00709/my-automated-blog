    <h1>Gluten-Free Friendly Restaurants Near Me</h1>

    <p>Living a gluten-free lifestyle can be challenging, especially when dining out. However, with the increasing awareness of gluten intolerance and celiac disease, many restaurants are now offering gluten-free options.

    <p>Fortunately, the food industry has made significant strides in accommodating gluten-free diets. Many restaurants now offer dedicated gluten-free menus, and some even have separate kitchens to avoid cross-contamination. This makes dining out a more enjoyable and stress-free experience for those who need to avoid gluten.</p>
