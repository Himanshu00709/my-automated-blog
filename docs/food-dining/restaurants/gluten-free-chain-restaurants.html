    <h1>Gluten-Free Chain Restaurants: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free dining options has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing prevalence of celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and a growing awareness of gluten-free diets.

    <h2>Tips for Dining Out Gluten-Free</h2>
    <p>While many chain restaurants offer gluten-free options, it's essential to take precautions to ensure a safe dining experience. Here are some tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Research Ahead:</strong> Check the restaurant's website for gluten-free menus and allergen information.</li>
        <li><strong>Communicate Clearly:</strong> Inform your server about your gluten-free needs and ask about cross-contamination prevention.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> Don't hesitate to ask about ingredients, preparation methods, and kitchen practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Apps:</strong> Utilize gluten-free dining apps like "Find Me Gluten Free" to discover safe restaurants near you.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Cautious with Fried Foods:</strong> Many restaurants fry gluten-free items in the same oil as gluten-containing foods, leading to cross-contamination.</li>
    </ul>
