    <h2>FAQs About Gluten and Dairy-Free Dining</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. What is the difference between gluten-free and dairy-free?</h3>
        <p>Gluten-free refers to foods that do not contain gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Dairy-free means the food does not contain any dairy products, such as milk, cheese, or butter. Some people may need to avoid both gluten and dairy due to allergies, intolerances, or dietary preferences.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I trust restaurant labels for gluten-free and dairy-free options?</h3>
        <p>While many restaurants label their menus clearly, it’s always a good idea to double-check with the staff. Cross-contamination can occur in kitchens, so it’s important to ask about preparation methods to ensure your meal is safe.</p>

        <h3>3. Are there any chains that are known for gluten-free and dairy-free options?</h3>
        <p>Yes, several chains are known for their gluten-free and dairy-free options, including True Food Kitchen, Bareburger, and Chipotle. These restaurants often have dedicated menus or clearly marked options for those with dietary restrictions.</p>

        <h3>4. What should I do if I accidentally consume gluten or dairy?</h3>
        <p>If you accidentally consume gluten or dairy and have a sensitivity or allergy, it’s important to monitor your symptoms. Mild reactions may include bloating or discomfort, while more severe reactions could require medical attention. Always carry any necessary medications, such as antihistamines or an EpiPen, if you have a severe allergy.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

With the increasing availability of gluten-free and dairy-free options, more restaurants are catering to these dietary needs. By doing a little research, asking the right questions, and choosing restaurants that prioritize safe food preparation, you can enjoy a delicious and worry-free meal.
