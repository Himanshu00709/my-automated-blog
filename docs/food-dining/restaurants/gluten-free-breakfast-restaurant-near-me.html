    <h1>Gluten-Free Breakfast Restaurants Near Me: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Finding a gluten-free breakfast restaurant can be a challenge, especially if you're new to the gluten-free lifestyle or traveling to an unfamiliar area.

        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination Prevention:</strong> Ensure the restaurant has protocols in place to prevent cross-contamination, such as separate cooking areas and utensils for gluten-free dishes.</li>
        <li><strong>Knowledgeable Staff:</strong> The staff should be well-informed about gluten-free requirements and able to answer questions about menu items.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety of Options:</strong> A good gluten-free breakfast restaurant should offer a variety of options, from pancakes and waffles to omelets and smoothie bowls.</li>
