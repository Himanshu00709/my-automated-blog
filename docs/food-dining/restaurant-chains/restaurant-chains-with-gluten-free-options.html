<h1>Restaurant Chains with Gluten-Free Options: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free dining options has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the growing popularity of gluten-free diets. For those who must avoid gluten, dining out can often feel like a challenge. However, many restaurant chains have risen to the occasion, offering a variety of gluten-free menu items that cater to these dietary needs. In this article, we’ll explore some of the top restaurant chains that provide gluten-free options, ensuring that you can enjoy a safe and delicious meal without worry.</p>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to serious health complications. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, ingesting gluten can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. As a result, having access to gluten-free options is not just a matter of preference but a necessity for many people.</p>
