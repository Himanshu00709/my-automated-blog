        <li><strong>Allergen Menus:</strong> Detailed allergen menus are provided, listing which items are gluten-free and which may contain gluten.</li>
        <li><strong>Certified Ingredients:</strong> Some restaurants use certified gluten-free ingredients to ensure the highest level of safety.</li>
    </ul>
