<h2>What to Look for When Dining Out</h2>

<p>When searching for a gluten-free burger in DC, it’s important to consider a few key factors to ensure a safe dining experience:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Dedicated Fryers:</strong> Cross-contamination can occur if fries are cooked in the same oil as gluten-containing foods. Look for restaurants that use dedicated fryers for their gluten-free options.</li>
    <li><strong>Gluten-Free Buns:</strong> Some restaurants offer gluten-free buns, while others may provide lettuce wraps as an alternative. Be sure to ask about the ingredients and preparation methods.</li>
    <li><strong>Staff Knowledge:</strong> A well-informed staff can make all the difference. Choose restaurants where the staff is knowledgeable about gluten-free needs and can guide you through the menu.</li>
    <li><strong>Certifications:</strong> Some restaurants may have gluten-free certifications or partnerships with gluten-free organizations, which can provide an extra layer of assurance.</li>
</ul>
