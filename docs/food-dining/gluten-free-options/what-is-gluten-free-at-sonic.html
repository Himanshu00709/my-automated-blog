<h1>What is Gluten-Free at Sonic? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can be a challenge. Fast food restaurants, in particular, often have limited gluten-free options. Sonic Drive-In, known for its extensive menu of burgers, hot dogs, and milkshakes, may not seem like the most gluten-free-friendly place at first glance. However, with a little knowledge and careful selection, you can enjoy a meal at Sonic without worrying about gluten. This guide will walk you through the gluten-free options available at Sonic, as well as tips for avoiding cross-contamination.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Gluten Sensitivity</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For most people, gluten is harmless, but for those with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, including digestive issues, fatigue, and even long-term health complications. Therefore, it's crucial for individuals with these conditions to avoid gluten in their diet.</p>

<p>When dining out, it's important to be aware of hidden sources of gluten, such as sauces, seasonings, and cross-contamination from shared cooking surfaces. Sonic Drive-In, like many fast-food chains, does not have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen, so cross-contamination is a potential risk. However, there are still several menu items that are naturally gluten-free or can be modified to be gluten-free.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Options at Sonic</h2>

<p>While Sonic does not have a specific gluten-free menu, there are several items that are naturally free of gluten or can be customized to avoid gluten-containing ingredients. Below is a list of gluten-free options at Sonic:</p>

<h2>Tips for Avoiding Cross-Contamination</h2>

<p>Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods or surfaces. At Sonic, where the kitchen is not dedicated to gluten-free preparation, cross-contamination is a real concern. Here are some tips to minimize the risk:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Ask Questions:</strong> Don't hesitate to ask the staff about how food is prepared and whether they can take steps to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
    <li><strong>Customize Your Order:</strong> Request that your food be prepared separately, and ask for gluten-free items to be handled with clean gloves and utensils.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid Shared Fryers:</strong> Sonic's French fries and tater tots are cooked in shared fryers, which may also be used for gluten-containing items like onion rings. If you're highly sensitive, it's best to avoid these items.</li>
    <li><strong>Check Ingredients:</strong> Some sauces and seasonings may contain gluten. Always check the ingredients list or ask the staff for clarification.</li>
</ul>
