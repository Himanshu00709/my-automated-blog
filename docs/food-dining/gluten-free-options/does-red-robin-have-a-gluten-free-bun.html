    <h1>Does Red Robin Have a Gluten-Free Bun? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. The question of whether a restaurant offers gluten-free options is crucial, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as a burger bun. Red Robin, a popular American chain known for its gourmet burgers, has been a go-to spot for many burger enthusiasts. But does Red Robin have a gluten-free bun? In this article, we’ll dive deep into Red Robin’s gluten-free offerings, explore their menu, and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

    <p>Before we delve into Red Robin’s menu, it’s essential to understand what gluten is and why it matters. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.

As a result, many people are on the lookout for gluten-free options when dining out.</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Buns at Red Robin</h3>

However, it’s important to note that while the bun itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can still occur in the kitchen. Red Robin takes precautions to minimize this risk, but it’s always a good idea to inform your server about your dietary needs.</p>
