    <h1>What is Gluten-Free at Red Lobster? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Red Lobster is a popular seafood restaurant chain known for its delicious seafood dishes, but for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can be a challenge. Fortunately, Red Lobster offers a variety of gluten-free options to ensure that everyone can enjoy their meals without worry.

Red Lobster has made efforts to accommodate gluten-free diners by offering a dedicated gluten-free menu and training their staff on cross-contamination prevention.
