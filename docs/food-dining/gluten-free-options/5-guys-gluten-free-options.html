    <h1>5 Guys Gluten-Free Options: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>When it comes to fast food, Five Guys is a favorite for many. Known for their customizable burgers, fresh-cut fries, and generous portions, Five Guys has built a loyal following. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can be a challenge. The good news is that Five Guys offers several gluten-free options that allow you to enjoy a delicious meal without worrying about gluten. In this guide, we’ll explore the gluten-free options at Five Guys, how to order safely, and what to watch out for.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Celiac Disease</h2>

    <p>Before diving into the menu, it’s important to understand what gluten is and why it’s a concern for some people. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine. Even small amounts of gluten can cause symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and fatigue. For those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten can cause similar symptoms, though it doesn’t damage the intestine.</p>

    <p>Given the serious health implications, it’s crucial for those with gluten-related disorders to carefully select their food options. Fortunately, Five Guys has taken steps to accommodate gluten-free diets.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Options at Five Guys</h2>

    <p>Five Guys offers a variety of gluten-free options, but it’s important to note that their kitchen is not entirely gluten-free. Cross-contamination is a possibility, so those with severe gluten sensitivities or celiac disease should exercise caution. Here’s a breakdown of the gluten-free options available:</p>

    <h3>Burgers</h3>

    <p>Five Guys burgers are made with 100% fresh beef and are free from gluten-containing ingredients. However, the buns are not gluten-free. To enjoy a gluten-free burger, you can order it "lettuce-wrapped" or "in a bowl." This means your burger will be served without a bun, wrapped in lettuce, or placed in a container with all your favorite toppings.</p>

    <h3>Toppings</h3>

    <p>Five Guys offers a wide range of toppings that are gluten-free. These include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Pickles</li>
        <li>Grilled onions</li>
        <li>Grilled mushrooms</li>
        <li>Green peppers</li>
        <li>Jalapeños</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Hot sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It’s important to avoid certain toppings like ketchup and BBQ sauce, as they may contain gluten or be at risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <h3>Fries</h3>

    <p>One of the highlights of Five Guys is their fresh-cut fries. The fries are cooked in 100% peanut oil and are gluten-free. However, they are cooked in the same fryer as other items that may contain gluten, so there is a risk of cross-contamination. If you’re highly sensitive to gluten, you may want to avoid the fries or ask the staff about their cooking practices.</p>

    <h3>Hot Dogs</h3>

    <p>Five Guys also offers hot dogs, but like the burgers, the buns are not gluten-free. You can order a hot dog "lettuce-wrapped" or "in a bowl" to make it gluten-free. Be sure to check with the staff about the ingredients in the hot dogs, as some brands may contain gluten.</p>

    <h3>Milkshakes</h3>

    <p>Five Guys milkshakes are a popular treat, and the good news is that they are gluten-free. The milkshakes are made with real ice cream and a variety of mix-ins like chocolate, strawberries, and bacon. Just be sure to avoid any mix-ins that may contain gluten, such as cookies or brownies.</p>

    <h2>How to Order Gluten-Free at Five Guys</h2>

    <p>When ordering gluten-free at Five Guys, communication is key. Here are some tips to ensure a safe and enjoyable dining experience:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Specify Your Needs:</strong> Let the staff know that you need a gluten-free meal. Clearly state that you have a gluten allergy or celiac disease so they can take extra precautions.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask About Cross-Contamination:</strong> Inquire about the cooking practices and whether there’s a risk of cross-contamination. For example, ask if the fries are cooked in a dedicated fryer.</li>
        <li><strong>Double-Check Ingredients:</strong> Some toppings and sauces may contain gluten, so always double-check with the staff before adding them to your meal.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider the Lettuce Wrap:</strong> Opting for a lettuce-wrapped burger or hot dog is a safe way to avoid gluten-containing buns.</li>
    </ul>
