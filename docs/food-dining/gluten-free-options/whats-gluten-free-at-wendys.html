    <h1>What's Gluten-Free at Wendy's? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can be a challenge. Fast food restaurants, in particular, often have limited options for those avoiding gluten. However, Wendy's has made strides in offering gluten-free choices, making it a viable option for those on a gluten-free diet. In this guide, we'll explore what's gluten-free at Wendy's, including menu items, cross-contamination risks, and tips for safe dining.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. Therefore, it's crucial to identify safe food options when eating out. Wendy's, like many fast-food chains, has a variety of menu items that are naturally gluten-free, but it's essential to be aware of potential cross-contamination risks.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Menu Items at Wendy's</h2>
    <p>Wendy's offers several menu items that are naturally gluten-free. Below is a table outlining some of the most popular gluten-free options:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Menu Item</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Baked Potato</td>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>
    <p>While Wendy's offers gluten-free options, it's important to note that cross-contamination can occur in the kitchen. Shared cooking surfaces, fryers, and utensils can introduce gluten into otherwise gluten-free foods. For example, Wendy's fries are cooked in the same oil as breaded items, making them unsuitable for those with severe gluten intolerance. Always inform the staff of your dietary restrictions and ask about their preparation methods to minimize risks.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Ordering Gluten-Free at Wendy's</h2>
    <p>To ensure a safe dining experience, follow these tips when ordering gluten-free at Wendy's:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Communicate Clearly:</strong> Inform the staff about your gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Ask them to change gloves and use clean utensils to prepare your food.</li>
        <li><strong>Skip the Bun:</strong> Many sandwiches can be made gluten-free by omitting the bun. Opt for a lettuce wrap or enjoy the sandwich as a salad.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Fried Foods:</strong> As mentioned, Wendy's fries are not gluten-free due to shared fryers. Stick to baked potatoes or other non-fried options.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the Ingredients:</strong> Wendy's provides an allergen menu online, which can help you identify gluten-free options. Always double-check before ordering.</li>
    </ul>
