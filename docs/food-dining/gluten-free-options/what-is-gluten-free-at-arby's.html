<h1>What is Gluten-Free at Arby's? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>For individuals with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those simply choosing to avoid gluten, dining out can be a challenge.

In this guide, we'll explore the gluten-free options available at Arby's, provide tips for safe dining, and answer some frequently asked questions.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and triticale. For those with celiac disease, consuming gluten can lead to severe digestive issues, nutrient malabsorption, and long-term health complications. Even for those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, gluten can cause discomfort and other symptoms. Therefore, it's crucial to identify safe food options when dining out.</p>

<h2>Gluten-Free Options at Arby's</h2>

<p>Arby's menu is primarily centered around sandwiches and breaded items, which are typically high in gluten. However, there are still some gluten-free options available if you know where to look. Below is a breakdown of gluten-free items you can enjoy at Arby's:</p>

    <li>Turkey Breast</li>
