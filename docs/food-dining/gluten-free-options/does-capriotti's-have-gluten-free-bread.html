    <h1>Does Capriotti's Have Gluten-Free Bread? A Detailed Guide</h1>

    <p>Capriotti's Sandwich Shop is a beloved chain known for its delicious, hearty sandwiches. But for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, dining out can be a challenge. One of the most common questions asked by gluten-free diners is: <strong>Does Capriotti's have gluten-free bread?</strong> In this article, we’ll explore the options available at Capriotti's for gluten-free customers, discuss cross-contamination risks, and provide tips for safely enjoying your meal.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Needs</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. As a result, many people are turning to gluten-free diets to manage their health. When dining out, it’s crucial to know whether a restaurant offers gluten-free options and how they handle food preparation to avoid cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Does Capriotti's Offer Gluten-Free Bread?</h2>

    <p>As of the latest information available, Capriotti's does not offer gluten-free bread as a standard menu item. Their sandwiches are traditionally served on freshly baked rolls, which contain gluten. However, this doesn’t mean that gluten-free diners are entirely out of luck. There are still ways to enjoy a meal at Capriotti's while adhering to a gluten-free diet.</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Alternatives at Capriotti's</h3>

    <p>While Capriotti's does not provide gluten-free bread, they do offer a variety of salads and bowls that can be customized to be gluten-free. Here are some options:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Menu Item</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Option</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Salads</td>
                <td>Most salads can be made gluten-free by omitting croutons and choosing a gluten-free dressing.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Bowls</td>
                <td>Capriotti's offers protein bowls that can be customized with gluten-free ingredients.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sandwiches</td>
                <td>While bread is not gluten-free, you can order a sandwich as a lettuce wrap or in a bowl.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks</h2>

Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free food comes into contact with gluten-containing ingredients or surfaces. At Capriotti's, the same preparation areas and utensils are often used for all menu items, which increases the risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>If you have celiac disease or a severe gluten sensitivity, it’s essential to communicate your dietary needs clearly to the staff. While Capriotti's may not have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen, some locations may be willing to take extra precautions to minimize cross-contamination. Always ask about their food preparation practices before ordering.</p>
