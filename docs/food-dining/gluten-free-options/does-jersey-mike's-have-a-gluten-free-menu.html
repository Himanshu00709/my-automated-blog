    <h1>Does Jersey Mike's Have a Gluten-Free Menu? A Detailed Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. The question of whether a restaurant offers gluten-free options is crucial for maintaining a safe and enjoyable dining experience. Jersey Mike's, a popular sub sandwich chain, has gained a reputation for its fresh ingredients and customizable sandwiches. But does Jersey Mike's have a gluten-free menu? In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free options available at Jersey Mike's, how they handle cross-contamination, and what you need to know before ordering.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten and Its Impact</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to long-term health complications. As a result, many individuals must adhere to a strict gluten-free diet. This makes it essential for restaurants to offer safe and reliable gluten-free options.</p>

    <h2>Does Jersey Mike's Offer Gluten-Free Bread?</h2>
    <p>Yes, Jersey Mike's offers gluten-free bread as an option for their sandwiches. The gluten-free bread is made from a blend of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch, providing a texture that closely resembles traditional bread. However, it’s important to note that while the bread itself is gluten-free, the preparation process may introduce cross-contamination risks.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Risks at Jersey Mike's</h2>
    <p>Cross-contamination occurs when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing ingredients or surfaces. At Jersey Mike's, the preparation area is shared, and the same utensils and equipment are often used for both gluten-free and regular sandwiches. This means that even if you order a sandwich on gluten-free bread, there is a risk of cross-contamination.</p>

    <p>To minimize this risk, Jersey Mike's has implemented certain protocols. For example, they use separate cutting boards and knives for gluten-free orders. However, due to the shared preparation space, they cannot guarantee that their gluten-free options are 100% free from cross-contamination. If you have severe gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, it’s important to communicate your needs clearly to the staff and assess your comfort level with the potential risks.</p>
