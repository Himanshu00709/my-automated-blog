    <h1>Does Round Table Have Gluten-Free Pizza? A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. The question of whether a restaurant offers gluten-free options is crucial, especially when it comes to beloved comfort foods like pizza. Round Table Pizza, a popular chain known for its "Last Honest Pizza," has been a go-to spot for pizza lovers for decades. But does Round Table have gluten-free pizza? In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about Round Table’s gluten-free offerings, including ingredients, preparation methods, and what to expect when ordering.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Pizza</h2>

    <p>Before diving into Round Table’s specific offerings, it’s important to understand what makes a pizza gluten-free. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, which are common ingredients in traditional pizza dough. For a pizza to be considered gluten-free, it must be made with alternative flours such as rice flour, almond flour, or tapioca flour. Additionally, the preparation process must avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing ingredients.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free pizza has become increasingly popular, not only among those with gluten-related disorders but also among health-conscious individuals. Many pizza chains have responded to this demand by introducing gluten-free crust options. But how does Round Table Pizza stack up?</p>

    <h2>Round Table’s Gluten-Free Pizza Options</h2>

    <p>Round Table Pizza does offer a gluten-free pizza option, catering to customers who need or prefer to avoid gluten. The gluten-free crust is made from a blend of rice flour, potato starch, and other gluten-free ingredients. However, it’s important to note that while the crust itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can occur during preparation, especially in a kitchen that also handles traditional pizza dough.</p>

    <p>Here’s a breakdown of Round Table’s gluten-free pizza options:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Pizza Type</th>
                <th>Gluten-Free Crust Available</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Classic Cheese</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
                <td>Made with gluten-free crust and mozzarella cheese.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pepperoni</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
                <td>Gluten-free crust with pepperoni and cheese.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Vegetarian</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
                <td>Gluten-free crust with a variety of vegetables and cheese.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Custom Pizzas</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
                <td>You can build your own pizza with gluten-free crust and toppings.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>While Round Table does offer gluten-free crust, it’s essential to communicate your dietary needs clearly when ordering. Inform the staff about your gluten intolerance or celiac disease so they can take extra precautions to minimize cross-contamination.</p>

    <h2>Cross-Contamination Concerns</h2>

    <p>One of the biggest challenges for those with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity is the risk of cross-contamination. Even if a pizza is made with gluten-free ingredients, it can still come into contact with gluten during preparation. This can happen through shared utensils, cutting boards, or even the same oven used for regular pizzas.</p>

    <p>Round Table Pizza acknowledges this risk and advises customers with severe gluten allergies to exercise caution. While the chain takes steps to reduce cross-contamination, such as using separate preparation areas and utensils, the possibility of trace amounts of gluten cannot be entirely eliminated. If you have a severe gluten allergy, it’s always best to consult with the restaurant staff and make an informed decision based on your comfort level.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Information</h2>

    <p>For those who are health-conscious or have specific dietary needs, understanding the nutritional content of gluten-free pizza is important. Here’s a comparison of Round Table’s gluten-free crust versus their traditional crust:</p>
