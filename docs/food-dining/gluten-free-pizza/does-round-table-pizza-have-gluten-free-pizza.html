    <h1>Does Round Table Pizza Have Gluten-Free Pizza?</h1>

    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, finding a safe and delicious pizza option can be a challenge. Round Table Pizza, a popular pizza chain known for its "Last Honest Pizza," has been a go-to spot for pizza lovers for decades. But does Round Table Pizza offer gluten-free options? In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free offerings at Round Table Pizza, how they cater to gluten-sensitive customers, and what you need to know before ordering.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Diets</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, consuming gluten can lead to serious health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term damage to the small intestine. As a result, many individuals must adhere to a strict gluten-free diet. This has led to an increased demand for gluten-free options at restaurants, including pizza chains like Round Table Pizza.</p>

    <h2>Round Table Pizza's Gluten-Free Options</h2>

    <p>Round Table Pizza has recognized the growing need for gluten-free options and has introduced a gluten-free pizza crust to its menu. This crust is made from a blend of rice flour, potato starch, and other gluten-free ingredients, providing a safe alternative for those who cannot consume gluten. However, it’s important to note that while the crust itself is gluten-free, cross-contamination can still occur in the kitchen. Round Table Pizza does not have a dedicated gluten-free kitchen, so there is a risk of gluten exposure during preparation.</p>

    <h3>Gluten-Free Pizza Toppings</h3>

    <p>When ordering a gluten-free pizza at Round Table Pizza, you can choose from a variety of toppings. Most of their standard toppings, such as pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and onions, are naturally gluten-free. However, some toppings, like certain sauces or specialty meats, may contain gluten. It’s always a good idea to check with the staff or consult the allergen menu to ensure that your chosen toppings are safe.</p>

    <h3>Nutritional Information</h3>

    <p>For those who are health-conscious or have specific dietary needs, Round Table Pizza provides nutritional information for their gluten-free crust. Below is a table summarizing the nutritional content of their gluten-free pizza crust:</p>
