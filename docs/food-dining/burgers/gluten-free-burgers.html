You can also make your own gluten-free buns at home using a gluten-free flour blend.</p>

    <h3>3. Add Gluten-Free Toppings</h3>

    <p>When it comes to toppings, the possibilities are endless. Fresh vegetables like lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pickles are naturally gluten-free. However, be cautious with condiments like ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise, as some brands may contain gluten. Always check the labels or opt for certified gluten-free versions.</p>

    <h3>4. Cook Your Burger</h3>

    <p>Cook your burger patty to your desired level of doneness. Whether you prefer grilling, pan-frying, or baking, make sure to use clean utensils and cookware to avoid cross-contamination with gluten-containing foods.</p>

    <h3>5. Assemble and Enjoy</h3>

    <p>Once your patty is cooked, assemble your burger with your gluten-free bun and toppings. Serve with a side of gluten-free fries or a fresh salad for a complete meal.</p>
