    <h1>CPK Gluten-Free Pizza Review: A Delicious and Safe Option for Gluten-Sensitive Diners</h1>
    <p>California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) has long been a favorite among pizza lovers for its innovative and diverse menu. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying a slice of pizza can often feel like a distant dream. Enter CPK's gluten-free pizza—a menu option that promises to deliver the same great taste without the gluten. In this detailed review, we’ll dive into the taste, texture, and overall experience of CPK’s gluten-free pizza, as well as provide some insights into its nutritional value and how it stacks up against traditional pizza options.</p>

    <h2>What Makes CPK’s Gluten-Free Pizza Stand Out?</h2>
    <p>CPK’s gluten-free pizza is crafted with a rice-based crust, which is designed to mimic the texture and flavor of traditional pizza dough. The crust is thin and crispy, offering a satisfying crunch without being overly dense. What sets CPK apart is their commitment to ensuring that their gluten-free pizzas are prepared in a way that minimizes cross-contamination, making it a safer option for those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance.</p>

    <h2>Taste and Texture: A Closer Look</h2>
    <p>The first thing you’ll notice when you bite into a slice of CPK’s gluten-free pizza is the crust. Unlike some gluten-free options that can be dry or crumbly, CPK’s crust is surprisingly moist and holds together well. The rice-based crust has a slightly nutty flavor that complements the toppings rather than overpowering them. Whether you opt for a classic Margherita or a more adventurous BBQ Chicken pizza, the crust provides a sturdy base that enhances the overall eating experience.</p>

    <p>As for the toppings, CPK doesn’t skimp on quality. Fresh ingredients are used across the board, from the tangy tomato sauce to the generous portions of cheese and meats. The balance of flavors is well-executed, ensuring that each bite is as delicious as the last. For those who enjoy a bit of heat, the Spicy Chipotle Chicken pizza is a must-try, offering a smoky, spicy kick that pairs perfectly with the gluten-free crust.</p>

    <h2>Nutritional Breakdown</h2>
    <p>For those who are health-conscious or have specific dietary needs, understanding the nutritional content of CPK’s gluten-free pizza is essential. Below is a table that breaks down the nutritional information for a standard 10-inch gluten-free pizza:</p>
