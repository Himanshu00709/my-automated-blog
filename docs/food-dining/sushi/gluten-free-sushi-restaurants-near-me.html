    <h1>Gluten-Free Sushi Restaurants Near Me: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>For those who love sushi but need to adhere to a gluten-free diet, finding the right restaurant can be a challenge. Sushi, traditionally made with rice, fish, and seaweed, seems like a safe bet. However, many sushi ingredients, such as soy sauce and imitation crab, contain gluten. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free awareness has led to an increase in sushi restaurants offering gluten-free options. In this article, we’ll explore some of the best gluten-free sushi restaurants near you, what to look for, and how to enjoy sushi without compromising your dietary needs.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Sushi?</h2>

    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, fatigue, and even long-term damage to the intestines. Traditional sushi ingredients like soy sauce, tempura, and certain types of vinegar contain gluten, making it essential to find restaurants that cater to gluten-free diets.</p>

    <p>Gluten-free sushi restaurants use alternative ingredients and preparation methods to ensure that their dishes are safe for those with gluten intolerance. This includes using tamari (a gluten-free soy sauce), ensuring that all ingredients are free from cross-contamination, and offering a variety of gluten-free rolls and sashimi options.</p>
