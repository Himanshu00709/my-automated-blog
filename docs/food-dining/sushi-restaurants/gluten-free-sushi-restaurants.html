    <h1>Gluten-Free Sushi Restaurants: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Sushi is a beloved culinary art form that has captivated food enthusiasts worldwide. However, for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease, enjoying sushi can be a challenge due to the presence of soy sauce and other gluten-containing ingredients. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free sushi restaurants has made it possible for everyone to savor this Japanese delicacy without worry. In this article, we’ll explore the world of gluten-free sushi, highlighting the best practices, top restaurants, and tips for enjoying sushi safely.</p>

    <h2>What Makes Sushi Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Traditional sushi ingredients like rice, fish, and vegetables are naturally gluten-free. However, the issue arises with condiments and preparation methods. Soy sauce, a staple in sushi dining, typically contains wheat, making it unsafe for those avoiding gluten. Additionally, some imitation crab and tempura batter are also gluten-laden. To ensure sushi is gluten-free, restaurants must use tamari (a gluten-free soy sauce alternative) and avoid cross-contamination during preparation.</p>
