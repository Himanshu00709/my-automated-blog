In this article, we’ll take a deep dive into Mr. Mike's gluten-free offerings, exploring the options available, the precautions taken, and why this menu stands out in the crowded restaurant landscape.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Dining</h2>
    <p>Before we delve into the specifics of Mr. Mike's gluten-free menu, it’s important to understand what "gluten-free" truly means. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can cause serious health issues for those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. A gluten-free diet eliminates these grains entirely, which can be challenging when dining out due to cross-contamination risks.</p>
    <p>Mr. Mike's has taken significant steps to ensure that their gluten-free menu is not only diverse but also safe for those with gluten-related health concerns. From dedicated cooking areas to staff training, the restaurant has gone above and beyond to cater to this growing demographic.</p>

    <h3>Appetizers</h3>
    <p>Starting your meal with an appetizer is a must, and Mr. Mike's offers several gluten-free options to kick off your dining experience. The <strong>Gluten-Free Wings</strong> are a fan favorite, coated in a tangy sauce that’s free from gluten-containing ingredients. For something lighter, the <strong>Caesar Salad</strong> (without croutons) is a refreshing choice.</p>

    <h3>Main Courses</h3>
    <p>The main courses at Mr. Mike's are where the gluten-free menu truly shines.
