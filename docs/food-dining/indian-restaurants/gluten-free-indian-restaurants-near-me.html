    <h2>Tips for Dining Gluten-Free at Indian Restaurants</h2>
    <p>While many Indian restaurants are becoming more accommodating to gluten-free diets, it’s essential to take certain precautions to ensure a safe dining experience. Here are some tips:</p>

    <h3>1. Communicate Your Dietary Needs</h3>
    <p>Always inform your server about your gluten intolerance or celiac disease. Many Indian restaurants are familiar with gluten-free diets and can guide you to safe options. Don’t hesitate to ask questions about ingredients and preparation methods.</p>

    <h3>2. Stick to Naturally Gluten-Free Dishes</h3>
    <p>Many Indian dishes are naturally gluten-free, such as rice-based dishes like biryani, lentil-based dishes like dal, and vegetable curries. Avoid dishes that typically contain wheat, such as naan, paratha, and certain types of samosas.</p>

    <h3>3. Be Cautious with Sauces and Spices</h3>
    <p>Some Indian sauces and spice blends may contain gluten as a thickening agent or filler. Always ask if the restaurant uses gluten-free spices and sauces. Many restaurants now offer gluten-free versions of popular sauces like tikka masala and korma.</p>

    <h3>4. Check for Cross-Contamination</h3>
    <p>Cross-contamination can occur when gluten-free foods come into contact with gluten-containing foods. Ensure that the restaurant has separate preparation areas and utensils for gluten-free dishes. Some restaurants even have dedicated gluten-free kitchens.</p>
