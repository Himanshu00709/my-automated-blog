<h1>Gluten-Free Sub Shops: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, driven by the increasing awareness of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and the growing popularity of gluten-free diets for health and wellness. For those who love sandwiches but need to avoid gluten, finding a reliable gluten-free sub shop can be a game-changer. This guide will explore everything you need to know about gluten-free sub shops, from what to look for to some of the best options available.</p>

<h2>What Makes a Sub Shop Gluten-Free?</h2>

<p>Not all sub shops are created equal when it comes to gluten-free options. A truly gluten-free sub shop goes beyond just offering gluten-free bread.

Here are some key factors to consider:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Gluten-Free Bread:</strong> The bread is the foundation of any sub, and it must be certified gluten-free. Look for sub shops that use high-quality gluten-free bread that doesn’t compromise on taste or texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Contamination Prevention:</strong> The shop should have strict protocols in place to prevent cross-contamination. This includes using separate utensils, cutting boards, and preparation areas for gluten-free orders.</li>
    <li><strong>Ingredient Transparency:</strong> The shop should provide clear information about the ingredients used in their subs, including any potential sources of gluten.</li>
</ul>
