    <h1>Gluten-Free Sandwiches in Chicago: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

    <p>Chicago, a city renowned for its diverse culinary scene, has embraced the gluten-free movement with open arms. For those with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or simply a preference for gluten-free options, the Windy City offers a plethora of delicious and safe sandwich options. In this guide, we’ll explore some of the best spots in Chicago to enjoy gluten-free sandwiches, along with tips for navigating the gluten-free landscape in the city.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Matters</h2>

    <p>Gluten-free diets are essential for individuals with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Even small amounts of gluten can cause severe health issues for those with celiac disease. Additionally, some people may have non-celiac gluten sensitivity, experiencing symptoms like bloating, headaches, and fatigue after consuming gluten. For these individuals, finding reliable gluten-free options is crucial for maintaining their health and well-being.</p>

    <h2>Top Gluten-Free Sandwich Spots in Chicago</h2>

        <li><strong>Staff Training:</strong> Ensure that the staff is knowledgeable about gluten-free preparation and can answer your questions confidently.</li>
    </ul>
