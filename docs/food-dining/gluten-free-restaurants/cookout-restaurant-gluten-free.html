    <h1>Gluten-Free Dining at Cookout Restaurants: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, dining out can often feel like navigating a minefield. However, with the increasing awareness of gluten-free diets, many restaurants, including Cookout, have started to offer gluten-free options. In this article, we’ll explore the gluten-free offerings at Cookout restaurants, provide tips for safe dining, and answer some frequently asked questions about gluten-free dining.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Gluten-Free Diets</h2>
    <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. For those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to a range of symptoms, from digestive issues to more severe health complications. A gluten-free diet eliminates all foods containing gluten, which means avoiding many common ingredients like bread, pasta, and certain sauces.</p>
    <p>When dining out, it’s crucial to ensure that the food is not only gluten-free but also prepared in a way that avoids cross-contamination. This is especially important in fast-food restaurants, where kitchen spaces are often shared, and the risk of cross-contact is higher.</p>

    <h2>Gluten-Free Options at Cookout</h2>
    <p>Cookout, a popular fast-food chain known for its burgers, hot dogs, and milkshakes, has made strides in accommodating gluten-free diners. While the menu is not entirely gluten-free, there are several options that can be safely enjoyed by those avoiding gluten.</p>
