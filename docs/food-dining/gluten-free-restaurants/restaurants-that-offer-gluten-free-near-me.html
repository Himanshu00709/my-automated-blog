    <h1>Gluten-Free Restaurants Near Me: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Living with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity can make dining out a challenge. However, the growing awareness of gluten-free diets has led to an increase in restaurants offering gluten-free options.

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Dining Matters</h2>
    <p>For individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, consuming gluten can lead to severe health issues, including digestive problems, nutrient deficiencies, and long-term complications. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it can be hidden in many foods. Therefore, finding restaurants that offer gluten-free options is not just a matter of preference but a necessity for maintaining health and well-being.</p>

        <li><strong>Dedicated Gluten-Free Menu:</strong> Look for restaurants that offer a separate gluten-free menu. This indicates that the establishment is knowledgeable about gluten-free needs and takes precautions to avoid cross-contamination.</li>
        <li><strong>Certified Gluten-Free:</strong> Some restaurants are certified by gluten-free organizations, which means they have undergone rigorous testing and training to ensure their food is safe for those with gluten sensitivities.</li>
        <li><strong>Staff Training:</strong> A well-trained staff can answer your questions about ingredients and preparation methods, helping you make informed choices.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Contamination Prevention:</strong> Ensure the restaurant has protocols in place to prevent cross-contamination, such as separate cooking areas and utensils for gluten-free dishes.</li>
