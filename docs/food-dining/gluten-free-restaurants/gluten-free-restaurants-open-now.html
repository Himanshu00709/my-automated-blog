<h1>Gluten-Free Restaurants Open Now: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free dining options has skyrocketed. Whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or personal dietary preferences, more people are seeking out restaurants that cater to their needs. Fortunately, many eateries have risen to the occasion, offering delicious and safe gluten-free meals. In this guide, we’ll explore some of the best gluten-free restaurants open now, providing you with a variety of options to satisfy your cravings.</p>

<h2>Why Gluten-Free Dining Matters</h2>

<p>Gluten-free dining is not just a trend; for many, it’s a necessity. Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, affects approximately 1% of the population. Additionally, non-celiac gluten sensitivity can cause similar symptoms, such as bloating, fatigue, and digestive issues. For these individuals, dining out can be a challenge, as cross-contamination or hidden gluten in sauces and seasonings can lead to adverse health effects. Therefore, finding restaurants that prioritize gluten-free options is crucial for maintaining health and well-being.</p>
