    <h2>Tips for Dining Gluten-Free in Pigeon Forge</h2>
    <p>Dining out gluten-free can be a daunting task, especially in a tourist-heavy area like Pigeon Forge. However, with a little preparation and knowledge, you can enjoy a safe and satisfying meal. Here are some tips to help you navigate gluten-free dining in Pigeon Forge:</p>

    <h3>1. Research Restaurants Ahead of Time</h3>
    <p>Before heading out, take some time to research restaurants in Pigeon Forge that offer gluten-free options. Many restaurants now have their menus available online, and some even have dedicated gluten-free menus. Websites like Find Me Gluten Free and Yelp can also be valuable resources for finding gluten-free-friendly restaurants.</p>

    <h3>2. Communicate with the Staff</h3>
    <p>When dining out, don’t hesitate to communicate your dietary needs to the restaurant staff. Inform your server about your gluten intolerance or celiac disease, and ask questions about how the food is prepared. Many restaurants are willing to accommodate special requests, such as using separate cooking utensils or preparing your meal in a dedicated gluten-free area.</p>

    <h3>3. Be Cautious with Cross-Contamination</h3>
    <p>Cross-contamination is a common concern for those with gluten sensitivities. Even if a restaurant offers gluten-free options, there’s always a risk of cross-contamination if the food is prepared in the same area as gluten-containing items. To minimize this risk, ask the staff about their procedures for preventing cross-contamination and choose restaurants that take extra precautions.</p>

    <h3>4. Bring Your Own Gluten-Free Snacks</h3>
    <p>While Pigeon Forge has plenty of gluten-free dining options, it’s always a good idea to bring your own gluten-free snacks, especially if you’re planning a full day of activities. This way, you’ll have something safe to eat in case you can’t find a suitable restaurant or if you’re in a hurry.</p>
