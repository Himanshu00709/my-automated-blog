    <h1>Exploring the World of Gluten-Free Restaurants</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free dining options has skyrocketed. Whether due to celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or a personal preference for a gluten-free lifestyle, more people are seeking restaurants that cater to their dietary needs. Gluten-free restaurants are no longer a niche market; they are becoming a staple in the culinary world. This blog post will delve into the rise of gluten-free dining, what to look for in a gluten-free restaurant, and some of the best gluten-free dining experiences around the world.</p>

    <h2>The Rise of Gluten-Free Dining</h2>
    <p>The gluten-free movement has gained significant traction over the past decade. According to recent studies, the global gluten-free food market is expected to reach $7.59 billion by 2027. This growth is driven by increasing awareness of celiac disease, a condition that affects approximately 1% of the global population, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which impacts an even larger group. As a result, restaurants are adapting to meet the needs of gluten-free diners, offering everything from gluten-free pizzas to pastries.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Restaurant Truly Gluten-Free?</h2>
    <p>Not all restaurants that offer gluten-free options are created equal. For individuals with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivity, cross-contamination can be a serious issue. A truly gluten-free restaurant takes extra precautions to ensure that gluten-free dishes are prepared in a dedicated gluten-free kitchen, using separate utensils, cookware, and preparation areas. Here are some key factors to consider when choosing a gluten-free restaurant:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Factor</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Dedicated Kitchen</td>
                <td>The restaurant has a separate kitchen area exclusively for preparing gluten-free meals.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Certified Gluten-Free</td>
                <td>The restaurant is certified by a recognized gluten-free organization, ensuring compliance with strict standards.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Staff Training</td>
                <td>The staff is well-trained in gluten-free protocols and can confidently answer questions about the menu.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Menu Transparency</td>
                <td>The menu clearly labels gluten-free options and provides detailed ingredient lists.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
