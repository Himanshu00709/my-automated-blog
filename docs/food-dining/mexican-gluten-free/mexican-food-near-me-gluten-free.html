    <h1>Gluten-Free Mexican Food Near Me: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Mexican cuisine is celebrated worldwide for its vibrant flavors, rich history, and diverse ingredients. However, for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, enjoying Mexican food can be a challenge due to the prevalence of wheat-based ingredients like flour tortillas and certain sauces. Fortunately, the rise of gluten-free awareness has led to an increasing number of Mexican restaurants offering gluten-free options. In this guide, we’ll explore how to find the best gluten-free Mexican food near you, what dishes to look for, and tips for dining safely.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Mexican Food is a Game-Changer</h2>
    <p>Gluten-free Mexican food is not just a trend; it’s a necessity for many people. Gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, can cause severe health issues for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Traditional Mexican dishes often rely on corn-based ingredients, which are naturally gluten-free, making it easier to adapt recipes. From corn tortillas to tamales, many staples of Mexican cuisine are inherently safe for gluten-free diets. However, cross-contamination and hidden gluten in sauces or marinades can still pose risks, so it’s essential to choose restaurants that prioritize gluten-free preparation.</p>

    <h2>Popular Gluten-Free Mexican Dishes</h2>
    <p>When dining out, it’s helpful to know which dishes are typically gluten-free or can be easily modified. Here are some popular options:</p>
