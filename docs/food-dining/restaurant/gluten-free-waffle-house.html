<h1>Gluten-Free Waffle House: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>

<p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, and the food industry has responded with a variety of gluten-free alternatives.

<h2>Preparation Practices at Waffle House</h2>

<p>Waffle House takes the issue of cross-contamination seriously. The staff is trained to handle gluten-free orders with care, using separate utensils and cooking surfaces whenever possible.

<ul>
    <li><strong>Communicate Clearly:</strong> Inform your server about your gluten-free requirements as soon as you’re seated.</li>

    <li><strong>Request Separate Cooking Surfaces:</strong> Ask if your food can be prepared on a clean grill or in a separate pan to minimize cross-contamination.</li>
</ul>
