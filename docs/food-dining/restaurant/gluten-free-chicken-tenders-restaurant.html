    <h1>Gluten-Free Chicken Tenders: A Restaurant Guide</h1>
    <p>In recent years, the demand for gluten-free options has skyrocketed, and restaurants have risen to the occasion by offering delicious, safe alternatives for those with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease. Among the most popular gluten-free menu items are chicken tenders—a classic comfort food that can now be enjoyed by everyone. This blog post will explore the best gluten-free chicken tenders restaurants, what makes them stand out, and why they are a must-try for anyone seeking a tasty, gluten-free meal.</p>

    <h2>Why Gluten-Free Chicken Tenders?</h2>
    <p>Chicken tenders are a beloved dish for many, but traditional recipes often rely on wheat-based breading, making them off-limits for those avoiding gluten. Gluten-free chicken tenders, however, use alternative flours like rice flour, almond flour, or cornmeal to achieve the same crispy texture without the gluten. These tenders are not only safe for those with gluten intolerance but also a healthier option for anyone looking to reduce their gluten intake.</p>
